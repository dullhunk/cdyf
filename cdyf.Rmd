You'll be introduced to professional issues in computer science, exploring techniques for making career decisions, job searching, submitting applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace. Alongside the practical engineering issues of coding and testing your future, this guidebook also encourages you to design your future by taking a step back and thinking more strategically. You will apply computational thinking techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people, what your experience is to date and where you want to be in the future.

```
Hello and welcome to *Coding Your Future* ([cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me)) the guidebook that will help you to design, engineer, test and `code` your future in computing. Also available as a free ebook and pdf (see section \@ref(downloading)), this guide is aimed at ALL students in higher education. While the guide supports undergraduate teaching at the University of Manchester, it doesn't actually matter:

* *where* in the world you are studying
* what *stage* of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year
* what *level* you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate
* what *institution* you are studying at, this book is University and institution agnostic
* what *subject* you are studying, as long as you are **computationally curious**

There is something in this guidebook for *any* student of computing, both those inside and outside of Computer Science departments. üë®üèø‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíªüë©üèΩ‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíªüë©üèø‚Äçüíª

## Imagining your future {#picturethis}
This is a self-help guide but a lot of self-help literature can be dry, dull, textbooky, generic and boring with few illustrations and conversations. In the novel *[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)* [@wonderland] shown in figure \@ref(fig:aiw-fig), the protagonist Alice wonders why her sister is reading a book without pictures.


```{r aiw-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionalicecover)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/alicequotation.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionalicecover) Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‚Äúand what is the use of a book,‚Äù thought Alice ‚Äúwithout pictures or conversations? [@wonderland] Public domain image of the cover of the 1898 edition of the novel *[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)* via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3S4C](https://w.wiki/3S4C) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Pictures tell stories, pictures explain. Pictures help you understand. Pictures help you imagine. So this book uses pictures (and conversations) to help you visualise your future. Other key differences between this and other guidebooks are outlined in section \@ref(thinkdifferent).

## Your future aims {#vaccine}
This guidebook aims to help you develop stronger habits of mind, body and soul using five key ingredients, `C`, `D`, `Y`, `F` and `.me`:

1. **`C is for CODE`**: Instructions, algorithms, recipes, methods and strategies contained in this guidebook. This `code` is for your consumption, not for a machine.
1. **`D is for DATA`**: Data, data everywhere. Facts, statistics, graphs and pictures collected together for your analysis
1. **`Y is for YOU`**: This book is all about you, with activities and other *coding challenges* for you to do in addition to just passively reading
1. **`F is for FUTURES`**: Possible futures for you to think about. Try not to dwell on the past. Think about the future. Think about *your* future. [@thinkaboutthefuture; @wroteforluck]
1. **`.me is for ME`**: Hello, my name is Duncan, see figure \@ref(fig:hello-my-name-fig). I'm your tour guide here. If you're feeling a bit lost, follow me and together we can code your future.


```{r hello-my-name-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "89%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionhellomyname)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Hello-my-name-is-Duncan.png")
```

(ref:captionhellomyname) Hello my name is [Duncan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_(given_name)). If you're feeling a bit lost, follow me. Image adapted from *Hello my name is ... sticker* by Eviatar Bach, public domain [w.wiki/32RV](https://w.wiki/32RV)

*Coding your future* explores techniques for investigating career possibilities, job searching, making career decisions, submitting applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace.

Alongside these practical engineering issues, this guidebook also encourages you to *design your future* by taking a step back and reflecting on the bigger picture. You will apply [computational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking) techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people and what your experience is. As there is a computational theme, you will also need to reflect on what your [inputs and outputs (I/O)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output) are, both now and in the future. You'll also need to think about what recipes (or algorithms) you might start experimenting with

This guidebook investigates professional and pastoral issues in computing, for those with and without Computer Science degrees in the early stage of their careers.

<!--We will also discuss some algorithms (recipes) that you might like to try-->

## What you won't learn {#nilo}
This guidebook will NOT teach you how to write code, there's already lots of fantastic resources to help you do that. We discuss some of them in chapter \@ref(computing) on *computing your future*.

## Learning your future {#bilo}

So what *will* you learn from this guidebook? After reading this guidebook, watching the videos and doing the exercises you will be able to:

1. Improve your self-awareness by describing who you are, what motivates you and your strengths and weaknesses
1. Decide on and adjust your job search strategies
1. Identify employers, sectors and roles that are of interest to you		
1. Improve your written communication skills both for job applications and communicating with other people
1. Plan and prepare competitive written applications using standard techniques including CVs, covering letters, application forms and digital profiles
1. Compete confidently and successfully in interviews. Anticipate and prepare for technical and non-technical questions
1. Plan further possibilities in your career such as promotion, postgraduate study & research, alternative employment and longer term goals
1. Search and navigate a large ‚Äúwordbase‚Äù (this guidebook and the work it cites). A wordbase is like a [`codebase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebase), only written predominantly in natural language.

<!--codebase, documentbase, languagebase, wordbase-->

### Your future requirements {#prereq}
As the title of this guidebook implies, there is a computational flavour here, but you do not have to be studying Computer Science to benefit. There are two main target audiences for this guidebook:

1. Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of their degree. This includes software engineering, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction (HCI), information systems, health informatics, data science, gaming, cybersecurity and all the other myriad flavours of Computer Science
1. Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying *any* subject, with little or no Computer Science at all. You are curious to know about what role computing could play in your future career because computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists, see chapter \@ref(computing) on *Computing your Future*

So the prerequisites for this book are that you are studying (or have studied) at University where English is one of the main spoken languages. You *may* have some experience already, either casual, voluntary or otherwise, but this book does **not** assume that you have already been employed in some capacity.

### Gutting your future {#gut}
Reading this book from cover to cover like a novel is not recommended. That would be foolish.

```{r gut-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongut)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fish-gutting.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiongut) Don't *read* this book, [disembowel it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disembowelment)! Eviscerate it! Gut it like a fish! Enjoy the nourishing flesh and discard the less appetising organs of its gastrointestinal tract. You'll need to decide which is which, depending on your tastes and appetite. CC0 Public domain image of fish gutting by Wilfredor via Wikimedia commons [w.wiki/_23m](https://w.wiki/_23m) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Instead of reading this book, I suggest you follow the advice given to historian [William Woodruff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodruff) about reading books when he was at University:

> ‚ÄúYou don't READ books, you GUT them!‚Äù
> `r tufte::quote_footer('--- William Woodruff [@nabend]')`

So, gut this book like the fish in figure \@ref(fig:gut-fig). Identify the chapters that are most useful to you (the flesh), and skip the rest (the guts). Which chapters are flesh and which are guts will depend on what stage of the journey you are at. This guidebook is designed to be as ‚Äúguttable‚Äù as possible. To aid gutting, the version published at [cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me/) has a built in search and tables of contents. Before you can gut the fish, you'll need an anatomical map shown in figure \@ref(fig:map-fig).

## Mapping your future {#mapping}
<!-- or should it be structuring-->
This guidebook is split into four parts. The first part (Chapters \@ref(rebooting) to \@ref(computing)) is on design while the second  part (chapters \@ref(debugging) to \@ref(researching)) is on building and testing your future shown in the map in figure \@ref(fig:map-fig). The third part is a help section for supporting your future (chapters \@ref(ruling) to \@ref(scheduling)) while in the final part from chapters \@ref(raluca) to \@ref(reading) we meet some students who are coding their future. Let's look in a bit more detail at the content of each of the four parts of this guidebook:

```{r map-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmapping)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Course Map V3.png")
```
(ref:captionmapping) Mapping your future: Each yellow dot on this diagram is a chapter in *Coding Your Future*. The chapters on the left tackle design issues like *who are you*? Chapters on the right tackle the practicalities of executing and testing your career choices, such as *debugging your CV*.

### Designing your future {#parti}

The first six chapters of this guidebook look at what engineers call *design*. When you build anything, a bridge, a piece of software, a car or a plane you'll need to do some design like the blueprint in figure \@ref(fig:brooklyn-fig)

```{r brooklyn-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionblueprint)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/brooklyn-bridge-blueprint.png")
```
(ref:captionblueprint) Designing your future is about drawing up a [blueprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint), like this one for the elevation of the [Brooklyn Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge) in New York. What does your blueprint look like? Chapter's \@ref(rebooting) through to \@ref(computing) will help you design your future.


Building a career isn't that different to building anything else, you'll need to do some design work and it will probably be iterative. Designing things often involves answering tricky questions. So when you're designing your future you'll need to cover the following:

* Chapter \@ref(rebooting): *Rebooting your future* discusses why you should bother reading this guidebook
* Chapter \@ref(knowing): *Knowing your future* challenges you to reflect on who you are, what makes you unique and why you are here
* Chapter \@ref(nurturing): *Nurturing your future* encourages you to take care of your mental and physical health
* Chapter \@ref(writing): *Writing your future* explores your soft skills, and how they complement your hard skills and why employers value them so much
* Chapter \@ref(experiencing): *Experiencing your future* asks you to reflect on your work experience and help identify where you can improve it
* Chapter \@ref(computing): *Computing your future* looks at the role computing can play in your career, especially if Computer Science is not a major part of your degree


### Building your future {#partii}
The next seven chapters look at building (and testing) your future, what engineers like to call *implementation* or *execution* shown in figure \@ref(fig:manhattan-fig).

```{r manhattan-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbridge)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/manhattan_bridge.png")
```
(ref:captionbridge) Just like the [Manhattan Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Bridge), your future will be easier to build once you've done some preliminary design. You don't need a grand design with tonnes of details, a simple sketch will do. Design questions are covered in the first part of this guidebook on designing your future. Picture of the Manhattan bridge under construction in 1909 adapted from a public domain image via Wikimedia commons [w.wiki/32Rg](https://w.wiki/32Rg)

Once you've started to answer the design questions in the first part, you can start to implement (or build) your career and think about what the next steps will be.

* Chapter \@ref(debugging): *Debugging your future* looks at debugging your written communication such as covering letters,  application forms and digital portfolios.
* Chapter \@ref(finding): *Finding your future* looks at where and how can you look for interesting opportunities
* Chapter \@ref(broadening): *Broadening your future* encourages you to broaden your horizons. What are the possibilities beyond the obvious?
* Chapter \@ref(speaking): *Speaking your future* looks how can you turn interviews to your advantage and negotiate any offers you receive
* Chapter \@ref(surviving): *Surviving your future* looks at the next steps. Once you've landed a job, how will you survive and thrive outside (and after) University
* Chapter \@ref(achieving): *Achieving your future* looks at evidence you can collect of your learning and development using various kinds of certifiable evidence
* Chapter \@ref(researching): *Researching your future* discusses if a Masters degree or a PhD right for you?

### Supporting your future {#partiii}

The third part of this book, contains supporting material that will help the design, build and test phases described above. You'll need good support to help with the inevitable stresses and strains of building your future as shown in \@ref(fig:clifton-fig)

```{r clifton-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionclifton)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/clifton.png")
```
(ref:captionclifton) Huge supporting chains on the [Clifton Suspension Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton_Suspension_Bridge) in Bristol allow heavy loads pass over the river Avon. You'll need good support to cope with the stresses and strains of building your future. Clifton suspension bridge picture adapted from original by Nic Trott via Wikimedia commons [w.wiki/32tu](https://w.wiki/32tu)

* Chapter \@ref(ruling): *Ruling your future* provides *Ten Simple Rules for Coding your Future*, this book in a nutshell
* Chapter \@ref(hacking): *Hacking your future* invites you to put yourself in the employers shoes by hacking other people's CVs
* Chapter \@ref(moving): *Moving your future* looks at opportunities outside of capital cities like London
* Chapter \@ref(enjoying): *Enjoying your future* provides a soundtrack that might help with your wellbeing
* Chapter \@ref(actioning): *Actioning your future* gets you to think about your actions by emphasising verbs on your job applications
* Chapter \@ref(scheduling): *Scheduling your future* is the live synchronous sessions for this course, if you're not participating in these, schedule a time every day or week for personal development

<!-- creating your future-->
<!--
* algorithms?
* A soundtrack, also available as a Spotify and YouTube playlist
-->

The final part, *Coding your Future*, from chapter \@ref(hearing) gives an overview of the podcast which accompanies this book: *Hearing your Future*. Each subsequent chapter meets a student who is *Coding their Future* and asks, how did they get to where they are and where are they going next? The final chapter \@ref(reading): *Reading your future* lists everything cited in this guidebook.

## Your future themes {#themes}
This guidebook aims to help you build a bridge from where you are now to where you'd like to be in the future. Each chapter of the book contains the following recurring themes:

```{r goldengate-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongoldengate)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/goldengate.png")
```
(ref:captiongoldengate) This guidebook will help you build a bridge to your future.

I'm looking for feedback and contributions on everything in this guidebook from the small things like typos, grammatical errors and spelling mistakes through to bigger issues for each chapter such as:

* Does the chapter make sense, is it clear?
* Does it strike the right tone, is it pitched at the right level? Not patronising? Too many platitudes?
* Are there too many motivational (or [demotivational](https://despair.com/collections/demotivators)) quotations?
* Where is it too long and waffly (see figure \@ref(fig:shorterletter-fig)) or too short?
* Are there too many (or too few) pictures? What needs more illustration?
* Is it well scoped? Too broad or too narrow?
* Are the stated learning objectives met by the chapter?
* Are the activities clear? Can students understand why the activities are recommended? What other activities could be added?
* Will it make sense to global readers e.g. will students from America, China and India etc understand the quirks and idioms of English language and culture
* Are there too many metaphors? Mixed metaphors? Awkward analogies? Idiotic idioms? Annoying alliterations?
* Too many citations? Not enough citations? Missed any key citations?
* What's missing?
* Where are the unstated assumptions? Where is the unconscious bias?
* What are the issues with equality, diversity and inclusion?
* Are there too many musical references or annoying emoji? Please bear in mind I'm trying to strike an irreverent, light-hearted and playful tone to improve readability üòú
* What else should be ruthlessly edited out?

All suggestions welcome! Don't be shy. There are several ways you can contribute, depending on how comfortable you are with Git:

### For git contributors {#techies}

If you're familiar with `git` and `markdown` you can [github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and:

* Raise new issues at [github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/new](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/new)
* Click on the `Edit this page` link, which appears on the bottom right hand side of every page published at [cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me) when viewed with a reasonably large screen (not a phone)
* Contribute at [github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/contribute](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/contribute) and help with existing issues at [github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues)
* Fork the repository, make changes and submit a pull request [github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/pulls](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/pulls). If you need to brush-up on your pulling skills see [makeapullrequest.com](http://makeapullrequest.com/)
* From the command line, clone the repository and submit pull requests from your own setup:
````md
git clone https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf.git
````

Most of the guidebook is generated from [RMarkdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), that's [all the `*.Rmd` files](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/search?l=RMarkdown). So markdown files are the only ones you should edit because everything else is generated from them including the `*.html`, `*.tex`, `*.pdf`,`*.epub` and `*.docx`  files.

### For everyone else {#elseif}

If you don't want to (or can't) use `git` and [github.com](https://github.com/) then you can:

* Add comments by annotating [cdyf.pdf](https://www.cdyf.me/cdyf.pdf) or [cdyf.epub](https://cdyf.me/cdyf.epub) using your personal tablet of choice (iPad, [reMarkable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReMarkable) or whatever) and [emailing your updated version to me](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact)
* Suggest changes by editing the Microsoft Word version at [cdyf.docx](http://cdyf.me/cdyf.docx). The text is all there, but the images are all over the place. This is because the typesetting algorithms in Word aren't anything like as good as the [LaTeX ones](https://latex4year1.netlify.app/) used to create the [cdyf.pdf](https://www.cdyf.me/cdyf.pdf) (output) from the [cdyf.tex](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/blob/master/_book/cdyf.tex) (input).^[Don't say I didn't warn you!] Make sure you've [turned on track changes in Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/track-changes-in-word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a), one of it's [killer features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_feature) that allows your corrections to be easily identified from the original text.
* Just [email me suggestions for improvements](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact)

Any corrections or suggestions will be gratefully received and noted in the acknowledgements section \@ref(thanks), unless you tell me otherwise. I welcome all improvements, big and small.

## Acknowledgements {#thanks}
The content of this book is based on hundreds of conversations I have had with students of (mostly) Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics and Engineering, since 2012. It is also based on conversations I've had with their employers too.

::: {.rmdnote}
(ref:codingcomment)

This acknowledgements section is long because I try to practice what I preach about the importance of expressing gratitude, see section \@ref(lays). It also serves as a live demonstration of a (public) [gratitude journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal). Expressing gratitude, publicly and privately, is a simple and proven technique for improving your mental health. It will also improve the mental health of the people who you thank, and strengthen the communities that you are part of, see \@ref(signposts3).

If you want to get to the main content of this book you can skip this and go straight to chapter \@ref(rebooting).

### Thank you students {#students}
First and foremost, I would like to thank all the students who have helped with this book, both directly and indirectly see figure \@ref(fig:giants-fig).

```{r giants-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongiants)"}

So, if you have studied some flavour of Computer Science at the University of Manchester since 2012, there's a high probability you have contributed to this book. Thank you for having the courage to tell me your stories. Thank you for being ambitious, hard working, talented, fearless, creative, inspirational and listening to me (sometimes). It has been my pleasure and privilege to work with you all.

I'd especially like to thank current and former industrial experience (IE) students who have completed a year in industry as part of their degree as well as those who have done summer internships, either as part of the Master of Engineering (MEng) program or otherwise, particularly [Sami Alabed](https://github.com/samialabed), Luke Beamish, Eirik Bj√∂rnerstedt, [Raluca Cruceru](https://www.cdyf.me/raluca), [Petia Davidova](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDmn8CxaXGxZSKq83vhzULw), [Lloyd Henning](https://github.com/eldog), [Sneha Kandane](https://www.cdyf.me/sneha), [Jason Ozuzu](https://www.cdyf.me/jason), [Carmen Pr√°xedes](https://www.cdyf.me/carmen), Kristina Radinova, [Teodora Stoleru](https://github.com/teostoleru), [Peter Sutton](https://github.com/dj-foxxy) and [Brian Yim Tam](https://www.cdyf.me/brian). In addition, the [PASS leaders](http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk) and facilitators, [UniCSmcr.com](https://unicsmcr.com/), [HackSoc](https://github.com/unicsmcr/hacksoc.com), [CSSoc](https://github.com/cssoc) and [Manchester Ultimate Programming](https://github.com/Man-UP) members have all been influential on the content of this book. I've learned heaps by manually trawling through thousands of your CVs too, so if you've shown me a copy of your CV, thanks! If you sent me a CV and I didn't reply, I apologise. There are limits to what is humanly possible. Chapter \@ref(debugging) on *Debugging your future* (self assessment) and chapter \@ref(hacking) on *Hacking your future* (peer assessment) are based on the most common bugs (or are they features?) I've seen in CVs.

Thanks to Niall Beard and [Sharif Salah](https://github.com/sharifsalah) at Google for introducing me to Google's Technical Writing course in section \@ref(techwriting). Writing is rewriting!

So, thanks employers for employing our students. üôè

### Thank you colleagues {#colleagues}
I've also had significant support from colleagues in the Department of Computer Science  ([\@csmcr](https://twitter.com/csmcr)), and many other parts of the University: (engineering, natural sciences, social sciences, biology, medicine and health etc) and support staff at the University of Manchester. ([\@UoMCareers](https://twitter.com/UoMCareers), [\@alumniUoM](https://twitter.com/alumniUoM), [\@OfficialUoM](https://twitter.com/OfficialUoM))

Thank you [Carole Goble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Goble) for building the community that supported me through postgraduate study. Thanks for creating the environment which this book was written in, especially the [e-Science lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/), Information Management Group (IMG), Software Sustainability Institute ([software.ac.uk](https://software.ac.uk/)) and their spin-offs. Thanks for patiently re-teaching me how to write better by covering early drafts of my Masters thesis in red ink and less patiently (on subsequent revisions) swear words. ü§¨

Thank you [Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber) for playing guitar in our ‚Äúboy band‚Äù [Tuning Complete](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/research#tuningcomplete). All we've got is your bass guitar, [three chords and the truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Chords_and_the_Truth). [@harlan; @allalongthewatchtower] üé∏

Thank you [Jim Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_John_Miles) for encouraging me to write a book shortly after you offered me a job. I thought you were joking (about the book) but it actually turned out to be another one of your great ideas. Thanks Jim. üôè

I'd also like to thank the only three people in the whole world who've had the ~~misfortune~~ pleasure of reading all of my PhD thesis cover to cover; [Robert Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_David_Stevens), [Anil Wipat](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/anilwipat.html) and [Steve Pettifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Pettifer). I suspect it was as painful for you to read as it was for me to write it. Thanks Robert for your relentless patience and giving me a well timed, well aimed kick up the (proverbial) arse to write this book in the [Midland Hotel, Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Hotel,_Manchester) at the May ball.

So, thank you colleagues for being collegiate. You make the University of Manchester an enjoyable place to work.

Thanks to Rebecca Dann, Michael Doody, Keith Doran and other members of the [alternative (Elizabethan) staff room](https://www.elizabethanstockport.co.uk/) for your emotional, moral and practical support throughout a challenging year fuelled by my [midlife crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlife_crisis). According to the *Manchester Evening News*, St. Anne's is ‚Äúthe forgotten school‚Äù [@stannes1; @stannes2], see figure \@ref(fig:st-annes-fig), but I'll never forget you or the lessons you taught me.

knitr::include_graphics("images/st-annes-rc-high-school.jpg")
```

(ref:captionstannes) Good governance is crucial to good schools. Many forgotten schools like [St. Anne's R.C. High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Anne%27s_RC_Voluntary_Academy), and the thousands of children in the UK they educate every year, need help from skilled people like you on their governing boards. Why not serve your local community as a ‚Äú[critical friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_friend)‚Äù on the governing board of a school? All ages are welcome, but especially younger governors, see [where are all the young school governors?](https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/mar/11/young-people-school-governors) [@youngovernors] Take a look at [governorsforschools.org.uk](https://governorsforschools.org.uk/).

### Thank you githubbers {#github}

Thanks to everyone who has contributed via github, listed below in order of github usernames. I will credit *any* github contributors here, small or large. Even the typos, it all counts. I don't care what operating system you are using either, see figure \@ref(fig:sticky-comics-fig). You can easily add yourself to this roll call (see section \@ref(contributing)) by correcting my delibreate mitsakes. üòâ

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

### Thank you Bryan {#visualthinkery}
Many of the illustrations for this book have been drawn by the very talented Bryan Mathers [\@BryanMMathers](https://twitter.com/BryanMMathers/) shown in figure \@ref(fig:tedx-galway-fig).

Bryan is an artist, visual thinker, entrepreneur and listener who turns stories into pictures. He also happens to have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Glasgow. As a renaissance man, his combined skills in art, science and engineering made him the perfect fit for illustrating this guidebook. You can find out more about Bryan at [bryanmathers.com](https://bryanmmathers.com) and [visualthinkery.com](https://visualthinkery.com). I'm *sooo* glad we randomly bumped into each other at the #wikiedu20 conference: [wikiedusummit.coventry.domains](https://wikiedusummit.coventry.domains/).

```{r tedx-galway-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongalway)"}

### Thank you Fitzmaurice {#fitzmaurice}  
Thanks to my [Fitzmaurice Primary School](https://www.fitzmauriceschool.info/) school teachers: Mrs Cripps, Miss Clarry, Morris Clay, Neil Fleming, Mr Jackson, [Betty Knowles](https://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/announcements/deaths/deaths/18007859.Betty_Knowles/), Mr. Lucas, [Valerie Payne](https://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/announcements/deaths/deaths/18937250.Valerie_Payne/), Miss Sheldon, [Hugh Solomon](https://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/announcements/deaths/deaths/9828233.Hugh_Solomon/), Miss Uncles and Mrs White. I used to foolishly think it was secondary schools that did all the serious teaching, but they'd be *nowhere* without the crucial foundations laid in primary school. It takes a whole community (a village) to raise a child and a lot of that starts in primary school, see figure \@ref(fig:clinton-fig).

### Thank you NHS {#thxnhs}

[Thank you NHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_You_NHS) for all the healthcare you've provided for me and my family from our cradles to our graves, see figure \@ref(fig:nhs-fig).

Like many people, my path has been a bit of an [Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey) or what [Helen Tupper](https://twitter.com/HelenTupper) and Sarah Ellis call a ‚Äú[squiggly career](https://www.amazingif.com/books/)‚Äù. [@squigglybook] It's highly likely that, like me, your career will not follow a neat linear trajectory either. [@squigglytalk]

Beyond the paid stuff, I've done a range of voluntary work too, serving as a competition judge, fundraiser, [code club](https://codeclub.org) \& [coderdojo](https://coderdojo.com) leader, rabble rouser, [digital council](https://www.manchesterdigital.com/) member, [school governor](https://governorsforschools.org.uk/), curator, librarian, beer drinker, [wikipedia trainer](https://wiki-loves-scientists.org.uk/), [journal clubber](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) and editor. But as [Ronnie Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Lane) and [Ronnie Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Wood) (figure \@ref(fig:faces-fig)) once said, I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger.

```{r faces-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfaces)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/faces.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionfaces) Hindsight is a great teacher. Poor old grandad I laughed at all his words but I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger, see [Ooh La La](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_La_La_(Faces_song)) [@faces] I've written some of what I know now in this guidebook, I hope you find it useful.

This guidebook documents some of what I know now, that I wish I'd known, when I was younger. If you're starting your career, I hope you find these insights and exercises useful. I've sat on both sides of many interview tables, as interviewer and interviewee. I have had some spectacular failures, alongside some modest successes, and have included personal stories where they are relevant.

Most of what I have learned about employment comes from listening to, and watching students interact with employers as they take the first tentative steps in their careers. I've documented some of what they taught me, so reading this book may help you learn from some of their successes and failures.

## Legal stuff {#legal}

I am not a lawyer ([IANAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL)) but any opinions expressed in this guidebook are my own and not representative of my current employer, the University of Manchester. This guidebook does not therefore, represent University policy.

# (PART) DESIGNING {-}

# Rebooting your future {#rebooting}

The first part of this book is about *designing* your future. Before we get started, we need to reboot and tackle a fundamental design issue. Why the hell would you want to bother reading this guidebook when you have so many other things to do right now?

 * ‚úÖ  You are a busy person, YES!
 * ‚úÖ  Your time is a precious and finite resource, YES!
 * ‚úÖ  You could be spending that precious time right now in lots of other ways, YES!
 * ‚úÖ  There are mountains of self-help guides and courses already, YES!
 * ‚úÖ  Do you really need *yet another* guidebook? YES!

You should read this guidebook because it is different to all the other guidebooks! It will help you design, test, build, debug and `code` your future in computing.

Before you start coding, we need to reboot. Come with me down the rabbit hole in figure \@ref(fig:rabbit-fig) and let me explain... üêá

```{r rabbit-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionrabbit)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Rabbit-hole.png")
```

(ref:captionrabbit) Shall we go down the rabbit hole? [Rabbit Hole learning](https://bryanmmathers.com/rabbit-hole-learning/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

## What you will learn {#ilo1}
After reading this chapter you will be able to reboot your future by :

1. Setting your expectations for using this guidebook, and open some doors to your future
1. Travelling down the rabbit hole into the underworld of employment
1. Discussing some of the gaps that exist between formal education and employment and how you can bridge them

## Let's go down the rabbit hole {#wonderland}

In the novel *[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)* [@wonderland], the protagonist Alice follows a [white rabbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rabbit) down a hole. What she discovers is a strange underground world populated by weird and wonderful characters. The world of work can sometimes be a mysterious underworld where you adventure in wonderland accompanied by colourful characters.

You will spend lots of time in this wonderland, potentially as much as 80,000 hours of your life. [@iip1; @iip2] So join me down the rabbit hole, it's fun (honest), and sooner or later you'll have to come down here anyway. So open up the door to the new possibilities in your future.

## Opening your future {#opening}
Studying at University opens new doors to your future, some of which will take you down rabbit holes. As the poet [Lemn Sissay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemn_Sissay) puts it (figure \@ref(fig:lemn-fig)):

```{r lemn-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionlemn)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lemninspire.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionlemn) Open all doors, open all senses, open all defences, ask: What were these closed for? From *Inspire and be Inspired* by [Lemn Sissay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemn_Sissay) whose poetry is even better when you hear it, rather than just read it [youtu.be/WzZs1w3NWzg](https://youtu.be/WzZs1w3NWzg). [@sissay] Portrait of Sissay speaking in 2010 by Philosophy Football via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3VYT](https://w.wiki/3VYT) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

## Maximising your future {#roi}
As well as opening your future, studying at University is about *investing* in your future. You're spending lots of your time and money at University. Hopefully, you've picked a subject that stimulates and challenges you intellectually while allowing you to find and develop your unique talents. But there's another reason that you probably chose to study at University and that was to improve your job prospects. This guidebook will:

1. Help you maximise the [return on investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment) (ROI) of the substantial amount of your time and money you have already put into your education, from high school through to University
1. Give you an overview of important professional issues that are sometimes neglected or sidelined in school and University curricula
1. Highlight and review essential resources beyond this guidebook that will help with the above

All of the resources that can help you are scattered around in lots of different places. There are books, there are videos, there are podcasts, there are websites and jobs boards. There are online courses, blogs, social media, newspaper columns, journal articles, marketing material and many other good resources. It is overwhelming.

## Your future is your responsibility {#responsibility}
When Andy Stanford-Clark started working at IBM, fresh out of University, his manager gave him the career advice shown in figure \@ref(fig:andysc-fig):

```{r andysc-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionandysc)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nobody-cares-about-your-career-except-you.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionandysc) Nobody cares about your career except you. Quote via [Andy Stanford-Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Stanford-Clark) [@andystanfordclark] to an unattributed IBM manager. Image of Andy by Gizmo~enwiki via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3TSn](https://w.wiki/3TSn) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238) Thank you Andy for permission to use your photo.

Andy is now Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and [IBM Master inventor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Master_Inventor) in the UK so it was probably good advice. Another, slightly more positive way of putting the advice is, the person who cares *most* about your career is you. So while there are people who can help design and build your future, ultimately it is **YOU** who has to take responsibility for the implementation (if you like, the `code`). The sooner you get coding the better.

At University, there are lots of people can help design and build your future: peers, friends, academic staff, your careers service, employers and your wider social and professional networks but ultimately it is *your* responsibility to sort out whatever comes next. That might sound obvious but don't wait for somebody else to do it for you, because it probably won't happen.

## Your degree is not enough {#entitled}
<!--Luke comments: One thing I would add in this section that you don't really think about until you go through it is the difference between going for a CS job and that job you really want. Most grads will get a job in CS, but few will get those really prized ones that they really enjoy.-->
You have worked hard to get the grades you needed to get into University. You've spent (or are spending) a significant amount of time and money studying your chosen discipline. You are really *geeking out* by going deep into your subject for a substantial period of time. Geekery, by which I mean [being interested in a subject for its own sake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek), is a *good* thing. Earning the title *geek* is a compliment, not an insult, and you should wear your geek badge with [geek pride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Pride_Day)! The weirdness flows between us, anyone can tell to see us. [@freakscene] Some people even say the geeks will inherit the earth, see figure \@ref(fig:geekout-fig). You are a geek, so where is *your* inheritance?

```{r geekout-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongeekout)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/blessed-are-the-geeks.jpeg")
```
(ref:captiongeekout) [Blessed are the ~~meek~~ geeks, for they shall inherit the earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_5:5). [@inherit; @blessed] You are a geek, so where is your inheritance? Image of stained glass window by Norbert Schnitzler via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/43LN](https://w.wiki/43LN) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

As a studious geek you might be tempted to believe that the world owes you something in return for all your geekiness. Unfortunately that's not the case.

At some point during or after your study, you might find yourself applying for a graduate job or graduate scheme. EVERYONE applying for these opportunities will have a degree or be rapidly on their way to getting one. So having a degree, even a really geeky one, isn't going to set you apart much from your competition. Even having a first class degree may not distinguish you that much your competitors [@gradeinflation; @firstclass]. Some employers would rather not know (or don't care) what University you went to, so your education might not make you stand out as much as you might like anyway. [@bigfour; @eyfirm]

<!--Reducing the Stress of Perfectionism
Perfectionism has a way of robbing us of that glow of achievement and ultimately making us miserable. Having high standards is good but not if they make everything in life so challenging that we are exhausted before we have even started!

If you find that you are never really satisfied with your achievements, spend a lot of time procrastinating rather than working and are increasingly self-critical, then this could be the workshop for you. You will learn:

* About the psychology of the perfectionist
* how perfectionism becomes self-defeating.
* ways of challenging the rigid perfectionist mindset

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180219-toxic-perfectionism-is-on-the-rise
-->

What **WILL** distinguish you from your competitors is:


* your `experience`: see chapter \@ref(experiencing)
* your `projects`: see section \@ref(mycvpj)
* your communication skills:
    - Writing: see chapter \@ref(writing)
    - Speaking: see chapter \@ref(speaking)
    - Listening: see chapter \@ref(hearing)
    - Reading: see chapter \@ref(reading)
* your actions: what have you **done** with all of the above? See chapter \@ref(actioning)
* your `results` and `evidence`: see `C.A.R.E` in section \@ref(care): context, action, results and evidence. We're talking about all your results, not just exam results.
* any `leadership or awards` you can demonstrate or that you have picked up along the way, see section \@ref(prizes)

If you think that your degree will be enough to get you the job you want, bear in mind that:

<!--Some employers are agnostic to where your degree came from, or how you did at high school, to your academic credentials
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/ey-firm-says-it-will-not-longer-consider-degrees-or-a-level-results-when-assessing-employees-10436355.html
-->

1. There are more and more graduates, the UK for example recently passed the milestone of 50% of young people going into higher education. This compares to just 15% of over 18s who stayed in higher education in 1980 [@lotsofgrads]
1. While a degree is a *necessary* condition for joining a graduate scheme or taking a graduate job it is [not a *sufficient* condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_and_sufficiency). Having a degree will not set you apart much from your competition, every applicant will have a Bachelors degree. <!--used to be grad scheme growth slower than increase in grad but this is possibly a myth -->
1. There are lots of graduates in your discipline. In the UK, for example, around 9,000 students graduate every year in Computer Science. If you're studying in the UK, what makes you different from the other 8,999 computer scientists graduating in your year?


```{r lotsofgrads-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionlotsofgrads)"}
library(ggplot2)
lotsofgrads <- tribble(
  ~year,         ~percentage,
  "1980",       15,
  "1990",       25,
  "2018",       50
)

ggplot(data = lotsofgrads) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percentage), stat = "identity")
```
(ref:captionlotsofgrads) Percentage of young people in the UK going into higher education between 1980 and 2018. Over the last forty years, the proportion of young people going into higher education has more than doubled from 15% in 1980 to over 50% in 2018. Data taken from BBC news article on [the symbolic target of 50% at university reached](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-49841620) [@lotsofgrads]

As [Sally Fincher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Fincher) puts it:

> Computing is one of the largest subject areas in UK higher education, and is taught in almost every institution, graduating around 9,000 students every year
> `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Sally Fincher [@fincherreview]')`

Now, don't be disillusioned by the statistics because any degree can open doors to many careers in computing. Studying *computing* opens up plenty of doors, see figure \@ref(fig:nurses-fig). According to [Charlie Ball](https://twitter.com/lmicharlie), it is a myth that there aren't enough graduate jobs; one of four myths in the UK about the graduate labour market:

* **Myth 1:** *Everyone goes to university nowadays* : ~50% isn't everyone [@ballmyths]
* **Myth 2:** *There aren‚Äôt enough graduate jobs* [@ballmyths]
* **Myth 3:** *Some degrees have little value to employers*, see chapter \@ref(computing)
* **Myth 4:** *All the best graduate jobs are in London*, (or your local big city) see chapter \@ref(moving)

```{r eval=knitr::is_html_output(excludes = "epub"), gsoc-tweet-fig, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "test caption"}
library(tweetrmd)
include_tweet("https://twitter.com/UniversitiesUK/status/1513439211059306497")
```

What the data in figure \@ref(fig:lotsofgrads-fig) show is that you'll need to look **beyond** your formal education to distinguish yourself from your competition. Your degree can certainly help you start a career, and computer geekery is a commercially valuable skill but a degree (however geeky) is typically not enough by itself.

There's plenty of graduate jobs for you to apply for, but that doesn't mean its going to be easy to walk into one when you graduate. Employers are looking for more from their employees than just *having* a degree, see chapter \@ref(experiencing).

## It's too late when you graduate {#thisstuffmatters}

You might be tempted to postpone making difficult career decisions:

* I'll do it tomorrow ...
* I'll do it next week ...
* I'll do it next year ...
* I'll finish this assignment ...
* I'll finish this exam ...
* I'll finish this semester ...
* I'll finish my degree first, see figure \@ref(fig:procrastination-fig) ...

Procrastination is a part of the [human condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition). Software engineer [Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)) calls this [good and bad procrastination](http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html) [@procrastination].

```{r procrastination-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionprocrastination)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/procrastinator.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionprocrastination) [Procrastination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination): the attitude of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get my degree out of the way first then worry about jobs and careers when I finish University‚Äù is bad procrastination. It's too late when you graduate to start thinking about what might come next [@procrastination] Stresssed procrastinator picture by MismibaTinasheMadando on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3TXo](https://w.wiki/3TXo)

Postponing decisions about your career is usually bad procrastination. It probably doesn't help that many of issues described and discussed in this book are typically not closely integrated into the curriculum in Higher Education. You'll often find them on the edges, or completely outside of, standard University curricula.

<!--Broadly speaking, the professional issues described in this book are usually covered by

* pastoral support systems
* counselling services
* careers services
* trade organisations
* professional bodies
* student unions and their societies.-->

Despite being sidelined, these issues matter and it is in your own self interests to start thinking about them right now. According to recent estimates by *Investors in People*, the average person spends **80,000 hours** working during their lifetime. [@iip2] So, *whatever* you end up doing after University, you'll be spending a lot of time doing it. Difficult decisions often get sidelined but it is never too early to start thinking about them and doing something.

If you want to work for a big name like those in section \@ref(bignames) or \@ref(studentjobs), many of the larger graduate employers expect you to have *some* experience (see chapter \@ref(experiencing)) *before* you graduate. A large chunk of vacancies on graduate schemes are filled people who have already been employed as interns or placement students within that (or another) organisation. So the sooner you start investigating employers by getting some experience the better decisions you'll be able to make about what comes next. It's (usually) too late when you graduate.

That doesn't mean you have to know EXACTLY what you want to do when you finish. Lots of students don't and I certainly didn't when I graduated. I'd done a gap year teaching in India, two summer internships (in Sweden and the United States) and a year-in-industry in the UK and I *still* graduated with **no clue** as to what I wanted to do next! The important thing is that you make a start, and sometimes knowing what you **don't** want to do is just as valuable as knowing what you *DO* want to do.

Computer scientists call this problem ‚Äúsearch space reduction‚Äù, [@searchspace] because you have a [feasible region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region) of future possibilities and you need to narrow down the candidates. You could think of coding your future as an [optimisation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem). Start optimising now because it's too late when you graduate. üéì


## Yes, this WILL be on the exam {#exams}

Students love to ask their teachers ‚Äú*will this be on the exam*‚Äù? The short answer is **YES** (and **NO**)! Yes, this will be on the exam, but NO the exam won't be set by your University. Unlike other courses you've done, the examinations for this course aren't set by your University but by employers.  Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of examinations that you'll need to get good at, shown in Table \@ref(tab:examtable)

:  (\#tab:examtable) Examining your future: The "exams" used by employers, what gets assessed and the grades you can get. For written "exams" see chapters \@ref(writing) and \@ref(debugging), for speaking "exams" see chapter \@ref(speaking) and for your employee "exams" see chapter \@ref(surviving).

+---------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
| Examination         | What examiners are assessing               | Grade    |
+=====================+============================================+==========+
| CV, application form| - Should we invite you to interview ?      | pass/fail|
| covering letter     | - Can you communicate well in writing?     |          |
|                     | - Do you have any experience?              |          |
|                     | - What interesting projects have you done? |          |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
| Interview           | - Should we offer you a job?               | pass/fail|
|                     | - Would we want you on our team?           |          |
|                     | - Can you communicate well verbally?       |          |
|                     | - Can you communicate well nonverbally?    |          |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
| Employee performance| - Should we promote you?                   | pass/fail|
|                     | - Should we give you a pay rise?           |          |
|                     | - Should we extend your contract?          |          |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+


So, *yes*, this will be on the exam, but *no*, the exams are obviously not set, administered, invigilated and marked by academics at your University. The exams are set by employers and the results are **brutally binary**:

* **PASS**: you've got the interview, job or promotion or...
* **FAIL**: none of the above. Next!

One of the challenging things about employers exams are, they typically do not have the bandwidth to give applicants useful feedback, other than a simple pass or fail. When it comes to job applications software engineer [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell) calls this the "black hole". The gravitational force of employers black holes is so strong that no CV or R√©sum√© can escape, we'll say more about this in chapter \@ref(debugging) on debugging your future.

(ref:captiongimme) So *no* this will not be on the exam set by University, but *yes* it will be on the exams set by employers. Some of the most important exams you sit at (and after) University are set by employers. This guidebook will help you prepare for those exams and increase your chances of passing them.

It's a similar story with interviews, if you fluffed an interview question or came across badly, it can be really difficult to find out from the employer what you did wrong. That makes it harder to learn from your mistakes.

## Practicing your future {#activities}
There are practical exercises, for you to get your hands dirty with. Each chapter incorporates activities including individual exercises, group exercises, quizzes and points for wider discussion. You'll get a lot more out of this guidebook by doing the activities, rather than just reading it.

## Navigating your future {#relatedwork}

There are **lots** of resources out there that offer self-help, career advice and techniques for self-improvement. It can be hard to know where to start, or even how to find your way around the mountains of advice.

```{r shelfie-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionshelfie)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/shelfie.jpg")
```
(ref:captionshelfie) There are tonnes of resources out there offering advice on a huge range of professional issues. You can't read them all, but this guide aims to help you navigate the resources that will be most use to you

Lots of professional advice is readily available, but how will you navigate it? This book signposts you to what I think are the most important resources, each chapter has a signposts section, and they are all gathered together in the signpost at the end alongside everything (yes, EVERYTHING!) that this guidebook cites in the references, chapter \@ref(reading).

## Crediting your future {#crediting}

## Your future is different {#thinkdifferent}

I'm writing this guidebook because I need a resource for students to help them design, build, test and code their futures in computing. I need a book to help me teach to students to compete for jobs while at University, or shortly after graduating. I can't find anything suitable that meets all the requirements of the students I teach. Some problems with the resources that are already out there, and how this book addresses them, are shown in table \@ref(tab:difftable)

<!--Good though these many resources are, they all have their own limitations.

Some resources only tackle a single issue, while many can't easily be adapted for your own needs. -->

<!--Others neglect the student voice or fail to tell the story of students with first-hand experience of a rapidly changing and sometimes brutally competitive job market. Many are written from the point of view of employers, recruiters or careers advisors [@samfranklin]. These people all have valuable advice for students but they often lack first hand experience of working in a given sector and in some cases are trying sell you something! Another common shortcoming is excluding all parts of the story which combine four overlapping perspectives:

1. Students and recent graduates
1. Employers and recruiters
1. Careers advisors, authors and journalists
1. Scientists and engineers, in industry and academia-->

<!--This book aims to combine these perspectives and to be different from existing resources in the following ways:-->

### Your future is signposted {#signposted}
Some career resources claim (or imply) that they are the *all you will need* to solve a particular problem or worse: solve *all of your problems*! Just buy this book, do this course, watch this video, listen to this podcast and all your problems will go away!  Rather than continue this trend, this book **signposts** some of the most useful resources, see figure \@ref(fig:signposting-fig).

```{r signposting-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionsignposting)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/signposting.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionsignposting) Wondering which way to go at the [traffic sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_sign)? I've signposted the resources that will help you navigate the start of your professional journey. Which route will you take? Picture of a signpost in the [√Öland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85land_Islands), Finland by Sal via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3Xop](https://w.wiki/3Xop) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Scientists call signposting **citation**, so I've signposted and cited sources in this guidebook so that you can :

1. Follow them if the destinations are interesting or useful
1. Check and verify any facts and claims I make in this book for yourself

While this guidebook cites lots of resources, some of them are more important than others. Each chapter summarises these in a signposts section. You'll find everything else in the references, chapter \@ref(reading). University and public libraries may also have physical and electronic copies of some of the books listed here.

<!--If you're studying at the University of Manchester, these signposts are available as a library reading list at [library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/reading-lists](https://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/reading-lists).-->

I'm not suggesting that you read *all* these books right now, but that if a particular chapter has piqued your interest, these signposts are good places to keep going, if you haven't already read them. I hope you'll find these signposts handy for navigating the mountains of advice. Not all who wander are lost. üó∫Ô∏èüß≠

### Your future is guided  {#study}
This guidebook to your future accompanies a course that has been co-designed by students for students, with input from academics and employers. It unites several disparate themes into one coherent story, from fundamental questions about identity and wellbeing through to more applied and practical advice on job hunting, career progression and life after University. Resources that do this are typically scattered around in many different places. There is usually no narrative to tie them all together to help students navigate the mountains of advice as they embark on the first stages of their careers. I'll guide you through the narrative, but it is a *descriptive* story rather than a *prescriptive* one, see figure \@ref(fig:descriptive-fig).

```{r descriptive-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiondescriptive)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/prescriptive-vs-descriptive-pathways.png")
```

(ref:captiondescriptive) Many formal education courses follow a *prescriptive pathway* (right), they lead you through a story from start to finish. This is the way of the University: ‚Äú`our courses`‚Äù - our prospectus. This course is different, it follows a *descriptive pathway* (left) which means you pick your own way through the story. I'll guide you through the story but you'll need to choose *your* way: ‚Äú`my way`‚Äù. Do it [your way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Way).

Although this is a course guidebook used in undergraduate teaching, you don't need to be enrolled on the course to benefit from reading it, watching the videos and doing the exercises and coding challenges.

### Your future is constantly updated {#version}
You are reading the alpha version, the [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP) of this guidebook, last updated on `r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`. That's software engineer talk for saying *it isn't finished yet*. Subsequent versions, will be continuously and iteratively released on a daily and weekly basis. They will include:

* More quizzes for better interactivity
* More videos on the [Coding your Future YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLBv_u8JmyUPqmRALIjVnLg)
* Audio interviews with Students in the *Coding your Future podcast* in chapter \@ref(hearing)
* More illustrations throughout the book
* Improved content, finish incomplete chapters
* Fix bugs and typos
* Your suggestions for improvements and corrections, via github etc see section \@ref(contributing)

I'm taking a [release early, release often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often) [@Raymond1999] approach to publishing this guidebook, you could call it agile book development or [continuous book delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery), see figure \@ref(fig:agile-vs-waterfall-fig) [@realagile]

### Your future is personal {#firstperson}
A lot of scientific and technical writing is written in the third person or passive voice, which is fine for academic writing, but can alienate readers. I have opted to use first person narrative where possible as it is shorter, and hopefully more engaging for you to read. [@googler] Where relevant, I've told personal stories to illustrate key points.

### Your future has no paywall {#openaccess}
You don't need to pay anything to read this book online because its not hiding behind a [paywall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall), see section \@ref(license). Publishing this guidebook online makes it findable and accessible, something that isn't true of knowledge locked up inside other books.

Because this guidebook is online, it is searchable, browsable and linkable. You can link to whatever level you like, top level, chapter level and to every section and subsection level. Everything important has a Uniform Resource Locator ([URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL)).

<!--###
The FAIR principles have been followed in writing this book.[@FAIR] not really interoperable or reusable?

They're not ready yet-->

### Your future has no login {#nologin}
You don't need to login to anything to use this guidebook either. Hurrah! One less password to remember.

### Your future has audio & video {#av}
This book is not just words and pictures, but includes audio and video as well, especially:

1. videos produced by third parties that are worth watching
1. audio produced by third parties that are worth listening to, either individual episodes or whole series
1. short videos produced by me, which augment the written content of this book, see the [Coding your Future YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLBv_u8JmyUPqmRALIjVnLg)
1. the *coding your future* podcast which interviews undergraduate students, see chapter \@ref(hearing)

## Engaging with your future {#engage}
I've tried to make the content of this book as engaging as possible by including pictures and conversations. *Your future* is deliberately playful and light-hearted. If you think this guidebook can be improved, let me know via the mechanisms described in section \@ref(contributing). I always welcome constructive feedback, especially when it comes via a pull request. Engage, see figure \@ref(fig:startrek-fig).

Make it so.

## Signposting your future {#sign1}

Each chapter in this book has a signposts section, highlighting key reading, watching or listening you could do next. This chapter has addressed the question of **why should you bother coding your future**? The answer is that your future is your responsibility and no-one elses. There are lots of people can help shape your future, but none more than yourself. Software engineer [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) argues this point in his book *The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers*. [@cleancoder]

What's good about *The Clean Coder* is that it is short (only 200 pages), well written and to the point. The main part of the book covers professional issues in software engineering, some of which I discuss further in chapter \@ref(surviving), *surviving your future*.


## Summarising your future {#tldr1}

If all that was [too long, didn't read](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read) (TL;DR) for you, then you'll be relieved to hear that each chapter has a TL;DR (executive) summary.

```{r tldr-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiontldr)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tldr.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiontldr) There's always more stuff you should be [reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading). If this guidebook is a bit **Too Long, Didn't Read** (TL;DR) then each chapter has a brief summary at the end. Public domain picture of ancient [greek muse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muses) reading a scroll (that's probably too long) via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3Xoh](https://w.wiki/3Xoh) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238) üá¨üá∑

The TL;DR for this chapter is, you should read this guidebook because it is different to all the other guidebooks. It will help you take responsibility for maximising your future. No-one else is going to do this for you. Your degree will help open up future options, but it is not enough by itself so you'll need to maximise the return on your investment. Don't procrastinate because it's too late when you graduate and *YES* this will be on the exam (set by future employers). This guidebook has signposts to help you navigate, design, build, test, debug and code your future in computing.

It looks like the reboot has finished, so we're ready to go. In the next chapter, you will reflect on who you are. What's your story, coding glory?

# Knowing your future {#knowing}

Hello, who are you? What's your story, coding glory? What are you good at, what do you like doing and what do you value? What are your hopes and dreams for the future? Tell me about your education and who you are. What unique talents are you finding and developing during your education? How are you striving to become the best possible version of you? Having good self knowledge will help you answer these big questions, which are important for your future. Knowing your future depends on knowing who you are now. üèÜ

(ref:captionwhoareyou) Your education is a crucial part of your story and who you are. The purpose of your education is not *just* to get you a job but to also find and develop your unique talents. What are your unique talents? How are you developing them as part of your broader education?

## What you will learn {#ilo2}

Reading this chapter and doing the activities will help you to

1. Develop better self-awareness by experimenting with seven techniques for exploring your identity:
    + Protected characteristics: see sections \@ref(protected) and \@ref(genderid)
    + What's your story, coding glory? See section \@ref(story)
    + Head, heart and hands: see section \@ref(hhh)
    + Ikigai: reason for being. See section \@ref(no42)
    + Personality profiling, see section \@ref(personality)
    + Privilege audit, see section \@ref(apriv)
    + Deathbed thought experiment, see section \@ref(regrets)
1. Know yourself better so that you can:
    + start coding your future
    + articulate who you are to potential employers

## Improving self-awareness {#skynet}
Knowing who you are now, will help you explore and understand who you might become in the future. That future you is the *best possible version of you* shown in \@ref(fig:goal-fig). Education allows you to explore those versions of your identity but only a fraction of your education will happen during lectures, labs, tutorials and seminars see figure \@ref(fig:stephen-fry-lecture-fig)

```{r stephen-fry-lecture-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfrylecture)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fry-lecture.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionfrylecture) According to [Stephen Fry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fry), Education is the sum of what students teach each other in between lectures and seminars. [@frychronicles] Fry is referring to studying humanities rather than science or engineering, but makes an important point about education. At University you will learn as much from your peers via [peer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_learning), [peer instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_instruction), [peer support](http://www.peersupport.manchester.ac.uk/) and [informal learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_learning) as you will from your professors. Public domain portrait of Fry at Winfield House in 2016 by the US Embassy in London [w.wiki/4wrn](https://w.wiki/4wrn)

Your identity, who you are, is complex, dynamic and high-dimensional so you need to use different techniques to develop better self-awareness.

### Your protected characteristics {#protected}
Some of your identity includes characteristics that are protected. In the UK, the Equality Act of 2010^[\url{http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents}] protects you from discrimination at work or in education, based on what are known as "protected characteristics". [@equality]. This means that:

* Your **age** should not determine how you are treated
* Your **disabilities** should not determine how you are treated
* Your **gender** should not determine how you are treated [@inferior; @damore; @damoreguardian; @everydaysexism]
* Your **gender re-assignment** should not determine how you are treated
* Your **marriage** or civil partnership should not determine how you are treated
* Your **pregnancy** and maternity should not determine how you are treated
* Your **race** (including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin) should not determine how you are treated [@nottalking; @superior]
* Your **religion** or beliefs should not determine how you are treated
* Your **sex** should not determine how you are treated [@harassment]
* Your **sexual orientation** should not determine how you are treated [@nosex]

These are an important part of your identity you are familiar with, but take note, these parts of your identity are special because they are protected.

### Gender {#genderid}

Gender is something many people *believe* they understand, but most people actually don't. One way to understand gender better is to break it down into four characteristics:

1. **Identity**: your gender identity
1. **Expression**: your gender expression
1. **Sex**: your biological sex
1. **Attraction**: your sexual and romantic orientation

These protected characteristics are often conflated, because people tend to confuse gender, sex and sexual orientation. They are *not* the same thing as shown in equation \@ref(eq:gender)

::: {.rmdnote}

\begin{equation}
Identity ‚â† Expression ‚â† Sex ‚â† Attraction
  (\#eq:gender)
\end{equation}

:::

Lets have a look at each of those in turn:

1. **Identity** üß† is who you know yourself to be in your own head. Gender identity is based on how much you align (or don‚Äôt align) with the options for gender based on your psychological sense of self. This includes, but is not limited to:
    + `Woman | Genderqueer | Man` see [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary) and [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender)
1. **Expression** üé® is how you demonstrate your gender based on gender roles through the ways that you act, dress, behave and interact. These are not exclusive categories, you might choose to express yourself in all three ways including:
    + `Feminine | Androgynous | Masculine` see [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression)
1. **Sex** ‚ößÔ∏è is often conflated with gender. Sometimes called anatomical sex or physical sex, your biological sex is objectively measurable using features such as your genitalia, [chromosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome) (your [sex-determination system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-determination_system) `XX`, `XY` etc), hormones, body hair, ovaries and testes. Your biological sex includes, but is not limited to:
    + `Female | Intersex | Male` see [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex)
1. **Attraction** ‚ù§Ô∏è is who you are physically, spiritually and emotionally attracted to. Like biological sex, sexual orientation is often conflated with gender but isn‚Äôt always a component of gender. We categorise the attraction we experience in gendered ways. Your sexual orientation includes, but is not limited to:
    + `Asexual | Heterosexual | Bisexual | Homosexual` see [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation) and [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)) and [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality)

These characteristics are summarised in the genderbread person shown in figure \@ref(fig:genderbread-fig)

```{r genderbread-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongenderbread)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Genderbread-Person-v4.png")
```

Gender is probably more complicated than you realised, but the framework above will help you understand it better or help you explain the subtleties to someone else  by breaking a complicated concept into bite-sized, digestible pieces.

### What's your story, coding glory? {#story}
The protected characteristics described above are the part of your story you'll be most aware of. But there's much more to your story than these characteristics. We're hardwired to love storytelling because it help us understand our world, see figure \@ref(fig:storytelling-fig). We use stories to organise and communicate, so knowing your story is a crucial part of knowing who you are. What's your story, coding glory? [@whatsthestory]

```
(ref:captionstorytelling) [Storytelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling) is an ancient art and who doesn't love a good story?

Public domain image of a painting by John Everett Millais, with a seafarer telling the story of what happened out at sea, via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3VHM](https://w.wiki/3VHM)

Self-awareness, understanding who you are, is important for leading a healthy and happy life, and likely to be an important factor in your future success. One way to develop better self-awareness is to think about the finer details of your story. [@freeyourstory] How did you get here, where are you going, what has inspired you? Who is the authentic you? [@regrets] What are your hopes and dreams? By starting to answer these questions you will gain a better understanding of who you are. This includes strengths, weaknesses, motivation and values. [@parachute2020]

Your story is probably complex but you need to know it so you can distill the details of it into *much* shorter stories on your job applications described in section \@ref(mycvst). Things to think about are:

* Characters: who are the key people in your story so far?
* Settings: where have your stories taken place?
* Action, conflict and change : what has changed you and how?
* Emotions: how did you feel at the time, sad, happy, excited?

<!--Universities offer many opportunities for self improvement, self discovery and developing your unique skills.-->

### Head, heart, hands {#hhh}

Another technique for building your self-awareness is to reflect on your knowledge, values and skills. In [Waldorf education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education) and [Montessori education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education) this is characterised as ‚Äúhead, heart and hands‚Äù outlined below and in figure \@ref(fig:headhearthands-fig) [@headhearthands]

1. **Head**: What do you *know*?
1. **Heart**: What do you *value*, what motivates you?
1. **Hands**: What can you *do*? What have you *done* so far? What will you do with your skills in the future? Your actions define your impact, see chapter \@ref(actioning)

```{r headhearthands-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionhhh)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Head, heart and hands.png")

### Ikigai: Reason for Being {#no42}

Many of the learning outcomes described above are non-trivial. You may have good self-awareness and be able to describe aspects of who you are in a matter of minutes. Other personality traits make take longer to uncover. You can develop better self-awareness by describing four attributes shown in Figure \@ref(fig:iki-fig), together these are known as your [ikigai (Áîü„ÅçÁî≤Êñê)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) or ‚Äúreason for being‚Äù.

* what do you love doing?
* what are you good at?
* what does the world need?
* what can you be paid for?

```{r iki-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captioniki)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/IKIGAI-visual-thinkery.png")
```
(ref:captioniki) Reasons for being, a concept in Japanese known as *ikigai*. According to ikigai, the most meaningful life lies at the intersection of four sets: (1) What you are good at, (2) What you love, (3) What the world needs and (4) What you can get paid for. What do *you* have in each of these sets and what are on your personal intersections? Ikigai sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

You'll be lucky if you can find activities at the intersection of all four sets shown Figure \@ref(fig:iki-fig). In practice, you may realistically only be able to achieve one, two or three intersections. That said, it's still a valuable exercise to think about what is in each set for you.

Take a sheet of paper, draw the four overlapping rings shown in Figure \@ref(fig:iki-fig), and spend five to ten minutes adding things in each ring.

* What are your values?
* What motivates you?
* Are there things you like doing that you aren‚Äôt particularly good at?
* Why does that make them enjoyable?

```{r know-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionknowthyself)"}

```

Thinking about your ikigai will clarify your knowledge of yourself. Some parts of your identity are so important that they are protected by legislation, in the UK and in other countries. The next section looks at those.

### Personality profiling {#personality}

Completing a personality profile may help you develop better self awareness. A good place to start is by answering 16 short questions at [icould.com/buzz-quiz](https://icould.com/buzz-quiz). Which animal are you?

There are lots of tools for personality profiling which go into more depth by asking you a lot more than 16 questions. Some of these services are free such as:

* [16personalities.com](https://www.16personalities.com)
* [strengthsprofile.com](https://strengthsprofile.com/en-GB/Products/Free)

Your University may also pay a subscription for personality profiling services, check with your careers service for details.

### Privilege audit {#apriv}

If you have privileges, it is important to recognise and acknowledge any advantages these have given you in life. They are a key part of your identity and who you are. If you don't recognise your privileges then you don't know yourself. Ask yourself *honestly*, what privileges do you have? For example, is it *just* your skills and knowledge that have got you into higher education, or have you been fortunate?

If you're struggling to think of any privileges, see section \@ref(privileged) for some suggestions.

Being mindful of any privileges that you have is not just a part of your identity. Being grateful for those privileges is beneficial for your mental health too, see the discussion of section \@ref(lays).

### Deathbed thought experiment {#regrets}

Imagine for a moment you are on your deathbed. Not at some point in the future, but right now. Your heart (see figure \@ref(fig:heart-fig)), which has served you well until now, starts behaving strangely. You start having palpitations and worry what's going on with the muscle responsible for keeping you alive. Worst case scenario is, your time is up. This happened to me and its a useful [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment) to force you to think about what matters in your life. [@deathbed]

```{r heart-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionheart)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/your-beating-heart.gif")
```
(ref:captionheart) One day your heart will stop beating, hopefully not for a long time yet, but it will happen. If you live for an average length of time, your heart will beat more than 2.5 billion times. Now imagine your heart will stop beating in a weeks time. As you reflect on your life, would you have any regrets? If so, what would they be? This *deathbed thought experiment* will force you to think about who you are and what you value. Computer generated cross section 3D model of the human heart via Wikimedia Commons by DrJanaOfficial at [w.wiki/36zc](https://w.wiki/36zc)

One of the things you'll probably want to do is reflect on your life and wonder:

* What did you achieve?
* Do you have any regrets, if so what are they?
* What would you change if you could carry on living?

This can be a useful technique for forcing you to think about who you are and what you value. If you find this activity difficult, see section \@ref(regret) for some hints.

Co-founder of [desana.io](https://desana.io/) Michael Cockburn argues that you should ‚Äúmake decisions as if you were on your deathbed‚Äù. [@cockburn] Remember that you have to die. *[Memento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori)*. Do you realise that everyone you know someday will die? Instead of saying all of your goodbyes, let them know you realise that life goes fast. It's hard to make the good things last. [@doyourealise]

(ref:breakpoint)

```md
* PAUSE ‚è∏Ô∏è
```

This chapter has looked at some big issues around identity, by inviting you to think about some fundamental questions. Another way to think about these questions is as coding challenges. They are non-trivial questions to answer, it might take you weeks, months or even years to answer some of them. But they are worth spending time thinking about

* What are your values?
* What makes you happy?
* What do you want to get from your time at University?
* What do you want after University?
* Where do you see yourself in $x$ years time?
* What are your privileges (if any), see section \@ref(privileged)

## Signposts from here on identity {#sign2}

This chapter challenges you to reflect on who you are and what you're good at. We've only scratched the surface, so if you want to dig deeper you'll find the following resources useful:

* *The Top Five Regrets of the Dying*
* *What Colour is Your Parachute?*
* *How Your Story Sets You Free*
* A range of books about privilege

### Your dying regrets? {#regret}  
One of *[The Top Five Regrets of the Dying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Top_Five_Regrets_of_the_Dying)* [@regrets] is that people wish they'd had the courage to live a life true to themselves, and not a life that others expected of them. Figuring out exactly who your authentic self is can be challenging. [Bronnie Ware's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronnie_Ware) book might help, it has some very moving, personal and insightful true stories of the regrets that people have that will illuminate your own values. The top five regrets, outlined in the book are:

1. I wish I‚Äôd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me
1. I wish I hadn‚Äôt worked so hard
1. I wish I‚Äôd had the courage to express my feelings
1. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends
1. I wish that I had let myself be happier

You need to be courageous to live a regret-free life but the alternative is to die full of regret, see Bronnie's video in figure \@ref(fig:bronnie-fig).


```{r bronnie-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "Palliative care nurse Bronnie Ware explains the top five regrets of the dying. [@youtube-bronnie] Bronnie learned a lot from looking after people on their deathbeds, then wrote it all down in a fantastic book [@regrets].

```
### Colouring your parachute {#parachute}  
Since first being published in 1972, over ten million copies of *[What Colour is Your Parachute?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Color_is_Your_Parachute%3F)* have been sold. It has been translated into 20 languages and is used in 26 countries. What is good about *Parachute* is that it has some useful *self-inventory* exercises that go beyond the introductory ones in this guidebook, particularly in the context of your future career. While the style and examples can be U.S. centric, it's a classic self-help book that looks at a broad variety of issues around job hunting. The author, [Richard Nelson Bolles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nelson_Bolles) was a Harvard educated chemical engineer and he once explained how you can't possibly decide what to do in five years time in the video in figure \@ref(fig:bolles-fig). Where do you see yourself in five years time? is a question some interviewers like to ask.


```{r bolles-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "Where will you be five years from now? Best-selling author of *Colouring Your Parachute* Dick Bolles discusses the gaps between education and employment.

knitr::include_graphics("images/youtube-bolles.png")

```

### What's your story? {#freeyourstory}
A useful technique for developing self-awareness is to think about what your story is. Heather Box and Julian Mocine-McQueen's book *How Your Story Sets You Free* [@freeyourstory] takes a storytelling approach to help you gain a better picture of who you are and what you value. What's good about this book is its short, less than 100 pages and contains practical exercises which extend those in this chapter.


### Check your privileges {#privileged}
Reflecting on your identity should lead you to check any privileges you might have. Being grateful for any privileges you may have is also beneficial for your mental health which we talk about in chapter \@ref(nurturing) so:

* **If you are white** a good place to start understanding your white privileges is *[Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_I'm_No_Longer_Talking_to_White_People_About_Race)* by [Reni Eddo Lodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reni_Eddo-Lodge) [@nottalking] and *[Superior: The Return of Race Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior:_The_Return_of_Race_Science)* by [Angela Saini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Saini)
* **If you are male** a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of being a man is *[Inferior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_(book))* by [Angela Saini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Saini) [@inferior]
* **If you are socially privileged** a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of your class is *The Class Ceiling: Why it Pays to be Privileged* by Sam Friedman and Daniel Laurison [@classceiling].
     + If you were privately (or selectively) educated in Britain (or elsewhere) you should read *[Engines of Privilege: Britain's Private School Problem ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engines_of_Privilege)* [@nicebutdim] or *Posh Boys* by  Robert Verkaik [@poshboys]
* **If you are heterosexual** a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of your sexual orientation is [Ben Britton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Britton)'s presentation on *No sexuality please, we're scientists*  [@nosex] which covers bisexuality and homosexuality, including lesbian and gay homosexuality
* **If you are gender binary** a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of being [gender binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary) is Ben Britton's presentation [@nosex] which also covers transgender, genderqueer, non-binary and plus identities.

If you think you got to where you are purely because of your talents, think again: there's good evidence to show that luck plays a much bigger role than many of us would like to imagine. [@luckynottalented] Luck is as much a part of your identity as your talents.

There is a lot more to your identity than your race, class, gender and sexual orientation, see your protected characteristics in section \@ref(protected).

## Summarising self awareness {#tldr2}
(ref:tldr)

**Know thyself** was one of three maxims inscribed on the [Temple of Apollo in Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Apollo_(Delphi)), in ancient Greece, see figure \@ref(fig:delphi-fig). It's still an important maxim thousands of years later. To know thy future, you must first know thyself.

```{r delphi-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiondelphi)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/know-thyself-delphi.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiondelphi) *Know thyself* was an important maxim in ancient Greece, written on temples like this one in Delphi. How well do you actually know yourself? Picture of the ruins of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi by Edward Knapczyk on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/5MEp](https://w.wiki/5MEp) adapted using the [Wikipedia App](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)


This chapter has looked at knowing yourself and who you are. Being self aware, understanding your strengths and weaknesses is key to getting what you need from your future. Questions about your identity are non-trivial, hopefully this chapter has started you thinking about who you are, what motivates you and what you want out of life. You will need to keep revisiting these questions about your identity because some aspects of your identity may change over time.

```{r mathers-known-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmathersknown)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/you-dont-know-you-dont-know.png")
```
(ref:captionmathersknown) You know what you know about your identity and who you are. What parts of your identity do you know you *don't* know? Are there things about you that you *don't know* that you *don't know*? What are the [unknown unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns) about you? [What you don‚Äôt know you don‚Äôt know](https://bryanmmathers.com/what-you-dont-know-you-dont-know) sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

What do you know and what don't you know about yourself, see figure \@ref(fig:mathers-known-fig)? These fundamental design questions you'll need to address when you starting building your future. We touched on understanding any privileges you may have as being important for understanding who you are but also in being beneficial for your mental health.

In the next chapter, we'll look at mental health in more detail.

# Nurturing your future {#nurturing}

It doesn't matter if you are a student, an employee or even both at the same time. To be successful at studying or working, you need to take your well-being seriously. By well-being, I mean your health and happiness. Your health isn't just about your physical health but also your mental health and the two are very closely linked. It's all too easy when you are busy or stressed to neglect your well-being and then **bad-stuff‚Ñ¢** happens. This chapter looks at your well-being, and how you can nurture it. Because looking after yourself now will also nurture your future. üòÄ

(ref:captionturunning) You probably already knew that [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) was an outstanding Computer Scientist, but did you know he was also a respectable athlete too? Turing ran, cycled and rowed to relieve stress, and came close to competing in the Olympics as a runner [@kottke]. This should come as no surprise, the connections between well-being and academic performance are widely documented. Image via Jonathan Swinton's biography *Alan Turing's Manchester*.

## What you will learn {#ilo3}

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

1. Identify some of the symptoms of mental ill health in yourself and your peers, particularly anxiety and depression
1. Describe five self-help techniques for improving mental health
1. Describe services and other people you can approach if you (or someone you know) is being affected by mental ill health and self-help isn't enough
1. Schedule activities for improving mental and physical health into your daily or weekly routine



<!--* Formulate strategies for coping with rejection and failure-->

## Stressed, depressed and exam obsessed? {#genz}
One of the main target audiences for this textbook is [Generation Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z), that's people born sometime between the mid-nineties to early 2000's. There's some evidence to suggest that Gen-Z-ers like you have a higher probability than previous generations of being, as *[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist)* puts it:

* Stressed
* Depressed
* Exam obsessed

Are you stressed? Depressed? Exam obsessed? Are you more worried about getting good grades than drinking too much or having unplanned pregnancies? According to *The Economist* members of Generation Z are more likely to be affected by mental health issues. [@generationz] If that's you then you are not alone. Stress, depression and results obsession have been around a while. Many people struggle with them so let's look at them in a bit more detail.

::: {.rmdcaution}
(ref:codingcaution)

I am neither a medical doctor or a psychologist!

This chapter is based on my personal experiences of clinical depression, [antidepressants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant) and the experience of close friends and colleagues who have been affected by generalised anxiety disorder. So this chapter gives you a quick overview of mental health and points you to where you can find out more.

If you are affected by mental ill health, you should speak to a trained professional.

## Mental ill health {#illhealth}

Stress can lead to many kinds of ill health. Turing was put under lots of stress by his government bosses, people like [Alastair Denniston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Denniston) and [Stewart Menzies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Menzies). [@imitationgame] When asked why he punished himself so much in training, Alan Turing's reply is shown in figure \@ref(fig:turing-stress-fig).

```{r turing-stress-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionturingstress)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/turunning-machine.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionturingstress) When asked why he trained so hard, [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) replied: ‚ÄúI have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard; it‚Äôs the only way I can get some release‚Äù. Like many, Turing found running a relief from the mental pressures he was under in his job. [@kottke] Studying can be stressful too and put you under pressure. Your academic performance at University can be significantly improved by taking regular exercise and it will improve your mental health too. Public domain portrait of Alan Turing aged 16 via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/oZx](https://w.wiki/oZx) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

University is a positive experience for many people, however like Alan, you may also experience periods of stress. This may also be accompanied by anxiety, loneliness and depression. Financial, social and academic pressures alongside concerns about employability, fallout from COVID-19, war in Ukraine and climate change etc can all have an impact on your wellbeing. Statistically, one in four of us will be affected by mental ill health during our lifetime. Two of the most common forms of mental ill health are:

* **Anxiety**: *persistent* feelings of unease, such as worry or fear
* **Depression**: a low mood that *lasts for a long time* and affects your everyday life. Being affected by depression is **not** the same as feeling sad
<!--* loneliness and isolation
* stress, how you feel under pressure-->
<!--Your brain is a complex organ that is not fully understood, so it is not surprising that brains sometimes need treatment when things go wrong.-->

The *persistent* and *lasting a long time* are important here because while its part of the human condition to worry and feel sad, that doesn't *necessarily* mean you are affected by poor mental health. How long is a long time? Definitions vary, but around two weeks is a good rule of thumb. There are many forces at play, feelings of sadness or anxiousness are normally balanced out by counteracting feelings of calm or happiness shown in figure \@ref(fig:free-body-fig).

```{r free-body-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfreebody)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Free body diagram.png")
```
(ref:captionfreebody) Your mental health is like a balloon, acted on by forces of anxiety, calmness, happiness and sadness. These opposing forces normally balance each other out over time. Crudely speaking: (üò∞ + üòé) + (üôÇ + üôÅ) = üòê. Good mental health means your balloon stays airborne, despite the inevitable up and downs. If you are affected by poor mental health, feelings of anxiety or sadness will outweigh their counterparts, leading to *persistent* anxiousness or depression. This will cause your balloon (mental health) to ‚Äúcrash‚Äù. This chapter introduces what these mental health issues are and what you can do if you, or someone you know, is affected by poor mental health.

### Anxiety {#anxiety}

Anxiety is one of most common mental health disorders and can lead to depression, increased risk of suicide. Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), a common form of anxiety is explained in the video in Figure \@ref(fig:anxious-fig) and at [nhs.uk/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder/). People who are affected by anxiety may struggle to function normally, and find routine everyday task difficult or impossible.


```{r anxious-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongad)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/youtube-anxiety.png")
```

(ref:captiongad) Generalised anxiety disorder is a condition characterised by excessive, persistent and unreasonable amounts of anxiety and worry about everyday things. [@youtube-anxiety] Note that the video takes an American perspective using American terminology such as [DSM‚Äì5](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm).

### Depression {#depression}

Millions of people around the world live with depression. If you are affected by depression it can be really hard to talk about it as there are many social stigmas around mental health. Thankfully depression is largely preventable and treatable. Recognising depression and seeking help is the first and most critical step towards recovery. To mark [World Mental Health Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day) writer and illustrator Matthew Johnstone tells the story of how he overcame the ‚Äúblack dog of depression‚Äù in the video in Figure \@ref(fig:sad-fig) made in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO).

```{r sad-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionblackdog)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/youtube-blackdog.png")
```

(ref:captionblackdog) Matthew Johnstone explains how he overcame the affects of depression, using the metaphor of the black dog [@youtube-blackdog]

### Drugs {#drugs}
Prescription medication can help some people with their mental health. For example, when I was affected by depression, [Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ssri-antidepressants/) (SSRIs) worked for me, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:citalopram-fig), but they don't for everybody. Sometimes the drugs don't work, they just make you worse. [@drugsdontwork]

```{r citalopram-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captioncitalopram)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/citalopram.jpg")
```

(ref:captioncitalopram) [Citalopram](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/citalopram/) is a type of antidepressant known as a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI). SSRI's can help some people who have been affected by depression. They work for some people (including me) but they don't for everybody. Skeletal formulae of Citalopram by Vaccinationist via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3Ddn](https://w.wiki/3Ddn) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238).

Some doctors prescribe [benzodiazepines](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/sleeping-pills-and-minor-tranquillisers/about-benzodiazepines/) for anxiety, which may be effective where SSRI's are not, but these can be addictive and have big side effects.

It is worth considering [cognitive behavioural therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) (CBT) before taking any medication.  *The Science of Wellbeing* (TSOWB) at [coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being) is an easy way to access some CBT free online, see the signposts section (section \@ref(signposts3)) at the end of this chapter. [@lauriesantos]

### Suicide {#suicide}
If you‚Äôre feeling suicidal, you don‚Äôt have to struggle with difficult feelings alone. If you‚Äôre suffering from emotional distress or struggling to cope a Samaritan can face your problems with you. Whatever you‚Äôre going through, [samaritans.org](https://www.samaritans.org/) are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They respond to around 10,000 calls for help in the UK every day. No judgement. No pressure. Call them free any time, from any phone (in the UK) on 116 123. It's important to talk to *somebody*, see figure \@ref(fig:joydivision-fig).

(ref:captionjoydivision) It might not be immediately obvious to you that people around you may be having suicidal thoughts. Ian Curtis was in a band called [Joy Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Division), even his fellow band members like [Bernard Sumner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Sumner) didn't realise how poor his mental health was until after his suicide. In retrospect it is obvious when you read his lyrics [@isolation]. However, people who are affected by poor mental health often don't talk about it until it is too late - so it can be tricky to diagnose and help them in time. Fair use picture of [Ian Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Curtis) by [Kevin Cummins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cummins_(photographer)) on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/4iWJ](https://w.wiki/4iWJ) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238).

Suicide is the biggest killer of under 35's in the UK. Like many, Ian Curtis in figure \@ref(fig:joydivision-fig) tragically took his own life when he was just 23 years old. Globally, over 700,000 people die due to suicide every year, see [who.int/health-topics/suicide](https://www.who.int/health-topics/suicide). Every life lost to suicide is a tragedy because suicide is preventable, by talking and listening. If you're feeling suicidal or you know someone who is, don't suffer (or let others suffer) in silence. Check out the resources in section \@ref(samaritans) and \@ref(papryus).

## Look after yourself {#lays}
Looking after yourself can serve to both prevent and treat mental health issues that can affect you in life. You might be your own worst critic, or perhaps when you're under pressure you neglect things that are proven to be beneficial for your mental health, like sleep, exercise, mindfulness and friendship. Looking after yourself means at least three things:

* being mindful of your feelings and learning to manage your inner critic
* being kind to yourself in various ways
* deliberately scheduling protected time to do the non-work things that matter.

```{r lookafter-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionlookafter)"}

Harvard Psychologist [Laurie Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_R._Santos) describes five evidence-based strategies for coping when times are really challenging and tough in the video in figure \@ref(fig:laurie-fig). Those strategies are:

1. **Exercise**: getting regular exercise improves both physical AND mental health.
1. **Gratitude**: research shows that being grateful can significantly improve your mental health. One way to do this is by keeping a gratitude journal, a log you fill in everyday of things you are grateful for. This can include both the small and big things in life.
1. **Sleep**: actively developing healthier sleep patterns. Poor sleep hygiene can be both cause and effect of poor mental health. See the discussion of *Why we sleep* [@whywesleep] in section \@ref(signposts3)
1. **Socialising**: give a higher priority to spending time with friends and family. There is good evidence to show this will make you happier than turning inward or diving deeper into work which could just make you more stressed, depressed or anxious [@lauranxiety]
1. **Mindfulness**: be mindful of emotions using the R.A.I.N. technique:
    * **R**ecognise: negative emotions
    * **A**ccept: accept and allow emotions rather than fighting them
    * **I**nvestigate: notice how the emotion feels inside your body
    * **N**urture: be kind to yourself, step away from your emotions by distancing yourself from them.<!--Ruby Wax calls this non-identification which is the same thing-->

It can help to think of negative emotions as coming from another person, an inner critic, rather than yourself. You are not your emotions and thoughts. Laurie explains the R.A.I.N. technique in figure \@ref(fig:laurie-fig).

<!-- also woop my life     -->

knitr::include_graphics("images/youtube-santos.png")
```

(ref:captionlaurie) Laurie Santos describes five coping techniques for improving wellbeing: Exercise, gratitude, sleep, getting social and meditation [@youtube-santos].

The techniques described by Santos are not merely trashy [pop psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_psychology) but scientifically proven techniques. [@yaden] So there are some simple things you can do to help yourself, but you may also need to seek help from others.

## Burnout {#burnout}
Sometimes a desire to be productive by overworking has exactly the opposite effect, because the sacrifices you make for work can be counter-productive. If you burn too brightly you might burnout completely, see [mentalhealth-uk.org/burnout](https://mentalhealth-uk.org/burnout/). üî•



```{r eval=knitr::is_html_output(excludes = "epub"), lizandmollie-fig,echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "test caption"}
library(tweetrmd)
include_tweet("https://twitter.com/lizandmollie/status/1231605700960432128")
```

Sacrificing sleep, socialising, exercise and time-out to recharge your batteries can make you *less* productive, especially in the longer term.

```{r eval=knitr::is_html_output(excludes = "epub"), paulnurse-fig,echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "test caption"}
library(tweetrmd)
include_tweet("https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/1485893990910148613")
```

I'm **not** saying don't work hard. Like [Paul Nurse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nurse), I am arguing that you shouldn't work *too* hard:

> ‚Äúif you really want to be good you musn't work too hard. If you work too hard just hard all the
> time you will keep going in the same direction. One big advantage of taking some relaxation is it
> makes your brain come down and then you come and look at it freshly. When you take off the
> pressure, to go off and go and walk for day then you can imagine new things.‚Äù
>
> `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Paul Nurse [@paulnurse]')`


So work hard but don't overwork. Overworking [will literally kill you](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210518-how-overwork-is-literally-killing-us). [@overworking]

If you're making to many sacrifices to get the grades you want, ask yourself, is it really worth it. See section \@ref(entitled), \@ref(regret) and read [Is a first class degree really that important](https://www.ft.com/content/8a2ee9b4-bd0f-11e9-b350-db00d509634e)? You may need to recalibrate your relationship and expectations of work to either recover from burnout, or stop burning out in the first place [@happyburnout]

<!-- todo: how hard should you work for first class-->

## Help is available if you need it {#notalone}
If you are affected by mental ill health, particularly anxiety or depression, it can be hard:

* to recognise that you need help in the first place
* to help yourself using self-help resources
* to ask others to help you

Even if you don't need help, it is important to recognise and understand the symptoms of mental ill health. It's quite likely that someone you know will suffer from mental health issues and as their friend or peer, it might be you that can help by encouraging them to get the help they wouldn't otherwise ask for.  

**You are not alone**, help is available if you (or your friends) need it from a wide variety of sources:

### Your University {#unihelp}
There are lots of people who can help you:  

* your personal tutor or other academic members of staff
* non-academic staff in the University, for example in Manchester contact the Student Support Office (SSO) [studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk](https://www.studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk/)
* counselling services, for example contact [counsellingservice.manchester.ac.uk](https://www.counsellingservice.manchester.ac.uk/). The counselling service offers help on dealing with anxiety, depression, exam stress, confidence and other issues.
* peers, flat-mates, family, friends etc. People close to you can help, although some people affected by mental health find it easier to discuss mental health with a trained professional or volunteer because of the social stigmas. There are lots of services outlined below that provide this kind of service.

<!--## Physical Turing Test {#turingtest}  

Turing took up long-distance running and was good enough to come close to being selected for the English national team and competing in the Olympics.  It is no coincidence that alongside Turing's extraordinary mental capabilities he had good physical health because these abilities complement each other. If you look after your physical health, you will be able to relieve the stresses and anxieties in your life to improve your mental health. You'll also ensure you can perform to the best of your mental abilities while at University and beyond. You can find out more about Alan Turing's time in Manchester in Jonathan Swinton's enlightening biography *Alan Turing's Manchester* [@manturing]-->

## Developing a growth mindset {#growthmindset}

Learning at University can be hard because you might have gone from being at (or near) the top of the class in high school to no longer being top of the class at University.

Likewise the job hunting described in chapter \@ref(finding) can take a heavy toll on your mental health because repeated rejection is an ordinary part of the process. It can be time consuming, stressful and demoralising. You may find your applications disappear into a black hole. They will be ghosted (ignored) by employers. Interviewers will blank you and refuse to give you meaningful feedback because they're too busy. This could happen multiple times. This is all *[par for the course](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/par_for_the_course)*, normal and expected, and is not necessarily a reflection on your abilities or potential. See the examples in the coding interview section \@ref(codinginterview). [@youtube-petia]

```{r fixedminset-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfixedmindset)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/the-fixed-mindset.png")
```
(ref:captionfixedmindset) A fixed mindset is monolithic like the [Easter island statues (mo ªai)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moai). If you're not already, you should be wary of a fixed mindset. [Fixed mindsets](https://bryanmmathers.com/fixed-mindsets/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Adopting a growth mindset can be a successful strategy for maintaining your wellbeing, see figure \@ref(fig:fixedminset-fig). If your grades aren't has good as you hoped or your search for employment is being met with repeated rejection, a growth mindset can help. Let's take rejection from potential employers as an example, there are two ways you can react to it:

1. ***Fixed mindset***: responding with a fixed mindset will mean you are likely to take rejection personally. You might even assume that this confirms what you've always suspected. You're not good enough or that you made some fatal mistake in your applications or interviews. Ouch.
2. ***Growth mindset***: by responding to rejection with a growth mindset, you focus on what happens next. Rejection is not failure but a "not yet" described in figure \@ref(fig:not-fig). Maybe you're not yet ready for that employer, but you'll definitely have a good idea of what you learned from the process and how can you do better next time.

According to Stanford psychologist [Carol Dweck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck) we can all be placed on a spectrum describing where we think our abilities come from. At one end, the fixed mindset assumes all kinds of abilities are fixed traits while at the other end, a growth mindset assumes these abilities can be developed over time. [@dweck] There is good evidence that adopting a growth mindset will make you a better learner who can cope with the inevitable failures and rejections in life better. This approach can be used in a range of different disciplines such as learning programming languages [@Cutts2010], music [@Davis2016] and job hunting.

## Wellbeing signposts {#signposts3}

This chapter has looked at your wellbeing and especially the role that both your mental health and physical health play in your future. [Matt Haig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Haig)‚Äôs first-hand accounts of poor mental health will be comforting to anyone who is affected by mental ill health. Even if you're not affected, there is a 25% chance you will be at some point in your life. There‚Äôs also a high probability someone close to you will suffer from mental health issues. It might be a colleague, friend, family member, fellow student or partner, so it is worth educating yourself on the issues by reading his two short books:

1. *Notes on a Nervous Planet* is a personal account of anxiety [@nervousplanet]
1. *[Reasons to Stay Alive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasons_to_Stay_Alive)* is a personal account of depression [@stayalive]

What‚Äôs good about Matt Haig‚Äôs books is they are quick and easy to read, but give plenty of first-hand insight into what mental ill-health can do to people (including you). Matt describes his top five tips for good mental health in figure \@ref(fig:haig-fig)

```{r haig-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionhaig)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/youtube-haig.png")
```
(ref:captionhaig) Two of Matt Haig's top five tips for good mental health [@youtube-haig] include 1. Being more careful (and mindful) of social media and 2. Reading more books because books are good for your soul. Not just his book. Any book. Books are good for you. Trust me on this. [@bookfriends]

There‚Äôs plenty of evidence that social media can have a detrimental effect on health. [Jaron Lanier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier)‚Äôs skeptical polemic *Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now* [@lanier] is a thought-provoking romp through some of the pitfalls of social media that may have you reaching for the delete or un-install button fairly quickly. You don't have to be on social media, see figure \@ref(fig:socialmedia-fig).

```{r socialmedia-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "32%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionsocialmedia)"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/you-dont-have-to-be-on-social-media.png", 3))
```

(ref:captionsocialmedia) Social media like LinkedIn clearly has its uses (see section \@ref(links)) but you you don't *have* to be on it at all. Poor mental health is just one reason to be wary of social media, for nine other reasons read [Jaron Lanier's polemic](http://www.jaronlanier.com/tenarguments.html). [@lanier] Notes to Strangers by [andy-leek.com](http://www.andy-leek.com/) photographed by [Duncan Cumming](https://www.flickr.com/photos/duncan/51014540593)

If all these books are making you sleepy, neuroscientist Matthew Walker‚Äôs *[Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Sleep)* may change your view on the importance of a good nights sleep. [@whywesleep]

Finally, it's well worth taking a look at [Laurie Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_R._Santos) course on *The Science of Wellbeing* (TSOWB) at [coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being). [@lauriesantos] TSOWB course provides an alternative to medication as it follows the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

TSOWB is the most popular course at Yale University and looks at some simple techniques you can use to improve your happiness. [@happinessny] The course will help you increase your happiness and build more productive habits. Using the latest research, Santos describes the misconceptions about happiness and ‚Äúannoying features‚Äù of your mind that can impair your well-being. The course takes about 19 hours to complete but you can spread this over a whole semester (or longer) if you choose. The short clip in figure \@ref(fig:laurie-fig) gives you a brief taster of Laurie's style and work.

(ref:captionmindyourhealth) Accepting yourself for who you are will improve your mental health and self-esteem. This can, in turn, help you prevent or treat problems caused by anxiety and depression. Poster via [mind.org.uk](https://www.mind.org.uk/)

Anxiety and depression are serious conditions that are very likely to affect you or somebody close to you while you are at University. There's a one in four chance that you will be affected by mental health issues at some point in your life.

We've only talked about two particular mental health issues, anxiety and depression, but there are many other conditions such as phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, self-harm and more that are beyond the scope of this chapter. They do have one thing in common, and that is that talking about them is an important part of starting to develop better mental health. Mental health can affect everyone, all genders, classes and races.

library(tweetrmd)
include_tweet("https://twitter.com/profbuchan/status/1540228377608585216")
```


If you are affected by mental ill health, talking about it is the best place to start, but often the hardest. You can continue by:

1. Accepting yourself for who you are, see chapter \@ref(knowing)
1. Learning to identify and challenge unhelpful thinking patterns
1. Avoiding the trap of compare yourself to other people too much

... are three more steps you can take to help yourself, see figure \@ref(fig:mindyourhealth-fig). In this chapter, I've outlined some ways you can help yourself alongside some of the services and people you can talk to if you need to.

Despite how you might feel, you are not alone.

Take my thoughts with you and when you look behind, you will surely see, a face that you recognise, you're not alone. [@yourenotalone]

Your ability to write clearly isn't just important when putting together CV's like in figure \@ref(fig:no-writing-fig). Your ability to write clearly isn't just important when composing covering letters or filling in application forms either, it's a fundamental skill that will help you become a valued employee in the longer term.

In this chapter you will learn to:

1. Recognise the importance of written communication, both as a reader and a writer
1. Identify examples of where written communication is crucial in teams of scientists and engineers
1. Improve your written communication skills using some simple writing and reading exercises
<!--* Identify the importance of teamwork-->

## Writing as a soft social skill {#softwrite}

Your soft social skills will take a **life time** to develop and are **really hard** use. Why? Because soft skills are about *communicating* with and *understanding* other people so that you can work *together* as a team toward a shared goal. Your soft skills are hard.

There are very few jobs where you work on your own in complete isolation. For example, most software and hardware is designed, built, tested and used by teams of people. Many of these teams are large and have very diverse membership. This means that sooner or later you're going to have to master the dark arts of *working with other people* by developing and deploying your softer skills. One of those softer skills you'll need to continuously develop is written communication.

Communicating with other people and working in teams is inherently difficult because we're all human. There is good news and bad news...

* **THE GOOD NEWS** is, people can be diligent, humble, competent, honest, caring and reliable. They can be co-operative, generous, supportive, kind, thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive, understanding, punctual and professional too!
* **THE BAD NEWS** is, unfortunately people can also be lazy, stupid, ignorant, vain, incompetent, dishonest, unreliable, greedy, egomaniacal, unpredictable and moody. They can be proud, selfish, competitive, lustful, angry, envious, mean, busy, insensitive and thoughtless too. Some will disagree with you, boss you around, betray, exploit, misunderstand and mislead you, deliberately or otherwise. [@sevendeadly]

This *shouldn't* be news to you but it means communicating with and understanding other people can be hard work, but don't worry, **everyone** finds this challenging, it's not just you! It doesn't matter if you're an extrovert or an introvert, communication is a challenge for everybody, and everyone can get better at it too. This chapter takes a look at the softer skill of written communication and techniques you can use to improve your writing. Whatever mood your readers are in, they'll find it a lot easier to work with you when you can express yourself clearly in writing.

## Computing is your superpower! {#superpower}

Studying computer science gives you an *awesome* superpower. We will look at some of the reasons why in chapter \@ref(computing) on *Computing your Future*. But for now, let us just acknowledge that hard technical skills like computing are highly sought after and valuable, both commercially and otherwise.

```{r achilles-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionachilles)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Achilles-Heel-to-Superpower.png")
```
(ref:captionachilles) Computing is a superpower that gods like [Hermes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes) and mortal heroes like [Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles) would probably have envied. [@heroes; @mythos] As a technical or *hard skill*, computing is a crucial weapon in your armoury but what are your weaker skills? What is your [Achilles' heel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_heel)? For some scientists and engineers, their weakness is their soft skills, such as communication. Writing, reading, speaking and listening to communicate with team members can be a weaker skill for many technical people. This chapter looks at what you can do to improve these skills and convince employers that you are rounded individual with a healthy balance of soft and hard skills.

Your computational superpower is less powerful if it isn't complemented by a broad range of softer skills. Typically, these skills are not closely examined in most computer science degrees, for example by repeated assessment. There's an awful lot of [technical computing curriculum](https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations) that tends to have a higher priority over soft skills. It's not that soft skills aren't important but that are hard to quantify.

For example, if I want to know how good you are at understanding the syntax and semantics of a programming language like Python, there are tried and tested techniques for measuring this. However, if I want to know how good you are at using your communication skills to work in a team of engineers to negotiate, lead, resolve conflicts, persuade others, show empathy etc that's **much** harder to measure accurately. What technical degrees tend to measure is technical skills because softer skills, shown in figure \@ref(fig:allskills-fig), are much harder to assess by examination and coursework. This is one of the many reasons that you are much more than your grades, see figure \@ref(fig:more-than-grades-fig).

```{r allskills-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionallskills)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Hard and soft skills.png")
```

(ref:captionallskills) Hard skills and soft skills aren't much use without each other. You will need both to survive and thrive but most science and engineering education focuses on your hard skills, not your soft skills. Why? Because hard skills are often much easier to measure.

Let's look at some of low-level communication skills (`I/O`) that they are built on.

## Communication I/0 {#cio}

In terms of input and output, your fundamental communication skills are listening, speaking, reading and writing words in natural languages shown in table \@ref(tab:iotable). These are the ‚Äú[assembly languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)‚Äù of human communication. This might sound blindingly obvious, but these skills are often under-estimated or undervalued by engineers and scientists, especially undergraduates. Alongside verbal and written communication, there's also nonverbal language, or body language such as eye contact, gestures and facial expressions.


```{r iotable, echo = FALSE}
io_table <- tibble::tribble(
    ~ ""                        , ~ "Input",      ~ "Output",
  "Written natural language"    , "Reading",        "Writing",
  "Spoken natural language"     , "Listening",      "Speaking",
  "Nonverbal language"    , "Observing other people",      "Being observed by others",
)
knitr::kable(io_table, caption = "The inputs and outputs of the fundamental assembly languages of human communication ", booktabs = TRUE)
```

Some people leave plenty of room for improvement when it comes to the communication skills outlined in table \@ref(tab:iotable). Think of:

* the stereotypical mad scientist, clad in a white coat, unable to explain the complexities of their research to people inside their lab, let alone outside of it, see figure \@ref(fig:madscientist-fig)
* the nerdy software engineer stereotype who prefers the company of computers to people

Yes, these are lazy tropes and unhelpful stereotypes, but they express public perception of scientists and engineers as poor communicators. Don't perpetuate the stereotype by being a bad communicator.

```{r madscientist-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmadscientist)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mad-scientist.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionmadscientist) Are you [mad, bad and dangerous to know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad,_Bad_and_Dangerous_to_Know)? You'll be familiar with the [mad scientist stereotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_scientist): perceived as an evil genius owing to a combination of unsettling personality traits and the unabashedly ambitious, taboo or hubristic nature of their experiments. Besides their supposed insanity, another reason mad scientists (and engineers) are perceived badly, is their poor communication skills. Maybe if they could communicate better the public might understand and trust them more? Don't perpetuate the stereotype by being a poor communicator, there are too many of those already!

### The pen is mightier than the sword {#mightier}
The art of communication is a huge subject which extends far beyond the scope of this guidebook. So for the rest of this chapter, we'll focus on your superpower of written communication. The pen (and keyboard) are mightier than the sword, see figure \@ref(fig:mighty-pen-fig).

```{r mighty-pen-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmightypen)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/the-pen-is-mightier-than-the-sword.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionmightypen) Do you need more weaponry in your life? Besides computing, you should arm yourself with communication superpowers. It's in your own selfish interests to continuously develop your written communication skills because [the pen is mightier than the sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_pen_is_mightier_than_the_sword). Public domain image of a drawing of Cardinal Richelieu by [Henry Alexander Ogden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Alexander_Ogden) via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3WHg](https://w.wiki/3WHg) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Written communication skills are important because:

1. **Good writing and reading are crucial in applications** for employment and further study. From writing CV's, covering letters, completing application forms and reading job specifications, and employer (or course) information, your ability to read and write in natural languages is crucial to coding your future.
1. **Writing often gets neglected**: Written communication skills (both reading and writing) are sometimes sidelined in science and engineering degrees. This is particularly true in the ‚Äúhard sciences‚Äù. For example, communicating and solving problems using code or mathematics are usually the dominant forms of assessment in computer science courses. That's understandable given the subject, but tends to push natural languages (like english) to the sidelines.
1. **Good engineers are also good writers** Many engineers (and scientists) could significantly improve their written communication skills. Software engineers are notoriously bad at writing, see for example [Why Computer Science Students Need Language](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/960492.960525), [@Beaubouef2003] *Scientists Must Write* [@scientistsmustwrite] and [The Real Reason Silicon Valley Coders Write Bad Software](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-real-reason-silicon-valley-coders-write-bad-software/263377/), [@writebadsoftware] just three examples amongst many others making exactly the same point. Employers like Google provide training (and a whole career path) for technical writers, see [developers.google.com/tech-writing](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing). I'm glad they exist, but these careers and courses wouldn't be needed if software engineers were better at documenting, explaining and communicating with other human beings in the first place!
1. **Writing good english is like writing good code**. Some of the skills you already have in coding can be transferred to written communication. Just like a good `function`, `class` or `method` in code should be well-defined with a clear purpose, your writing should also be clear and coherent. Well structured writing is a lot like well architected software too, with a clear [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) (SoC)
1. **It is relatively easy to improve** your written communication skills, simply by reading and writing more. Reading and writing deliberately every day, will significantly improve these skills. See the rest of this chapter for some simple exercises to get started with and:
      + chapter \@ref(debugging) on *Debugging your future*
      + chapter \@ref(hacking) on *Hacking your future* for details. <!--editing your future-->

### Natural language engineering {#nle}
As a species, we've been writing stuff down for millenia in order to communicate with each other, see figure \@ref(fig:rosetta-fig). If you stop to think about it, engineers and scientists spend a *lot* time communicating in writing. As well as engineering `code`, they also spend a significant amount of time engineering *messages* in natural languages like english.

```{r rosetta-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionrosetta)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rosetta-stone.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionrosetta) Have you ever noticed how when people become serious about communication, they want it in [writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing)? CC BY-SA image of language in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic, demotic and Ancient Greek written on the [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) by [Hans Hillewaert](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Photographs_by_Hans_Hillewaert) on Wikimedia commons [w.wiki/3Ycn](https://w.wiki/3Ycn) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Consider the following:

* email and instant messaging, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Zoom etc
* Posting on social media: LinkedIn, Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, blogs, Medium.com etc
* bug reports and messages in [issue trackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue-tracking_systems) like Jira, BugZilla, Trello and version control system s like Github and Gitlab etc
* 'How to' and cookbook style articles and books
* API reference material
* in-code documentation `# comments in code`
* [Self-documenting code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code) that describes itself
* Executable specifications in test suites like [cucumber.io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_(software))
* Laboratory manuals and laboratory notebooks
* The one or two page summary for management
* [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/) and hacker news [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/) etc
* User documentation, release notes
* Case studies of software use
* Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
* Personal websites `YourPersonalDomain.com` if you have one
* Questions and answers on forums like [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* Commit messages in version control systems like git and mercurial etc
* Architecture documentation and design specifications
* [Literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) natural language descriptions of computational logic [@knuthlit]
* [Jupyter.org notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), code and natural language mixed together, as do many other systems like, [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/) and [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/)


What do they all have in common? They're all written in natural languages like the [English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language), but without them, the software or hardware they describe and discuss would be useless. Using written (and spoken) natural language is a key social skill and a communication skill. You might be using your language to influence, persuade, convince or argue with members of your team. So it is important that you do it to the best of your abilities. Computer Scientist [Luis von Ahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_von_Ahn), shown in figure \@ref(fig:vonahn-fig), is the creator of [Duolingo.com](https://www.duolingo.com/). Luis regrets that he didn't spend any effort developing his social skills early in his career. Instead, like many computer scientists he focussed his effort on his mathematical and technical skills instead. [@vonahn]

<!-- I did not spend any effort developing my social skills. A lot of management skills are just social skills-->

```

(ref:captionvonahn) Luis von Ahn is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Duolingo. Since 2012, the duolingo app has been downloaded 500 million times. Luis wishes he'd concentrated on developing his social skills earlier his career. Are you developing your hard technical skills at the expense of your softer social skills?

Making software isn't all about what you can do as an individual but rather how you communicate with and contribute to your team. It's easy to get carried away with your ego. Remember that most jobs require *lots* of softer people skills and collaboration, written communication is a huge part of that, alongside spoken communication see for example [The Myth of the Genius Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ). [@Fitzpatrick]

<!--
1. **Its not just engineers that can improve** If the huge volume of literature on the importance of writing is anything to go by,  it's not just engineers and scientists that could improve their written communication skills, see for example the complete plain words. [@gowers; @writingatuni]-->
### Writing as therapy {#therapy}
Besides being a tool for communication, writing can be therapeutic for the writer too. The simple act of writing can help you tackle mental health issues discussed in chapter \@ref(nurturing). Prime minister [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) found that writing helped to keep the ‚Äúblack dog‚Äù of his depression under control, see section \@ref(depression) and figure \@ref(fig:winston-fig).

```{r winston-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionwinston)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/churchill.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionwinston) Winston Churchill managed to regulate his depression by writing. If you are affected by anxiety or depression, you may find that private forms of writing like those described in section \@ref(dailywrite) will help to improve your mental health. Public domain portrait of Winston Churchill by [Yousuf Karsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yousuf_Karsh) on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/4aJk](https://w.wiki/4aJk)

So writing can be therapeutic, a powerful tool for developing [mindfulness](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/tips-and-support/mindfulness/) as well as communicating with other people.

## Writing your future {#wyf}
Hopefully I've convinced you that written communication skills (both as a writer and reader) are important soft skills that engineers often neglect. So how can you improve?

### Dogfooding {#dogfooding}

<!-- similar to rubber duck debugging https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging-->
Many employers test their products and services by trialling them on their own employees, this is known as [eating your own dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) shown in figure \@ref(fig:dogfooding-fig). Tasty, tasty dogfood. üê∂

```{r dogfooding-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiondogfooding)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Dogfooding.png")
```

(ref:captiondogfooding) Reading your own writing (aloud) is like [eating your own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). It's a simple and proven technique for improving your written communication in job applications such as covering letters, CVs, personal statements and the like. Dogfooding by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/))

Dogfooding is a simple technique for testing your own writing. Let's say you've just written a personal statement or covering letter (see section \@ref(we3qs)). It's natural to read it over in your head to check for errors, before you send it. However, **reading it aloud** will pick up errors you may not have spotted by reading silently. There's something about articulating words out loud that flushes out errors you don't pick up when you read them in your head. Dogfooding is a tried and tested technique. It also means you're ready to vocalise those answers in an interview.

You might want to choose carefully where you do this as it might look a bit strange, but it works well. If you talk into a mobile phone while looking at a piece of paper, people won't notice you're talking to yourself. But you'll probably need some privacy as the stuff you're talking about is likely to be personal. Alternatively, find a critical friend who you can read out loud to.


### Try Google's Tech Writing course {#techwriting}
Google have developed some excellent written communication courses for software engineers, and those looking to become technical writers:

1. Technical Writing One: Technical Writing Fundamentals for Engineers [developers.google.com/tech-writing/one](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one)
1. Technical Writing Two: Intermediate Technical Writing for Engineers [developers.google.com/tech-writing/two](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/two)

These courses run as part of the second year course COMP2CARS at the University of Manchester, see chapter \@ref(scheduling) for details.

Google occasionally delivers these technical writing courses as free sessions open to the general public. For details, see [developers.google.com/tech-writing/announcements](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/announcements) for details.

### Deliberate daily writing {#dailywrite}
Another technique for improving your written communication is to write something every day, that might be a personal diary that only you read, or it could be something more public like blog.  Schedule a time every day, say 15 to 30 minutes when you will do this without fail. That writing could take several forms:

* public web log or [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog)
* [gratitude journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal) see section \@ref(lays)
* private diary or personal laboratory notebook
* morning pages, a unedited stream of conciousness that can help you become more creative [@cameron;@burkeman]
* [bullet journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal). Some people swear by it, see [bulletjournal.com](https://bulletjournal.com/)
<!--* contributing to Wikipedia-->

The technique of *30 minutes per day* can be a very effective way of getting things done, incrementally over time. In my experience it works for lots of things besides writing including getting exercise (discussed in chapter \@ref(nurturing)) to gardening. [@leendertz]

<!-- why write

* Writing speeds your brain up "worrying about remembering one idea gets in the way of having the next. Pen and paper wick ideas." [1]
* Writing slows your brain down, mindfulness etc
* Writing is therapy (for the writer)
* Writing helps the writer reflect on and clarify complicated thoughts
* The pen is mightier than the sword (etc)
http://www.paulgraham.com/island.html
-->

### Deliberate daily reading {#dailyread}
Reading other people's code will improve your software engineering skills. Likewise, reading other peoples writing will improve your natural language engineering skills. Read anything, it might be novels, magazines, newspapers, stuff online or any of the books cited in chapter \@ref(reading). Find a time and place to do this every day and stick to it, see figure \@ref(fig:reading-fig)

```{r reading-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionreading)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/the-motivation-for-reading.png")
```

(ref:captionreading) Reading allows you to learn from other people's hard won experience whilst also improving your own written communication skills. Just like you improve your coding skills by reading *and* writing code, you will improve your written communication skills by reading *and* writing in natural languages.

### Reading the friendly manual {#rtfm}

You don't get good at communicating with computers (coding) by just *writing* lots of code. You also need to *read* other people's code too and be able to understand and modify it. Likewise, you don't get good at communicating with people by just *writing* stuff in natural languages like english. You need to *read* stuff too. Books, manuals, software documentation, articles, use cases, novels, poetry, plays, magazines, newspapers etc. Reading this stuff will help you learn and you'll improve your written communication skills too. So *Read The Friendly Manual*. [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM). Read THIS Friendly Manual and the stuff it cites, see figure \@ref(fig:rtfm-fig)


```{r rtfm-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionrtfm)"}

## Summarising your soft skills {#tldr4}

[Too long, didn't read](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read) (TL;DR)? Here's a summary:

You'll need both soft and hard skills to compete in the workplace. Don't underestimate the importance of softer skills, we've looked briefly at written communication skills in this chapter but that's only the tip of the soft skills iceberg.

Teamwork, negotiation, conflict resolution, public speaking, motivating others and leadership are also important soft skills too. How can you develop these skills while at University? How can you demonstrate to potential employers that you have these skills? Your technical skills are of limited use without people skills, to allow you to work with others see figure \@ref(fig:otherpeople-fig).

```{r otherpeople-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionotherpeople)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/What - other people.png")
```
(ref:captionotherpeople) Unless you want to be a [lighthouse keeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_keeper) on a remote island, there are very few jobs where you don't have to work as part of a team with other people. Sorry to break the bad news! This means you need to constantly improve your softer skills and provide evidence of them to potential employers. Written communication is just one of those softer skills.

So communicating with other people is a key skill, see figure \@ref(fig:allpeople-fig). This chapter has looked at written communication, in chapter \@ref(speaking) we will look at spoken communication.

# Experiencing your future {#experiencing}

So, tell me, are you experienced? Why is experience valuable and what kind of experience are employers looking for anyway? How can you get some more experience? ü§î

```{r 404-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:caption404)"}

```

(ref:caption404) Do you respond with a sheepish `experience not found` when people ask about your experience? Is your experience like the [classic page not found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) error message `HTTP 404`? The client sent you a valid request for your experience, but your server couldn't find it. Awkward. Embarrassing silence? üò≥ Don't worry, there are some simple and easy ways to build your experience so that instead of negative 404's, you can respond with a cheerfully positive `200 (OK)`, as described in this [list of HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). We'll look at some of them in this chapter.

```

(ref:captionrelevantexp) You might be surprised by which of your experiences are relevant, and what kinds of experience are relevant on your CV. What's relevant sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

## Why is experience so valuable?

It's common for students to be focused on their grades, whether those grades are low, middling or or high. At the extremes, if you have got lower grades than you'd like, you might be anxious or unhappy about them. If you've got higher grades, you're probably focussed on keeping them high. Either way, you are *much more* than your grades, because your education is only a part of who you are. You are the sum total of your experiences, this is one of the reasons that experience is so valuable, see figure \@ref(fig:experience-fig)

```{r experience-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionexperience)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/experience.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionexperience) [Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience) is one of the best ways to develop *know-how*. While your formal education and academic study can help you develop *know-what*, you need to complement this knowledge with a range of experiences and on-the-job learning. This astronaut is training to work in microgravity by completing tasks underwater in a space suit. Like the astronaut, your education needs to combine academic study, with practical experience on-the-job. Public domain image of [Christer Fuglesang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christer_Fuglesang) training in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) by NASA on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3WBf](https://w.wiki/3WBf) adapted using the [Wikipedia App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238).

Your experience tells a story about who you are and what you're capable of. Experience makes you more *employable* which means:

1. experience will validate what you have already learned, see chapter \@ref(sneha)
1. experience will motivate you to learn more
1. experience will improve your confidence [@jackiecarter]
1. experience will broaden and deepen your skills and knowledge, see figure \@ref(fig:goal-fig)
1. experience will improve your chances of being invited to interview
1. experience will improve your chances of being offered a job after an interview
1. experience will broaden your professional network of contacts, both the strong and weak ties see section \@ref(weakties)


Paul Redmond at the University of Liverpool describes experience as a key part of employability [@paulredmond] as expressed in his graduate jobs formula shown in equation \@ref(eq:redmond).

::: {.rmdnote}

\begin{equation}
  E = Q + WE + S \times C
  (\#eq:redmond)
\end{equation}

:::

According to Redmond, your employability ($E$) is the sum of your qualifications ($Q$), your work experience ($WE$) and your strategies ($S$) multiplied by your contacts ($C$). It is difficult to quantify employability so precisely but Redmond's equation \@ref(eq:redmond) is a good starting point for discussion. We will look at some strategies and contacts in chapter \@ref(finding), this chapter will focus on how to maximise your experience ($WE$).

## Are you experienced? {#areuexperienced}

So what counts as experience? Employers use terms to describe jobs and experience for undergraduates and graduates inconsistently. So I've defined and outlined terms for relevant kinds of experience shown in table \@ref(tab:jobterms) and we'll use these definitions throughout the book.

```{r jobterms, echo = FALSE}
jobterm_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ "Experience", ~ "Description",
  "Casual", "Part-time or casual work, for example in hospitality or retail etc",
  "Voluntary", "Unpaid, both in technical and non-technical roles",
  "Entrepreneurial", "Self-employment, freelancing, contracting, ‚Äúmoonlighting‚Äù in a [side job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_job) or starting as a [sole-trader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_proprietorship) or small business",  
  "Insight", "Usually no contract of employment. One to three weeks, sometimes known as work experience, [work shadowing](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/jobs-and-work-experience/work-experience-and-internships/work-shadowing), spring weeks, vacation schemes or even [externships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externship). Sometimes unpaid, but often expensed. See [ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights](https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights) for some examples",
  "Internship", "Fixed term contract of employment, typically 3 months full-time over summer, but anywhere between 1 and 6 months. Sometimes part-time, *may* be an assessed part of an undergraduate or postgraduate degree. Usually prior to graduation, but some employers offer *graduate internships*, which should really be called fixed-term graduate jobs (or schemes)",
  "Placement", "Fixed term contract of employment, typically 12 months long and an assessed part of a degree. In Europe they are sometimes known as a ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù or ‚Äúindustrial experience‚Äù years because they typically take place in the *penultimate* (last but one) year of a degree. In America, placements are usually [known as co-ops](https://career.vt.edu/experience/ceip/ceip-internship-coop.html)",
  "Graduate job", "Full-time permanent contract typically working in one department of an organisation",
  "Graduate scheme", "Full-time permanent contract. Fast-track or high-flier managerial scheme, in your first two years, you'll probably rotate around different departments in an organisation"
)
knitr::kable(jobterm_table, caption = "Are you experienced? Terms used throughout this guidebook to describe experience, employment and their definitions", booktabs = TRUE)
```

<!-- to do compare and contrast summer vs year long-->

Some of the experience outlined in table \@ref(tab:jobterms) was probably what you were already thinking of as experience, however there are three important sources of experience that students often overlook:

1. **Voluntary work**: Any kind of work where you've given your time and labour to a community. That could be non-technical (working for a charity) or technical, such as contributing to open-source software, see section \@ref(opensource) and figure \@ref(fig:volunthero-fig)
2. **Casual work**: Working in hospitality or retail (etc) is often overlooked by students as an important source of relevant experience. It doesn't have to be technical to be relevant to employers, see section \@ref(casual)
3. **Student societies** Your students' union will have hundreds of official societies you can get involved in, and they'll be plenty of unofficial fringe communities too. As well as helping you develop new or existing interests, these societies give you an opportunity to serve a particular community of interest. Many societies seek members to take on positions of responsibility, above and beyond merely participating in their events. They provide fantastic opportunities to build new skills in a safe and supportive environment.

```{r volunthero-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionvolunthero)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/volunthero.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionvolunthero) [Volunteering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering) is a great source of experience that employers value. That could mean volunteering for charitable causes, taking responsibility in a student society or getting involved in open source projects. Picture of volunteers cleaning up after Hurricane Sandy in 2012 by Jim Henderson via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3Z96](https://w.wiki/3Z96) adapted using the [Wikipedia App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238).

Before we discuss these experiences, lets look at some of the more conventional places for getting experience:

<!--* Competitions: participating in competitions and hackathons will make your CV stand out-->

### Big name experience {#bignames}

It's probably easier than you might think to get a [big tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) or big employer name on your CV. For example, many large employers run [insight days, vacation schemes and spring weeks ](https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights). These are often aimed at first year undergraduates, and are sometimes less competitive to get into than a longer term commitment such as a summer internship, year-long placement or even graduate job. A big name on your CV early in your degree can help it stand out later, as fluff bucket the grinning [cheshire cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Cat) demonstrates on their CV shown in figure \@ref(fig:bigname-fig). üòª

```{r bigname-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbigname)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Big Name.png")
```
(ref:captionbigname) It's easier than you  might think to get a big name on your CV, sometimes these can help your application stand out from the competition. Big name sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Other ways to get a big name on your CV include joining a big name competition or event, for example:

* Amazon hosts the Alexa challenge, see [developer.amazon.com/alexaprize](https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize/challenges/current-challenge/rules) and the AWS Educate Challenge [aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/university-challenge](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/university-challenge/)
* Apple hosts the Swift Student Challenge [developer.apple.com/wwdc22/swift-student-challenge/](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/swift-student-challenge/)
<!--* CERN publishes data at [opendata.cern.ch](https://opendata.cern.ch/)-->
* The European Space Agency (ESA) organises the CANSAT competition (satellite in a can) see [esa.int/Education/CanSat](https://www.esa.int/Education/CanSat) and [cansatcompetition.com](http://www.cansatcompetition.com/) (NASA)
* Facebook has hackathons, see [facebook.com/hackathon](https://en-gb.facebook.com/hackathon) and [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/)
* Google hosts several events including:
    + Code Jam, HashCode and Kick Start [codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/)
    + Summer of Code [summerofcode.withgoogle.com](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), see figure \@ref(fig:gsoc-fig) [@gsoc]
    + Developer Student Club Leads [developers.google.com/community/dsc/leads](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc/leads)
    + Inside Look [buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/inside-look](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/inside-look/)
* [Outreachy.org](https://www.outreachy.org/) provides internships form people subject to systemic bias and underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living, and is backed by big employers.
* IBM hosts the annual Call for Code [developer.ibm.com/callforcode](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode) unlike other competitions, these have a [corporate social responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility) (CSR) themes for the benefit of society at large
* Microsoft hosts the Imagine Cup [imaginecup.microsoft.com](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/) and also has hands on learning paths at [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/)
* There are many other big employers that sponsor competitions, you can find them listed at [devpost.com](https://devpost.com), Major League Hacking [mlh.io](https://mlh.io/) and Hacker Earth [hackerearth.com](https://www.hackerearth.com/) etc

```{r gsoc-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongsoc)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gsoc.jpeg")
```
(ref:captiongsoc) Large well known organisations like Google have a range of schemes and competitions that allow you to get their name on your CV, without working for them directly as an employee. Google Summer of Code [summerofcode.withgoogle.com](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is just one example, where students get paid to write [free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) (FOSS). [@gsoc]


Big names can look good on your CV, but they are not the only way to make your CV stand out.

### Small name experience {#smallnames}

Any experience will help your CV stand out. Smaller employers have the advantage that they tend to be less picky than big names so it is often easier to get a foot in the door. It might not be what you see yourself doing for long, but the experience gained in a small company can be invaluable. You might even prefer working in a small company to a big corporation or conglomeration.

### Open source experience {#opensource}
Open source software projects are a great way to get some solid experience of software engineering, see for example [Why Computing Students Should Contribute to Open Source Software Projects](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/7/253459-why-computing-students-should-contribute-to-open-source-software-projects/fulltext). [@Spinellis] There's two ways to get started:

1. Raise a new issue via the project's issue tracker, such as [github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) [@githubissues]
1. [Fix a bug](https://dev.to/rose/fixing-a-bug-on-my-open-source-project-from-start-to-finish-1749) by picking existing issues. [@fixabug] It might sound trivial, but fixing a bug demonstrates that you can collaborate with others, understand the architecture and toolchain being used (which might be complex) and solve problems. See [firstcontributions.github.io](https://firstcontributions.github.io/) and the `<good first issue>` tag which helps new contributors identify starting points, see [goodfirstissue.dev](https://goodfirstissue.dev/) for some aggregated examples.

There are lots of different motivations for getting involved in open source, shown in figure \@ref(fig:opensource-fig). Whatever your motivation, contributing to open source software is fun, you'll learn heaps and it will look *great* on your CV. Open source software is widely used by, so contributing is a great way to get some real world experience of software development. Many open source projects are funded by employers both large and small, and you can get paid to develop open source software through projects like Google's Summer of Code. [@gsoc]

```{r opensource-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionopensource)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/OS-contribution-motivations-1200x675.png")
```
(ref:captionopensource) There are lots of good reasons for getting involved in open source software, gaining skills and experience of real software engineering in the wild is just one of them. [Open Source Motivations](https://bryanmmathers.com/open-source-motivations) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

If you're looking for a project to get stuck into, here are [Diomidis Spinellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diomidis_Spinellis) tips for getting started [@Spinellis]:

1. Choose a project with several active contributors, so that there is a community to help you
1. Choose a relatively popular project (with some GitHub stars) so that you can avoid [abandonware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware) but...
1. ... Avoid ‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù  projects like [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow) or [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) , so that your contributions will not get lost in the politics and bureaucracy of a large project
1. Verify that you can build and run the project from your own setup
1. Ensure the project regularly accepts pull requests from outsiders, so that your contributions will have a chance of being accepted
1. Contribute a trivial fix to start with to test your ability use the project's workflows

The guidelines for prospective contributors to Google's Summer of Code (GSoC) at [google.github.io/gsocguides/student](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) go into more depth about how you can get involved in open source software development. Many of these general guidelines apply both inside (paid) and outside (unpaid) of GSoC. [@gsoc]

### Voluntary experience {#volunteering}

Experience as a section of your CV usually means *paid* work. However, experience in the context of this chapter means anything where you can show you've been part of a bigger team, taken responsibility for something or tried to make the world a better place somehow. These include:

* Volunteering: Doing voluntary work is a good way to pick up new skills
* Being involved in societies: e.g. taking responsibility for things in a society
* Getting involved in a community, either physical or online


### Casual experience {#casual}
You may already have experience of paid employment as a casual or part-time worker. This could include jobs such as waiting tables, serving in a bar or working in other areas of hospitality or retail, for example as a Saturday job.

```{r paperboy-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionpaperboy)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Titanic-paperboy-crop.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionpaperboy) Casual and part-time work tell an important story about you on your CV. For example, from the age of 12, I was a [paperboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy), delivering newspapers directly to the doors of paying customers. This demonstrates reliability and work ethic, because I did this in all weathers (sun, wind, rain, snow, hangovers etc) for six years. If you have casual experience like this, don't forget to include it in your CV. Public domain image of the Titanic paperboy, Ned Parfett selling newspapers in London via Wikimedia Commons at [w.wiki/35HA](https://w.wiki/35HA) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238).

It is important to recognise that these jobs have value. Many students make the mistake of overlooking their casual work experience because they discount it as non-technical and ‚Äúlow-skilled‚Äù. In section \@ref(mycvst) we saw that one of the stories you want to tell in your job applications is that you:

1. take responsibility
1. achieve things
1. are nice to have around

Doing casual work can demonstrate all of these things. For example, from the ages of 12 to 18 I was a [paperboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy), except unlike the Titanic paperboy selling newspapers in the street in figure \@ref(fig:paperboy-fig), I delivered newspapers directly to the doors of paying customers every morning. This was not a particularly highly skilled job, but it *does* demonstrate:

1. [work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_ethic): getting up early *every* morning (including Saturdays). Sometimes work is about just turning up everyday!
1. taking responsibility and being reliable
1. understanding the value of money by earning a wage

I've often spoken to students who neglect to tell me about their paid work in retail or hospitality. ‚ÄúBut it's not technical‚Äù they say, ‚Äúit's low skilled and irrelevant‚Äù. However, serving customers demonstrates your ability to provide good customer service and work as part of a team, often under pressure, see figure \@ref(fig:budgens-fig). This is good evidence of the ‚Äúnice to have around‚Äù bit that Jonathan Black refers to [@topnotchcv] and is something your formal education will not typically provide much evidence of. So, don't fall into the trap of discounting the value of casual or part-time labour.

```{r budgens-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbudgens)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/budgens.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionbudgens) Early in your career, casual work in hospitality or retail, such as a supermarket like [Budgens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgens) where I used to work as a teenager, is worth mentioning on your CV. If you have any experience of this kind, make sure you mention it and describe the skills you developed. Think carefully about the verbs you can use to describe casual experience, see chapter \@ref(actioning).

# Computing your future {#computing}

It's difficult to think of any aspect of our lives that hasn't been changed by the invention of the digital programmable computer, just 74 short years ago. Consequently, computing is a crucial skill in a wide range of careers across every sector of business and society. You don't have to have studied Computer Science at University to take advantage of all the exciting opportunities provided by computing. This chapter looks at why computing is a subject for everyone. If you're studying computing, this chapter isn't aimed at you, unless you are struggling to stay motivated with your subject! üë®üèø‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíªüë©üèΩ‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíªüë®üèø‚Äçüíª

```
(ref:captionnotcoding) Computing is much more than coding, this chapter looks at what computing can do for your future. CV work sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

## What you will learn {#ilo6}
Reading this chapter and doing the activities will help you to:

1. Identify where you can get started with computing, if you're not studying computer science as a major part of your degree
1. Describe why NOT studying computer science doesn't necessarily ‚Äúlock you out‚Äù of computing as a career

<!--* Describe why computing is a stimulating and challenging subject to study in its own right
* Identify creative opportunities in computing, whatever your background-->



But why should everyone be studying computing? There are social and economic arguments:

## Computing is for everybody {#creative}

At school, everyone learns to read, write and do maths. These are sometimes known as [the three Rs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_three_Rs) but:

* Why did you learn to read and write? Was it so that you could become a professional writer?
* Why did you study mathematics? Was it so that you could become a professional mathematician?

Of course not, that would be ludicrous! You learned to read and write because they are fundamental tools for expressing yourself and communicating with other people. You studied maths so that you could develop numeracy, reason about the world around you, analyse data and solve problems.

So why should everyone learn about computing? Is it so that everyone can become software engineers? Again, this is patently ludicrous.

Everyone should study computing for the same reasons everyone studies maths and english at school. Like writing, computing is one of the most creative tools for expression and communication that we have today. Just like mathematics, studying computing will also help you to solve important problems too. Sam Aaron, creator of [Sonic Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Pi), puts exactly this case for creative computing in his TEDx talk [@youtube-sonicpi] shown in figure \@ref(fig:sonicpi-fig).

```{r sonicpi-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionsonicpi)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/youtube-sonicpi.png")
```
(ref:captionsonicpi) Sam Aaron puts the creative case for computing by discussing programming as performance in his TEDx talk. [@youtube-sonicpi] The image in this figure is a screenshot, [watch the 18 minute video on programming as performance here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lTZ8Tuyu5I).

Computing is also an intellectually stimulating and challenging subject to study in its own right. If you don't believe me, I'm not going to make the case here. Have a look at Silvio Peroni's free computational thinking and programming book at [comp-think.github.io](https://comp-think.github.io/)  which is written for people with a background in the humanities. [@peroni]

## Software is eating your future {#seating}

Whatever future world you enter into after you graduate, there's a good chance it has already been eaten by software. In 2011, the software engineer and billionaire investor [Marc Andreesen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen) outlined why (in his opinion, figure \@ref(fig:eating-fig)) software is eating the world, in *The Wall Street Journal* [@eatingtheworld].

```{r eating-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captioneating)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/software-is-eating-the-world.jpeg")
```
(ref:captioneating) Whatever world you enter after you graduate, software has either eaten it, currently eating it or working out how to do so. Andreessen explains [why software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) and your future with it. Portrait of [Marc Andreesen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen) by JD Lasica on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3V48](https://w.wiki/3V48) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Unfortunately, many people lack the digital skills required to take advantage of all the opportunities provided by software and computing. [Robert Sedgwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)) at Princeton University has, like many others, argued that Computer Science should be a **required** topic of study for *all* undergraduate students in University. [@robertsedgwick] We're not there yet because computing is a subject that has historically been siloed in Computer Science Departments, but this is changing as we'll see in this chapter. It's not that everyone should jump ship to Computer Science, but that:

* Computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists
* [Computing is too important to be left to men](https://www.bcs.org/content-hub/computings-too-important-to-be-left-to-men/) [@sparckjones]

Whatever subject you are currently studying, adding some computing to your education will empower you with the computational thinking skills you need to be an active producer, not just a passive consumer in modern society.

The gist of his argument is that Computer Science is too important to be left to Computer Scientists, because it influences every field of human endeavour.

## Computing is eating the world {#eating}
Besides the social arguments, there are also strong economic reasons for studying computing. It's not just software that's eating the world, but  its combination with hardware that dominates the list of the world's largest corporations by [market capitalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization), shown in figure \@ref(fig:market-fig). What use is software without hardware?

```{r market-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmarket)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Market_Capitalisation.png")
```
(ref:captionmarket) If stock markets are anything to go by, computing is eating the world. It would be impossible for [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Meta (Facebook) to exist without computing. The ten largest corporations by market capitalisation (as of 2021) graphic by YBSLE/[laboussole.coop](https://laboussole.coop/) on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3KEU](https://w.wiki/3KEU)

Even if you don't want to work for any of these global monopolies, their success is good news for *all* students of computing because it shows how important computation is to society, both commercially and otherwise. Another visualisation of data in figure \@ref(fig:market-fig) is shown in figure \@ref(fig:market-again-fig).

```{r market-again-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmarketagain)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Biggest-Companies-in-the-World.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionmarketagain) The Biggest Companies in the World based on market capitalisation data from PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC), as well as the countries and sectors they are from. Again, note the dominance of software and hardware: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (that's Google), Facebook and Amazon. Visualisation by the visualcapitalist.com at [The Biggest Companies in the World in 2021](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-biggest-companies-in-the-world-in-2021/) [@visualcap]

What figure \@ref(fig:market-fig) and figure \@ref(fig:market-again-fig) show is that computing is eating the stock market. This means that commercial demand for software developers is high, comparable to teaching and nursing in terms of raw numbers. In the UK, the most common jobs for graduates from 2019 are shown in figure \@ref(fig:nurses-fig), based on data taken from an [update on the graduate labour market in 2022](https://luminate.prospects.ac.uk/uk-graduate-labour-market-update-11-january) [@labourmarket2022]

(ref:captionball) The top ten professions in the UK in 2019 based on numbers of graduates starting work, shown on the x axis. In 2019, 4340 graduates started a job in the UK job as a software developer (or programmer), with many developer vacancies unfilled. So, demand for software developers is high, comparable to teachers and nurses, according to data published by prospects.ac.uk [@labourmarket2022]

So if you can develop software, there's lots of choice and opportunities on offer. Although the data in figure \@ref(fig:nurses-fig) is from the UK, the story is the same in many other countries around the world. Demand for developers is high, with many vacancies going unfilled.

## Passive consumer or active producer? {#passive}
All this choice is a great thing but what sort of role do you want computing to play in your career? You can either be a passive consumer of computing or you can be an active producer, shaping the world of computing to get want you want from it, rather than what it wants from you. Going back to Andreesen's eating analogy in section \@ref(seating), the choice is to be an *eater* or be *eaten*. Or to use a gaming analogy, *play* or be *played*.

## Play your joker: Computational joker {#joker}
Because of its social and economic importance, computing also gives you flexible career options. If academic disciplines are [playing card suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card_suit), then Computer Science is the [joker in the pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(playing_card)) shown in figure \@ref(fig:joker-fig). A versatile card, the computational joker can be played with (and without) *any* of the traditional four suits: diamonds, clubs, hearts and spades. That's because computing is a science *and* an art. It allows us to study human society and culture, so it's part of the [humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities) too (see [digital humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities) and [computational social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science) for example). Last but not least, computing is also an engineering discipline and a branch of mathematics too. What all this means is that the computational joker is a [wild card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(cards)) that can be played *whenever and wherever* you like, making it an incredibly powerful but dangerous card, depending on the game you are playing (see chapter \@ref(broadening)). ‚ô£‚ô•‚ô†‚ô¶üÉè

```{r joker-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionjoker)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wikijoker.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionjoker) If academic disciplines are playing card suits then Computer Science is the joker in the pack. Just like computing, the joker can be an extremely beneficial card, or an extremely harmful one. Public domain image of the Jolly Joker, a vintage Masenghini Italian playing card via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/35EW](https://w.wiki/35EW) adapted from the [joker playing card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(playing_card)) using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238).

The flexibility of computing as a career means you have a broad range of options on where you can apply your computational skills. You don't *have* to be studying Computer Science to take advantage of these opportunities, but it helps.

## Google Summer of Code

see
https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-advice

and also

look
advice via  Bujanca:

1. Read the entire GSoC site including materials
1. What computer science subject area or specific issue or problem interests you? What are your skills? What languages do you know? What tools are you familiar with?
1. Look through the list of organisations. There's a lot of them, it might be slightly overwhelming, but you'll need to narrow it down. Pick at most 5 of them. You won't have time to look at all of them in depth so follow your interests and gut feeling.
1. Visit the org's site and repos. Look at the code, look at feature requests, issues and bug reports

* Look at the past projects of those 5. It'll become clear that some of them are generally very competitive and usually take final year or masters students for their projects. Narrow it down to 3 organisations.

1. Start engaging with mentors and other students or the community around those 3 organisations. Again, it'll become clear which projects within each organisation are the most popular. Ask for advice. Read project descriptions and draft lists of questions.
1. By the time the student application period begins, you should know which organisation you are going for, even if you're not sure about the project yet.
1. As soon as you picked a project, start working on your proposal, and start asking for feedback early on. You don't have to have a finished proposal to ask for feedback, mentors are more often than not willing to guide you.
1. Your proposal has to highlight two things well: how your background and experience are relevant to the project, and your understanding of the project. The understanding of the project part is crucial: successful applicants usually have a draft timeline. Given that there are 12 weeks, you are expected to mention what you expect to be doing each week. Importantly, after each 4 weeks, you'll have a review / milestone. Make sure it's very clear what your milestones will be.
1. Optional: if you are proposing your own project rather than picking one proposed by the organisation, you'll need to convince the organisation that your idea brings them more value than what they've already proposed. This will require a good understanding of the scope of the organisation and isn't always easy.-->

# (PART) TESTING & BUILDING {-}

# Debugging your future {#debugging}

It's all very well *designing* your future but now you need to actually engineer it by *testing* and *building*. An obvious place to start is with your CV or r√©sum√©, because that's where most people get going. How can you create a bug-free CV, r√©sum√© or completed application form? How can you support applications with a strong personal statement or covering letter? These documents are crucial part of your future so how can you debug them? üêõ


```{r bugfeature-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbuggingcv)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Features not bugs.png")
```

(ref:captionbuggingcv) Is that a bug or a feature in your CV? To stand a chance of being invited to interview, you'll need to identify and fix any bugs in your written applications. If you don't, your application risks being sucked into a black hole and will never be seen again.

## What you will learn {#ilo7}  

By the end of this chapter you will be able to

1. Structure and style the content of your CV and r√©sum√© appropriately
1. Articulate your story^[actually a collection of short stories] as evidenced by your `experience`, `projects` and `education` etc
1. Identify and fix bugs in CV‚Äôs by:
    + Constructively criticising other people's CVs
    + Asking for, listening to, and acting on constructive criticism of your own CV
1. Quantify and provide convincing evidence for any claims you make you on your CV
1. Identify gaps is your CV and how you might begin to fill them


## Beware of the black hole {#blackhole}  
Before we get started, let's consider some advice from software engineer [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell). Gayle is an experienced software engineer who has worked at some of the [biggest technology employers in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech): Apple, Microsoft and Google. She has also authored a cracking series of books on technology careers, particularly *[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_the_Coding_Interview)* [@cracking] which we'll discusses in chapter \@ref(speaking). Gayle refers to the employer ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù described in figure \@ref(fig:gayle-fig).

```{r gayle-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongayle)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gayle-black-hole.jpeg")
```
(ref:captiongayle) Beware of what software engineer [Gayle Laakmaan McDowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell) calls the employer ‚ÄúBlack Hole‚Äù, especially if you're applying to large employers. ‚ÄúGetting through the doors, unfortunately, seems insurmountable. Hoards of candidates submit r√©sum√©s each year, with only a small fraction getting an interview. The online application system ‚Äì or, as it‚Äôs more appropriately nicknamed, *The Black Hole*, ‚Äì is littered with so many r√©sum√©s that even a top candidate would struggle to stand out.‚Äù [@blackhole; @techcareer] Laakmann portrait by Gayle Laakmaan is licensed CC BY 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/wiu](https://w.wiki/wiu) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238) Thank you Gayle for permission to use your photo.

If you're applying to big employers, you'll need to create a CV that is good enough to stand out before it disappears over the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon) and into an employers black hole, see section \@ref(rejection). Your CV or r√©sum√© needs to be good enough to persuade an employer to invite you to an interview. You can start with an employer-agnostic CV but you may need to come back and revisit the issues in this chapter once you have identified some target employers, so that you can customise and tailor your CV and written applications.

## The CV is dead, long live the CV! {#dead}  
R√©sum√©s and CV's have reigned supreme in kingdom of employment and recruitment for many years but their demise has often been predicted, see figure \@ref(fig:longlive-fig).

```{r longlive-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionlonglive)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/the-king-is-dead.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionlonglive) The seemingly contradictory phrase [the king is dead, long live the king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_king_is_dead,_long_live_the_king!) simultaneously announces the death of the previous monarch and the accession of a new one. Likewise, the death of the CV (and r√©sum√©) has long been hailed but it keeps coming back to reign again. The CV is dead, long live the CV! The r√©sum√© is dead, long live the r√©sum√©! Public domain image of a painting of [Charles VII of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VII_of_France) by Jean Fouquet on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3e3K](https://w.wiki/3e3K) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

While it is true that some employers don't accept CVs or favour online application forms or digital profiles, it is still worth writing a CV because:

* Your CV provides a record for you of relevant things you've done
* Your CV enables you to get your story straight, *What's your story, coding glory?* see section \@ref(story) [@whatsthestory]
* Your CV forces you to articulate who you are and what you want, see chapter \@ref(knowing)
* Some employers will still ask you for one, see section \@ref(robotproof) and figure \@ref(fig:longlive-fig)
* Your CV helps you script and practice your ‚Äúlines‚Äù for interviews, see chapter \@ref(speaking)

Even if an employer never asks you for your CV, you'll frequently want to use the *content* of your CV in applications and interviews. So this chapter looks at how you can debug your written applications, whatever the mechanism is for submitting them.

You can of course *augment* your CV with various public digital profiles such as LinkedIn, Github etc. A public digital profile can help employers find you, see section \@ref(generaljobs).

*Wherever* you're putting information about yourself for potential employers, on a CV, R√©sum√©, LinkedIn profile the same principles apply. See the checklist in section \@ref(checklist) and for specific advice on LinkedIn see:

* [linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students](https://linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students)

## It's not bug, it's a feature! {#trope}

It's an age old trope in Computer Science that engineers use to cover their mistakes, passing off their accidental bugs as deliberate features of their work, see \@ref(fig:notabug-fig).

>  ‚ÄúIt's not a *bug*, it's a *feature*...‚Äù ‚ÄîA. Hacker

(ref:captionnotabug) Do you have [software bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) or [undocumented features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undocumented_feature) on your CV or r√©sum√©? Although tolerated in software, bugs in your CV, r√©sum√© and written applications can be fatal.

Nobody likes buggy software, but unfortunately we routinely have to tolerate badly-designed, low quality, bug-ridden software in our everyday lives. [@badsoftware; @failware]

In contrast, buggy CVs are rarely tolerated, they will usually end up in the bin. Even a tiny defect, like an innocent typo, can be ~~fetal~~ fatal. Most employers (particularly large and well known ones) have to triage hundreds or even thousands of CV's for any given vacancy. This means the person reading your CV is as likely to be looking for reasons to `REJECT` your CV, than `ACCEPT` it, because that's a sensible strategy for shortlisting from a huge pool of candidates. A buggy CV, application and covering letter could ruin your chances of being invited to an interview, see chapter \@ref(speaking).

<!-- false positives and false negatives-->

<!--see e.g. https://community.rstudio.com/t/appending-a-pre-existing-pdf-to-a-new-created-by-r-markdown/45641

```{r marissa-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "this is a sample CV"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/marissa.png")
```
-->

Like writing software, the challenging part of writing a CV isn't the *creation* but in the *debugging* and subsequent re-writing. Can you identify and fix the bugs before they are fatal?

<!--## Debug their CV {#bugfeature} It's difficult to be objective about your own CV.-->

::: {.rmdcaution}

(ref:codingcaution)

If you ask three people what they think of your CV, you will get three different and probably contradictory opinions. CV's are very subjective and very personal. The advice in this chapter is based on common sense, experience and ongoing conversations with employers. What makes a good CV will depend on the personal preferences and prejudices of your reader. So, this chapter just describes some general debugging guidelines, rather than rigid rules.

It is good practice to *triangulate* responses from your readers. For example, if three different people point out the same bug in your CV you can be confident that it is a bug that needs fixing.

:::

While referring to this guide, remember that:

* The main purpose of your CV is to get an interview, not a job. Your CV should catch attention and provide talking points for an interview
* Your CV will be assessed in seconds, rather than minutes so brevity really is key
* Bullet points with verbs first (see section \@ref(verbsfirst)) will:
  + allow your reader to quickly scan your CV ([employers don't read CVs, they scan them](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/how-people-read/)) [@scanning]
  + highlight your key activities
  + avoid long sections of flowery [prose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose) which the reader will very probably skip anyway. Instead, you can use your beautiful prose on your covering letters or personal statements, see section \@ref(we3qs)

You're not trying to tell your *whole* life story from section \@ref(story) but to distill the essentials into several short stories which can be summarised into a handful of bullets or sentences. It's a bit like the [blurb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurb) or synopsis on the back of novel, can you entice the reader into wanting to find out more?

## Is it a bug or a feature? {#mycv}

Wherever criticism of your CV comes from, don't take it personally - it is probably one of the first you have written. Think of your current CV as an alpha or beta version that you continuously test, release and redeploy. There are many chances to debug and improve your CV during your study but before potential employers read it. The aim of this chapter is to help you improve your CV, whatever stage you are at. Employers often grumble that Computer Science graduates lack written communication skills. Written applications and CV's are a common example of this.

<!-- this repeats the checklist at the end and needs moving-->
1. **EDUCATION**: Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) degree classification clear? Have you mentioned things you are studying now, not just courses you have finished? See section \@ref(mycved)
1. **STYLE**: Does it look good, decent layout, appropriate use of [LaTeX](https://latex4year1.netlify.app/) or Word or whatever? Are there any spelling mistakes, typos and grammar? Don't just rely on a spellchecker, some typos can only be ~~spitted~~ spotted by a human reader see section \@ref(spelling)
1. **LENGTH**: Does it fit comfortably on (ideally) one page (for a R√©sum√©) or two pages (for a CV)? See section \@ref(length)
1. **STRUCTURE**: Is the structure sensible? Is it in reverse chronological order? Most important (usually recent) things first? Not too many sections or anything missing? See section \@ref(mycvst)
1. **VERBS FIRST**: Have you talked about what you have actually done using prominent `verbs`, rather than just what you think you know? Avoid long sections of [prose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose), see section \@ref(verbsfirst)
1. **RESULTS**: Have you also demonstrated and *quantified* the outcomes of your actions where possible, see Context, Action, Result \& Evidence (`C.A.R.E.`) in section \@ref(care)
1. **SEE ALSO**: This is just a quick checklist, see the longer CV checklist in section \@ref(checklist)

## Structure your CV {#mycvst}

How you structure your CV will depend on who you are and what your story is. Recruiters at Google suggest four or five sections, that follow a header section. Before we look at those, lets look at some general points about CVs, watch the videos shown in Figure \@ref(fig:lopez-fig).

```{r lopez-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongooglerecruiters)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/youtube-google-recruiters.png")
```

(ref:captiongooglerecruiters) Recruiters at Google, [Jeremy Ong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-ong/) and [Lizi Lopez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizilopez/) outline some tips and advice for creating your r√©sum√©. [@youtube-google-recruiters] The image in this figure is a screenshot, you can watch the eight minute r√©sum√© tips video at [youtu.be/BYUy1yvjHxE](https://youtu.be/BYUy1yvjHxE).

<!-- this doesn't really fit here in structure, is there somewhere better? -->
As Jonathan Black, director of the careers service at the University of Oxford has pointed out, [@topnotchcv] a key part of your story that you want to communicate in your CV is that you :

1. take responsibility
1. achieve things
1. are nice to have around

How can you demonstrate this? Watch the short video in Figure \@ref(fig:black-fig).

<!--Remember that no applicant meets all the criteria, so 80% means you're doing really well [@topnotchcv]-->
```{r black-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionjonathanblack)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/youtube-jonathan-black.png")
```
(ref:captionjonathanblack) [Jonathan Black](https://twitter.com/jonathanpblack), head of the careers service at the University of Oxford,  explains how to create a top notch CV by replacing meaningless assertions with meaningful evidence. [@topnotchcv] The image in this figure is a screenshot, you can watch the 11 minute video on creating a top notch CV at [youtu.be/yjdvCHWVtE4](https://youtu.be/yjdvCHWVtE4).

<!-- if moving this to a new section move reference from big bad buglist to mycvst -->
Quantifying and providing evidence for any claims you make will make your CV much more convincing. This can turn meaningless assertions described in figure \@ref(fig:black-fig) into meaningful evidence. So for example:

```md
* Achieved excellent results
```

...is a bit vague, what were the results exactly, can you measure them somehow? Or at least describe them?

```md
* Worked in a team
```

So you worked in a team? `Worked` is vague. What was your role and contribution exactly? How long did the project last? How many people were on your team?  What was the result of your action? What's the story, coding glory? [@whatsthestory]

### Your header {#mycvpd}

The first thing in your CV is the header, a simple section giving your name, email, phone number and any links shown in the CV in figure \@ref(fig:turinghead-fig) for Alan Turing. That's it!

```{r turinghead-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captioncvheader)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/alan-turing-header.png")
```

(ref:captioncvheader) Keep the header of your CV simple like Alan's example here. Just your name, email, phone number and any relevant links (such as [enwp.org/Alan_Turing](https://enwp.org/Alan_Turing) for example) are all you really need. Any additional information risks wasting valuable space and distracting your reader. Less is more.

Your header doesn't need to include any more information than your name, email, phone and any links. This means your birth date, marital status, photo^[different countries have different conventions when it comes to passport-style photos on a CV. In the UK what you look like should *not* be a factor in an employers decision to interview you, so leave it out] and home address aren't relevant and you don't need to give multiple phone numbers or emails either, just one of each will do. If an employer wants to invite you to an interview, they'll get in touch by email, phone (or possibly LinkedIn, github etc) so other contact details such as your postal address are an irrelevant distraction at this point. After your header I suggest you have about five sections that cover some or all of the following:

1. üéì `Education`: the formal stuff, see section \@ref(mycved)
1. üí∞ `Experience`: paid work, see section \@ref(mycvex)
1. üí™ `Projects`: personal, school, social, side or University projects see section \@ref(mycvpj)
1. üèÜ `Leadership and awards`: see section \@ref(prizes)
1. ‚ùì `Optional`: but don't call it that, see section \@ref(misc)

Let's look at each of these sections in turn:  

### Your education {#mycved}

Unless you have significant amount of experience, the `EDUCATION` section of your CV is likely to be the first real section, after the header. Your education section needs to strike a balance between:

* Describing in enough detail what you've studied and any projects you've completed at University as part of your formal education
* Keeping it short and sweet by avoiding getting bogged down in tedious details

You've invested a significant amount of time and money in getting your degree. At this stage, your degree justifies more description than a terse one line `BSc Computer Science`. You'll need to:

* say *more* than [Pen Tester](Penelope_Tester.pdf) and [Rick Urshion](Rick_Urshion.pdf), who haven't said enough about their University education
* say *less* than [Mike Rokernel](Mike_Rokernel.pdf), who has given *way* too much information on his degree.

You don't need to name every single module and give a mark for each. Neither do you need to give your result to FOUR or FIVE significant figures: `71.587%`^[Do you *really* think academic performance can be measured that precisely?]. Two significant figures will do just fine: `72% (first class)`. You might like to pick out relevant modules, or the ones you enjoyed most. Employers like Google encourage applicants to emphasise courses on data structures and algorithms, but you'll need to tailor your description to the role and be brief. On a one page CV, you might only have two or three lines to describe your higher education. üéì

### Your experience {#mycvex}  

Experience is where you can talk about any paid or voluntary work experience you have. For paid work call it `EXPERIENCE` rather than `WORK EXPERIENCE` as the latter can imply work *shadowing*, see section \@ref(areuexperienced). Work shadowing is valuable, but paid work is even better so you should make it clear if your experience was paid or not. Don't discount the value of casual labour, such as working in retail or hospitality, these demonstrate your work ethic and ability to deal with customers, often under pressure. You are more than just a techie too, so anywhere you've worked in a team is experience worth mentioning, even if that team was just two people. Two people is still a team.

```{r done-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionwhathaveudone)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/What have you done.png")
```

(ref:captionwhathaveudone) Are you experienced? What have you done outside of your formal academic education? Employers will want to know *much more* about you than just your `Education`. Are you `Experienced`? What `Projects` have you done? Can you demonstrate `Leadership`? Have you won any `Awards`?

[@hendrix]

If you don't have much experience, don't worry, there are plenty of opportunities to get some. For details, see chapter \@ref(experiencing) *experiencing your future*.

Are you experienced? Whatever it is, make sure you add it to your `experience` section. üí∞

### Your projects {#mycvpj}

The `PROJECTS` section of your CV is a where you can describe all other things you get up to. These might include:

* personal side projects
* social responsibility projects
* open source projects
* entrepreneurial projects
* University projects (although these *might* fit better in your `Education` section)

Your projects will most likely be unpaid because paid work tends to fit better under the heading `experience`, see section \@ref(mycvex). Perhaps you've completed some courses outside of your education such as a massive open online course  (MOOC) or similar. Hackathons and competitions, fit well here too. [@hafb] You don't *need* to have won any prizes or awards, although be sure to mention them if you have. Participating in hackathons and competitions clearly shows the reader that you enjoy learning new things. Demonstrating an appetite for new knowledge and skills will make your application stand out. If you're looking for some inspiration for side projects, the [codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) repository is a good starting point. Building and creating new things is a great way to understand them, just ask [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) shown in figure \@ref(fig:feynman-fig). What you cannot create you do not understand. One way of doing this is with open source projects which we describe in section \@ref(opensource).


```{r feynman-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfeynman)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/what-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand.jpeg")
```

[@feynmanblackboard] Creating software and hardware in personal side projects is a great way to build new understanding *and* help your CV stand out see [github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x).

Any longer projects you've done at University are worth mentioning. Your projects are important because they differentiate you from everyone else in your year group. Try to be *more* descriptive than this:

```md
* First year team project
```
or perhaps
```md
* Second year team project
```
or even just
```md
* Final year project
```

By themselves, those project names are pretty opaque. They are OK for giving the context of your story but don't give the reader much else to go on. What was the story (the context, action, result and evidence (`CARE`) we described in section \@ref(care)) of those projects? How many people were in your team? How long did you collaborate for? What did you build? What was it called? What did it do? What roles and responsibilities did you have in the team? Was their conflict in the team? How did you resolve it? How did you motivate the free-riders in the team to contribute? This is all excellent CV [fodder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fodder), see \@ref(fig:cvfodder-fig)


```{r cvfodder-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfodder)"}

Difficult projects can make great stories (aka CV [fodder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fodder)) because mistakes *can* be good, see section \@ref(estherdyson), as long as you don't repeat them.

It's often better to describe what YOU did before you describe what the software, hardware or project did. Your reader is much more likely to be interested in the former than the latter. Let's imagine you've developed a piece of software called `WidgetWasher`. You might describe it like this:

````md
* WidgetWasher is a web service that washes widgets
* Makes use of an HTTP API and secret keys
* Tested WidgetWasher on a range of different operating systems
* Collaborated with one other contributor over two days
* Designed and implemented an API
````


Instead, you could reverse the order to change the emphasis like this:

````md
* Designed and implemented an API
* Collaborated with one other contributor over two days
* Tested WidgetWasher on a range of different operating systems
* Makes use of an HTTP API and secret keys
* WidgetWasher is a web service that washes widgets
````

The latter has all the same information, but by reversing the order, you've emphasised what *you* did, rather than what the software did. üí™
<!-- need a section on üëë Activities and leadership -->

### Your leadership & awards {#prizes}
If you can demonstrate leadership, you may want to dedicate a whole separate section for it. If you have experience of tutoring or mentoring other students, perhaps younger ones, make sure you highlight it as leadership. Teaching is a different kind of leadership to running a small business or captaining a sports team, but it is leadership nonetheless.

A `leadership` section is also a good place to add any prizes you've won. If you've been granted any interesting awards or honours be sure to mention them. You'll typically need a bit more than:

```md
* Awarded the Poppleton University scholarship for excellence
```

Congratulations, but how many people were awarded that prize? How many applicants or entrants were there and what percentage were successful? Was it a regional, national or global award? How frequently is the award given? It is unlikely that your reader will have heard of the award unless it is widely known. So if you're going to mention awards, give the context where you can so the reader can understand what the prize was for. üèÜ

### Your optional extras {#misc}
If you have anything else you want to highlight besides your `education`, `experience`, `projects` and `leadership and awards` you *may* still have room for one more optional extras section. Try to come up with a better name than `Miscellaneous` or `Other highlights`, which sound like dumping grounds for the leftovers. You might decide to have a dedicated `skills` section but see section \@ref(mycvsk).

You may opt to have a `hobbies and interests` or `extracurricular` section which can add a bit of colour to what can otherwise become quite a dull list of facts. However, it is debatable how many (if any) hobbies and interests you should list on your CV. For a one-pager you're usually pushed for space and looking for things to edit *out* (rather than add in), so if you're going to list hobbies, I'd stick to those that are relevant to the job or those that demonstrate particular transferrable or soft skills. Organising or participating in team sports is a good example of a relevant hobby as it provides evidence of your teamwork, commitment, reliability etc, see figure \@ref(fig:quidditch-fig). Other collaborative activities outside of sport will also demonstrate your communication skills. [@hobbies]

```{r quidditch-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionquidditch)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Anyone for quidditch.png")
```
(ref:captionquidditch) It is debatable which, if any, of your hobbies should go on your CV. You might get lucky and your interviewer will share your esoteric passion for [Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(real-life_sport)) (say), but it is unlikely. [@quidditch] So if you *do* list your hobbies and interests, think carefully about *WHY* you are mentioning them and *WHAT* skills or knowledge you are trying to demonstrate to potential employers. [Anyone for Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyone_for_tennis%3F) sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

The fact that you enjoy `swimming`, `reading`, `football`, `cooking` and `hiking` is a vague and pretty boring, making it unlikely to be a factor in the decision to invite you to interview. There's nothing *wrong* with these pastimes but there's not much point mentioning them on your CV unless you have, for example:

* coached a swimming team
* trained as a mountain leader
* organised, hosted and participated in a book club
* regularly participated in or organised competitive sports matches (for example)

In this case, the *way* you have engaged with your hobbies demonstrates your communication and leadership skills. So in this context, your hobbies *are* worth talking about if you have any space left. However, if they are just hobbies that enable you to amuse yourself, you should probably leave them out as they are unlikely to be of interest to an employer. Sure, they add colour to your CV, but you've probably got more interesting and important things to say about who you are.

Of course, you *might* get lucky and your interviewer could be intrigued (or even share) your esoteric passion for [Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(real-life_sport)) (say), but you can't rely on it. So, I reckon if you're going to mention hobbies and interests at all then ...

* pick the unusual hobbies that make you unique
* describe the interests that add some colour and personality to your CV
* be specific, e.g. `reading japanese novels from 20th century` might sound more interesting than just `reading`
* highlight any `actions` you've taken, see chapter \@ref(actioning)

... or just leave them out altogether. That option is up to you.‚ùì

### Your skills?  {#mycvsk}

You may be tempted to dedicate a whole section on your CV to `skills`, particularly the technical ones. Maybe it makes you feel good listing them all in one place like a stamp collection. If you're going to have a `skills` section, keep it short. Why? Let's imagine, that like [Rick Urshion](Rick_Urshion.pdf), you include Python in a long list skills, with its own dedicated section. There are at least five problems with Rick's not so skilful approach:

1. ‚ùé **No `Context`** to give the reader an idea of where he's developed or used his Python skills. Was it during his education, as a part of his work experience or his personal projects? We don't know because he doesn't say.  
1. ‚ùé **No `Actions`** to demonstrate what he's *done* with his Python skills. So Rick claims he knows Python. So what? What did use them for? We don't know because he hasn't told us.
1. ‚ùé **No `Results`** given for what the outcome of using the skills was. Did he save his employers some money? Did he make something more efficient? Did he learn some methodology? We will never know.  
1. ‚ùé **No `Evidence`** to support his claims. Perhaps he DOES have Python skills, perhaps he DOESN'T. Is he telling lies and peddling fake news (see section \@ref(oversell))? It's difficult to tell.
1. ‚ùé **No `C.A.R.E.`**  There's no story told for that skill, see figure \@ref(fig:gallagher-fig). This makes for a very dull and boring read. Yawn. NEXT! ü•±

```{r gallagher-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongallagher)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/whats-the-story.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiongallagher) [(What's your Story) ~~Morning~~ Coding Glory?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(What%27s_the_Story)_Morning_Glory%3F) [@whatsthestory] What is the `Context`, the `Actions`, the `Results` and the `Evidence` for the stories that you are trying to tell? Show your `C.A.R.E.` in storytelling. CC BY portrait of [Noel Gallagher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Gallagher) by [alterna2.com](https://alterna2.com/) on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3bimy](https://w.wiki/3bim) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

So, this doesn't mean Rick shouldn't mention his Python skills. Where he can, he needs to give us the context, action, result and evidence (`C.A.R.E.`) of his story described in section \@ref(care). This will make his Python story much more convincing and interesting to read. Showing a bit of C.A.R.E. will improve his chances of being invited to interview.

This applies to soft skills too, not just hard technical skills. Best to mention the context in which you've used any skills you mention on your CV. So, if you're going to have a skill section:

* keep it short (one or two lines maybe) but personally I'd avoid dedicating a whole section to it
* stick to your strongest and most relevant skills that you are comfortable to answer questions on in your interview, rather than an exhaustive encyclop√¶dic inventory
* avoid listing mass marketed office products of Microsoft (e.g. Word etc) as a skill, they are *not* generally very interesting skill because almost *everyone* has them. They won't set you apart much from your competition, so don't waste valuable space talking about office unless you've done something interesting with them, like some advanced integration with other software. Cloud services can be a slightly different matter, see section \@ref(techie).

If you're a computer scientist, you also have demonstrable `meta` skills like the ability to learn things quickly. You can also think logically and critically, reason, problem solve, analyse, generalise, decompose and abstract - often to tight deadlines. These [computational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking) skills are future-proof and will last longer than whatever technology happens to be fashionable right now. Employers are often more interested in these `meta` capabilities and your potential than in any specific technical skills you may or may not have.

## Birds eye view
Having looked at the sections you're likely to have, we'll take a birds eye view of your whole CV. The issues in this section apply to the whole of your CV, rather than individual sections.

### Your style {#pdf}

Making your CV look good can take ages, but a well presented CV will stand out. While its worth making an effort to style carefully and consistently, you need to be be wary of the huge time sink of [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography).

```{r cvwork-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionworkcv)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/CV need a little work.png")
```
(ref:captionworkcv) Does your CV need a little work? The truth is your CV is never finished, you will be continuously developing, debugging and releasing it throughout your life. It's such a crucial document because it will determine if you are invited to interview. Any time you spend getting it right is a good investment. CV work sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Whatever your typographical style is, portable document format (`*.pdf`) is the safest way to deliver it. It's called portable for a reason. While Microsoft Word is fine for editing, it is difficult to ensure that a Word document doesn't get mangled by transmission via the web, email or even Microsoft's own products like Teams! PDF is much safer, you can be more confident that it will work well on a range of different operating systems and devices. Try opening a Word document on any smartphone or tablet and you'll see what I mean. It helps if you can give the file a descriptive name so `ada_lovelace.pdf` is a better filename than `my_cv.pdf`, especially if its being read by a human and not a robot. ü§ñ

It's fine to author your CV in Microsoft Word, but you'll want to save it as a PDF to make it more platform independent. LaTeX and overleaf can be used to create professional PDFs and there are plenty of good templates. See [Getting started with LaTeX (LaTeX4year1)](https://latex4year1.netlify.app/) if you've not used LaTeX before, or you need to refresh your memory. [@latex4year1]

### What's your story, coding glory? {#care}

One way to structure descriptions of items within each section of your CV is to use **C**ontext, **A**ction, **R**esult and **E**vidence (C.A.R.E.) to tell your stories. What's your story, coding glory? [@whatsthestory] The `C.A.R.E.` method can also be useful for structuring answers to interview questions, especially if you get nervous. So for example, rather than just listing `Python` as a skill, you could tell the reader more about the context in which you've used python, what you actually did with it and what the result was. You really need to spell it out.

* **CONTEXT**: So you've used Python, but in what context? As part of your education? For a personal project? As a volunteer? In a competition?
* **ACTION**:  What did you *do* with Python? Did you use some particular library? Did you integrate or model something? What verbs can you use to describe these actions, see chapter \@ref(actioning)
* **RESULT**: What was the result and how can you measure it? You picked up some new skills? What was the impact? Perhaps you made something that was inefficient and awkward into something better, cheaper or faster? Some things are hard to measure but you should quantify results where you can.
* **EVIDENCE**: Where evidence exists, you should highlight it. That could be a quantification, for example describing a result in numbers (see `as measured by` below) or it might be certification described in chapter \@ref(achieving). If you're talking about software, point to a copy online if you can, but beware of plagiarism if you publish university coursework on github. Nothing says ‚ÄúI can build software ...‚Äù quite like ‚Äú ... and here's one I made earlier‚Äù.

You don't have to stick rigidly to the order C.A.R.E. as long as they appear somewhere. For example, recruiters at Google (see figure \@ref(fig:lopez-fig)) advise candidates to describe their experience and projects using this simple pattern:

````md
* Accomplished [X], as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]
````

Where *accomplished* is `Result`, *measured by* is `Evidence` and *doing* is the `Action`. So instead of just saying:

````md
* Generated reports for end users
````

You could say:

````md
* Generated daily reconciliation report for team by automating workflow of 8 different tasks
````

The latter is better because it is more specific, captures the result (`accomplishment`), by giving evidence (`8 different tasks`) and talks about the actions (the `doing` part). Choose the verbs you use carefully, see chapter \@ref(actioning) for examples.


### Your length {#length}
How long should your CV be? Many people start with a two page CV, which is a sensible starting point shown in figure \@ref(fig:oneortwopager-fig). It is also advisable to [create a one page R√©sum√©](https://www.cv-library.co.uk/career-advice/cv/how-long-cv-be/). [@howlong]


```{r oneortwopager-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiononeortwopager)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/youtube-resume-or-cv.png")
```

(ref:captiononeortwopager) How long should your CV be? Should you write a two page European style CV or an American style r√©sum√© (one pager)? [@youtube-resume-or-cv] The image in the figure is a screenshot, you can watch the five minute video on how long your CV should at [youtu.be/0abDOKHS5T0](https://youtu.be/0abDOKHS5T0).

At this stage in your career you *should* be able to fit everything on to one page. However, it can be challenging and time consuming squeezing it all on, see figure \@ref(fig:shorterletter-fig).

```{r shorterletter-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionshorterletter)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/shorterletter.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionshorterletter) I would have written a shorter ~~letter~~, ~~CV~~, R√©sum√© but I did not have the time. This quote (or meme) is frequently attributed to Blaise Pascale's  *[Lettres provinciales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettres_provinciales)* [@shorterletter]. Public domain image by Gallica on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3Uzn](https://w.wiki/3Uzn) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238) üá´üá∑

It takes more time to write less. Writing a one page r√©sum√© is a valuable exercise, because it forces you to distill and edit out any filler or fluff, which you sometimes find on two page undergraduate or graduate CVs. It is much better to have a strong one-page r√©sum√© than a weaker two-page CV that is padded out with filler to make up the space, as described in the video in figure \@ref(fig:oneortwopager-fig). Adding more features (pages and content) to your CV doesn't necessarily make it better. Sometimes adding more features to your CV will make it worse, as shown in figure \@ref(fig:morefeatures-fig).

```{r morefeatures-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmorefeatures)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/an-engineering-state-of-mind.png")
```

(ref:captionmorefeatures) If it ain't broke it doesn't have enough features yet. Adding more features to software doesn't necessarily make it better. Likewise, adding more pages and content to your CV or r√©sum√© won't always improve it. It's often better to be precise and concise, rather than bloated and potentially more buggy. [An engineering state of mind](https://bryanmmathers.com/an-engineering-state-of-mind/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/), with help from Dilbert cartoonist [Scott Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams)

If you're struggling to fit all the information onto a one page r√©sum√©, revisit each section and item carefully. Is there anything you can drop? Can you save a wasteful word here, or a lazy line there? Check for any spurious line breaks because every pixel counts. Don't throw your two page CV away, it is still a good store of stuff you might want to add to customised one-page r√©sum√©s.

### Verbs first: lead with your actions {#verbsfirst}

A simple but effective technique for emphasising what you have done, rather than just what you know, is to start the description of it with a verb. Employers don't just want to know what you know, but what you have actually done. So, for example, instead of saying e.g.

````md
* In my second year CS29328 software engineering module I used Java, Eclipse and JUnit to test and build an open source Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG)
````

you could say:

````md
* Built and tested a large open-source codebase using Eclipse, Ant, JUnit and Jenkins‚Äù
````

followed by:

````md
* Added and deployed new features to a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) in Java
````


The latter examples get to the point much quicker and avoid the problem of using `I, me, my...` too much which can sound self-centred and egotistical. Although your CV is all about you so it is natural to have a few personal pronouns in there, too many can look clumsy and give the wrong impression. Choose the verbs you use carefully, see chapter \@ref(actioning) for examples.

### Your links {#links}

Augmenting your CV with web links (hyperlinks) can add important context to your story, without adding too many words or taking up valuable space. An example using LinkedIn is shown in figure \@ref(fig:lovelace-fig)

```{r lovelace-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionlovelace)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lovelace-linkedin.png")
```
(ref:captionlovelace) Adding links is a good way to augment your CV. If you're adding LinkedIn, make sure you [customise your public profile URL](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/topics/6042/6054/87), (the `.../in/handle`) to remove the default randomly generated alphanumeric string at the end, like the `038b37` example here. [@customlinkedin] You can also remove any ugly `http`, colons `::`, forward slashes  `//`, `www` and trailing `/` in URLs which are distracting noise. Just make sure links are clickable in the pdf, don't 404 if they are followed and work when printed on paper too. Neither do you need to waste valuable space telling people what the link is, like in the first example, the domain name already tells you that it is a LinkedIn profile.

Links can provide `Context`, (Action), `Result` and `Evidence` (see `C.A.R.E.` in section \@ref(care)) by quantifying and substantiating any claims that you make. They can allow your reader to *read between the lines* and make more inferences from the information you've provided them with. For example, you might says things like:

```md

... and so on. So links are crucial features of your CV and an interested reader *may* even follow them. Treat links with respect and they will support your goals and help your readers. Invest some time thinking about how you word the link text, and how they would be understood out of context. Make sure that:

* your hyperlinks are [readable and descriptive](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/links/) [@readable]  
* your hyperlinks are clickable in the PDF. Don't expect your reader to cut and paste (or even type) URLs, they are too busy. If they are clickable, people are much more likely to follow them
* your hyperlinks are paper-proof. Some people still print CVs so the phrase [click here](https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere) won't work well on printed paper. See [to print or not to print ‚Äî a CV, that is](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140620-to-print-or-not-to-print) [@printcv]

Besides LinkedIn you could include public profiles from [github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile), [devpost.com](https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021734632-Update-your-profile-and-username), [hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard) and [stackoverflow](https://medium.com/@rhamedy/contribution-debt-why-how-to-contribute-to-stack-overflow-a69d4bd50d0c) [@stackoverflow]. You can also link to personal projects or your blog if you have one. Obviously, you need to be careful about what you link to and what employers can find out about you online. They *will* Google you. So keep it professional and, as we discussed in a section \@ref(signposts3), be wary of social media.

::: {.rmdnote}
(ref:codingcomment)

LinkedIn is much more than a tool for publishing your CV or r√©sum√© because it also allows you to

* search and apply for jobs
* create a digital portfolio that is publicly available^[you might want to be careful about what information you put out there!]
* connect with professionals, think social media for jobs

Chapter \@ref(finding) looks at job searching in more detail but for now just note the similarities and differences between LinkedIn, CVs and r√©sum√©s outlined in table \@ref(tab:linkedintable). Some of these differences also apply to other places online where you might augment your CV with extra information such as github, devpost and others mentioned in section \@ref(links).

:::

So, LinkedIn can be a useful tool for job hunting but it's a different beast to traditional CV's, some of these differences are shown in table \@ref(tab:linkedintable)

```{r linkedintable, echo = FALSE}
linkedin_table <- tibble::tribble(
    ~ "LinkedIn"                        , ~ "CV or r√©sum√©",     
  "Dynamic document that you can constantly update"    , "Static document, providing a snapshot that can't be updated once you've  sent it",       
  "Generally speaking, no length limit"     , "(ref:lengthcell)",
  "Public or semi-public document, more like social media"    , "Private document, should only be seen by those employers you send it to (anti-social media if you like)",      
  "Only one profile, you can't easily transfer connections if you open more than one account"    , "You might create multiple CV's that emphasise different skills and knowledge, or have different lengths such as a one page r√©sum√© and two page CV",  
  "Generic, allows employers and recruiters to target you"    , "Specific, can be targeted to a given employer or vacancy",  
)
knitr::kable(linkedin_table, caption = "Comparison of LinkedIn with conventional CV's and r√©sum√©s. The two mediums have a lot in common but also provide different communication channels which can be complementary, e.g. you include your LinkedIn profile on your CV to augment it.", booktabs = TRUE)
```

<!--this is a nasty hack to get references into table cells-->
(ref:lengthcell) Limited length, typically one or two pages (for a graduate), see section \@ref(length)  


### Robot proofing your CV {#robotproof}

It's a good idea get feedback from as many different sources as you can on your CV. By *sources* I don't just mean humans, but also robots. Larger employers will use automated [Application Tracking Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) (ATS) to log and trace your application. These ‚Äúr√©sum√© robots‚Äù (if you like) are unlikely to have arms and legs like the one in Figure \@ref(fig:machines-fig), but they *will* be looking for keywords and standard headings in your CV. You can get automated feedback from a range of different automated systems, though it is a good idea to remove any personal information like phone numbers and emails before using these free services. You might also want to check what the services privacy policy says about what they do with your personal data. R√©sum√© robots include:

* [careerset.io](https://careerset.io), a free service provided by a UK based company, careerset Ltd.
<!--* [resume.io](https://resume.io), a free service provided by a Dutch company, Imkey BV not really CV checker-->
* [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co), a free service provided by an American company not reallly a CV checker
* [google.com/search?q=resume+checker](https://www.google.com/search?q=resume+checker)
* [google.com/search?q=CV+checker](https://www.google.com/search?q=cv+checker)


```{r machines-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmachines)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/The-inevitable-rise-of-the-machines-1280x720.png")
```

(ref:captionmachines) Just like the [daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) in [Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who), r√©sum√© robots often struggle to get up the stairs. Although they typically don't have arms, legs (or even wheels) robots are likely to play an important role in decisions made about if you are worth interviewing, especially if you're applying to bigger companies. Make sure your CV is r√©sum√© robot friendly by getting feedback from a robot. [Machines](https://bryanmmathers.com/machines/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Besides providing feedback on the content of your CV, using these systems can help address issues such as the use of tables or layout which may cause problems for some systems. For example, some systems ignore the second column of a two-column CV because they can't parse the [PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript) to identify columns. Some things to check with automated CV screens:

* Have you used standard headings for the sections? Non-standard sections maybe ignored or misunderstood
* Have you used appropriate verbs to describe your actions?
* Is your layout and design robot friendly? Sometimes tables and two column layouts can get horribly mangled, see [what happens to tables and columns in an applicant tracking system](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/resume-tables-columns-ats/) [@jobscan]

### Spellchecking {#spelling}
Bots, grammar and spell checkers will improve your CV but you can't rely on automated help completely. The r√©sum√© robots described in section \@ref(robotproof) will just encode the biases and prejudices of whoever wrote their algorithms. Spellcheckers can't be relied on completely either, as shown in the poem below:

```

Eye halve a spelling checker
It came with my pea sea
It plainly marques four my revue
Miss steaks eye kin knot sea

Eye strike a key and type a word
And weight for it to say
Weather eye am wrong oar write
It shows me strait a weigh

As soon as a mist ache is maid
It nose bee fore two long
And eye can put the error rite
Its rare lea ever wrong

Eye have run this poem threw it
I am shore your pleased two no
Its letter perfect awl the weigh
My chequer told me sew

---Anon
```

While automation can help improve your writing, ultimately there is no substitute for *humans* reading your CV, and the more people that read it the better. This could be potential employers, your critical friends shown in figure \@ref(fig:wonderfuldarling-fig) or just reading it **out loud** to yourself described in section \@ref(dogfooding).


### Your references {#referees}

You might be tempted to put your referees details on your r√©sum√©. Don't bother because;

* references waste valuable space. You can say much more interesting things about yourself than who you referees are
* references aren't needed in the early stages of a job application anyway. Employers typically ask for your referees *much* later, when you've been offered or are about to be offered the job
* references disclose personal information. Do you really want to be giving personal details out to anyone that reads your CV? It could easily be misused.

It's not even worth saying `references available on request` - that just wastes space as well and is implied information on every CV anyway.

## Checklist: Big Bad Bugs {#checklist}

Here is a quick check-list for debugging your CV before you send it off to an employer:

1. ‚úÖ Does it fit comfortably on exactly one page (r√©sum√©) or two pages (CV)? Definitely not one-and-a-half pages or more than two? See section \@ref(length)
1. ‚úÖ Does the style look good? Is it easy on the eye? Is there adequate whitespace, not too much (gappy) or too little (cramped)? See section \@ref(pdf) <!-- merge with previous-->
1. ‚úÖ Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) overall degree classification clear? See section \@ref(mycved)
1. ‚úÖ Have you eaten your own dogfood (woof), see section \@ref(dogfooding)? Is *everything* relevant? e.g. no swimming certificates from ten years ago?
1. ‚úÖ Have you spell-checked using both automatic and manual (proof-reading) techniques? See section \@ref(spelling).
1. ‚úÖ Have you got a second opinion from a ‚Äúr√©sum√© robot‚Äù? Is it robot proof? See section \@ref(robotproof) ü§ñ
1. ‚úÖ Have you added context using relevant hyperlinks that an interested reader can click on? See section \@ref(links)
1. ‚úÖ Is it in reverse chronological order? Most recent things first. Can your timeline be easily scanned, with all dates clearly aligned for easy reading? See [Neil Pointer](https://www.cdyf.me/Neil_Pointer.pdf) as an example with a clear timeline using right-aligned dates.
1. ‚úÖ Have you avoided using too many personal pronouns? `I, me, my ...` everywhere? See section \@ref(verbsfirst)
1. ‚úÖ Have you made it clear what you have actually done using **prominent** `verbs`? See chapter \@ref(actioning)
1. ‚úÖ Have you given sufficient information on your education without going into too much detail? Have you mentioned courses you are studying now (*and* next semester)? See section \@ref(mycved)
1. ‚úÖ Have you **quantified** and evidenced the claims you have made where you can? See section \@ref(mycvst)
1. ‚úÖ Is it balanced, including both technical and non-technical (softer) skills? See section \@ref(casual)
1. ‚úÖ Does it have a good, clear structure? Not too many headings, around five sections for a one-pager see section \@ref(mycvpd)?
1. ‚úÖ Have you clearly distinguished between paid, unpaid and voluntary `experience`? Have you done the same for your `projects`, see section \@ref(mycvpj)? Have you included *all* of the relevant experience that you can fit on including casual work, see section \@ref(casual)?
1. ‚úÖ Has your CV been reviewed by other people? Do a CV swap with a critical friend (see figure \@ref(fig:wonderfuldarling-fig)) and score each others CV's using [this rubric](https://www.cdyf.me/CV-rubric.pdf). This is a bit like [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). According to [Linus's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) ‚Äúgiven enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow‚Äù [@Raymond1999] so the more people who give you feedback the better
1. ‚úÖ Have you reviewed other people's CV's? This will put you in the shoes of an employer or recruiter, thereby helping you to write a better CV yourself. See the examples in chapter \@ref(hacking). Who would *you* want to interview and why?

```{r wonderfuldarling-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionwonderfuldarling)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Critical Friend.png")
```

(ref:captionwonderfuldarling) Showing your CV to somebody else is one of the best ways to debug it. You need to find a [critical friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_friend), somebody who won't just tear it apart (`hostile witness`) or tell you it's simply *wonderful* darling (`uncritical lover`) but tell you how to improve it, whatever state it is in (`critical friend`).

## Covering letters & personal statements {#we3qs}
Applications and CV's are often accompanied by covering letters or include some kind of personal statement. Whereas a lot of your CV is essentially a bulleted list of facts and statements, a covering letter or personal statement gives you a chance to *really* demonstrate your fluent written communication skills in clear [prose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose). If you're going to have a `personal statement` or `profile` on your CV keep it short, unlike [Mike Rokernel](https://www.cdyf.me/mike_rokernel.pdf) who waffles on for ages without providing any evidence. Usually this kind of information is better in your covering letter.

Let's say you're applying for a widget engineering position at `widget.com`. There are three things you need to cover in this order:

1. **Why them?** Why are you applying to `widget.com`
1. **Why that role?**  Employees of `widget.com` have many roles and responsibilities but what is it about `widget engineering` (say) that attracts you?
1. **Why you?** Why should `widget.com` employ you? What skills and experience make you stand out from all the other candidate widget engineerings? What are your Unique Selling Points (USPs)? Say why *you* would be good for *them* (**not** why widget.com would be good for you and your career).

You can see some examples of answers to these questions at:

* [prospects.ac.uk/careers-advice/cvs-and-cover-letters/cover-letters/sample-cover-letter](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/careers-advice/cvs-and-cover-letters/cover-letters/sample-cover-letter)
* [targetjobs.co.uk/cv-and-cover-letter-templates](https://targetjobs.co.uk/cv-and-cover-letter-templates)
*  [www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/cl](https://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/cl/)


### Does anyone actually READ covering letters? {#elevatorpitch}
Some employers will read your covering letter very carefully, others less so. It is not always clear which employers will bother and which won't.

Even if *nobody* reads your covering letter, it is still worth writing one because formulating answers to the three basic questions in section \@ref(we3qs) will force you to rehearse standard interview questions.

Think of your covering letter as practicing some of the lines of your [elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch).

## Debugging summary {#tldr7}
(ref:tldr)

## Where can you for look for jobs? {#looking}

The marketplace for job searching and job hunting advice is incredibly crowded. Employers spend huge amounts of money on recruitment and this is reflected in the enormous range of job websites, which are often accompanied by advice on job hunting. There are three kinds of places you can look for jobs:


1. Undergraduate and graduate jobs boards, such as Gradcracker \@ref(studentjobs)
1. General jobs boards, such as Google jobs see section \@ref(generaljobs)
1. Portfolio style, such as LinkedIn and Github etc, see \@ref(generaljobs)
1. The jobs portal of your University, see \@ref(studentjobs)

### Student and graduate specific resources {#studentjobs}

The following job finding resources are specifically aimed at undergraduate students and graduates:

* [aws.amazon.com/education](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/aws-educate-job-board/) has a dedicated jobs board for students with (or working towards) Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing qualifications
* [gradcracker.com](http://www.gradcracker.com/) for engineering and technology students, you can filter e.g. by [Computing/Technology jobs](https://www.gradcracker.com/search/computing-technology/jobs), from the publishers of the popular [gradcracker toolkit](http://www.gradcracker.com/career-centre/toolkit)
* [ratemyplacement.co.uk](http://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/) is a leading UK job resource for undergraduates seeking placements and internships.
* [targetjobs.co.uk](http://www.targetjobs.co.uk/) graduate jobs, schemes and internships from the people behind [The Guardian 300 top graduate employers](https://targetjobs.co.uk/uk300)
* [milkround.com](http://www.milkround.com/), placements and graduate positions from the people behind [The Times Top 100 Graduate employers](https://digital.top100graduateemployers.com/view/979434180/)
*  [graduateland.com](https://graduateland.com/), placements and graduate positions around Europe
*  [prospects.ac.uk](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/), a jobs board accompanied by job searching advice
* [InsideCareers.co.uk](https://www.insidecareers.co.uk) is good if you're looking for jobs in the  financial sector
* [varsitycareershub.co.uk](https://www.varsitycareershub.co.uk/), targeting students from [Loxbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxbridge) but many of the employers recruit much more widely
*  [Year in Industry](https://www.etrust.org.uk/yini-vacancies) if you're looking for a year in industry
* Your University careers service. University jobs boards are good places to look for opportunities that are specifically targeted at students of the University where you are studying. So if you're studying at the University of Manchester it's [careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk](https://careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk/user/jobs.html) (UoM login required)

### More general resources {#generaljobs}
The following job finding tools are aimed at a wider audience (not just students and graduates) but will be useful to you nonetheless.

```{r googlejobs-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongooglejobsearch)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/google-job-search.jpeg")
```
(ref:captiongooglejobsearch) Keywords like `job` and `intern` in an ordinary google search will trigger Google's job search product, an enhanced search feature that aggregates listings from many different jobs boards. See the text below for examples. CC BY-SA picture of the [Googleplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex) in California by The Pancake of Heaven via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3X4t](https://w.wiki/3X4t) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Google job search shown in figure \@ref(fig:googlejobs-fig) is a good starting point. It doesn't index *every* job listings site, see [Google's job hunting service comes to UK](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44853472) [@noindeed], but its a pretty good place to start.

* Google job search indexes jobs advertised by many of the resources mentioned in this chapter. You can use google job search use to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven't used it already try the searches below. Unlike other sites, Google job search works by indexing embedded [microdata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)) structured using [schema.org/JobPosting](https://schema.org/JobPosting). Keywords like `job` and `intern` in an ordinary (vanilla) google search will trigger the job search product, as shown in the following examples:

    -[google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester](https://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester)

    -[google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern](https://www.google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern)

    -[google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer](https://www.google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer)

    -[google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london](https://www.google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london)

    -[google.com/search?q=data+scientist+intern](https://www.google.com/search?q=data+scientist+intern)

    -[google.com/search?q=research+software+engineer+job](https://www.google.com/search?q=research+software+engineer+job)

    -Google job search is an impressive product, see [grow.google/job-seekers](https://grow.google/job-seekers) but it doesn't index *everything*. If you're looking for a job AT google, they have moved from [jobs.google.com](https://jobs.google.com/about/) to [careers.google.com](https://careers.google.com/), see also section \@ref(bignames)

* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) advertises job vacancies, is [frequently visited by recruiters](https://blog.linkedin.com/2016/10/06/now-you-can-privately-signal-to-recruiters-youre-open-to-new-job) and you can often [apply for jobs directly on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/75815/applying-for-jobs-on-linkedin?lang=en) (although [making fast applications is not always a good thing](https://medium.com/otta-blog/job-boards-making-fast-applications-is-not-a-good-thing-5a4970887ecd)). See [linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students) and figure \@ref(fig:linkedin-fig). It allows you to do more than just search for jobs, see table \@ref(tab:linkedintable).

```{r linkedin-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionlinkedin)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/linkedin.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionlinkedin) [Linkedin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn) is a social media service which allows employers to advertise job vacancies online and candidates like you to apply for them. Social media caveats aside (see section \@ref(signposts3)), LinkedIn can be useful tool for networking with other professionals and finding a job, see table \@ref(tab:linkedintable).

### Recruiters {#recruiters}

Recruiters can help you find work and they operate in every industry sector. They are sometimes called ‚Äúhead-hunters‚Äù, and there are two basic kinds that can help you:

1. Recruiters employed directly by an employer, for example in the human resources (HR) department of a given organisation.
1. Recruiters who are self-employed or work for a recruitment agency. They typically earn money from the number of interview candidates and successful hires they provide for their clients.

Recruiters are usually not technical people, so don't expect them to have lots of knowledge about software engineering (for example) - that isn't usually their skill set. Although recruiters can help you, it is worth being wary of recruiters as shown in figure \@ref(fig:recruiter-fig), especially if they work for an agency rather than being directly employed by the organisation you are interested in.

```{r recruiter-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionrecruiter)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/recruiters-are.png")
```
(ref:captionrecruiter) The autocomplete algorithm of a well known search engine gives you an idea of what *some* people think about *some* recruiters. This doesn't mean you should avoid recruiters completely, just be careful how you use them and pay attention to who they work for.

Some recruiters are very good and can help you. For example, there are some recruitment agencies that specialise in helping employers recruit graduates, these may be useful to you. However some recruiters are not very good, and don't provide a valued service for employers or potential employees like you. This is why you sometimes see `no recruiters` or `no agencies` on job adverts. So be wary of recruiters, and remember that some recruiters work primarily for their clients (employers) not you.

In most cases you shouldn't have to pay recruiters up front but job scammers will sometimes pose as recruiters so beware. Talking of job scammers, there's some things you need to be wary of when you are job hunting:

## Buyer beware {#beware}
When you're looking for job you're acting as both a buyer *and* a seller.

1. **SELLING**: You're selling your services in a marketplace, for the best price you can get
1. **BUYING**: You're buying into the culture and values of an employer (see section \@ref(soul)), who are trying to sell themselves to you.

As a buyer and seller, you should be wary of the following:

* ü§•  Job scammers: section \@ref(scams)
* ü§£  Over-specified jobs: section \@ref(overspec)
* üò≠  Unpaid internships: section \@ref(unpaid)
* üìà  Overselling: section \@ref(oversell)
* üìâ  Underselling: section \@ref(undersell)
* ü§î  Compromises: section \@ref(compromises)
* ‚è∞  Time sink: section \@ref(timesink)
* ü§Æ  Rejection: section \@ref(rejection)
* üé¢  The rollercoaster: section \@ref(rollercoaster)

### Beware of the job scammers {#scams}
Most job adverts are legitimate but you are vulnerable when you are job hunting. You may become more vulnerable over time if you are getting repeated rejections (remember: repeated rejection is quite normal). Unfortunately there are some shady characters out there looking to exploit your vulnerability through various kinds of [employment fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_fraud). [@jobscammers] You should be wary of anyone asking you for:

* Money up front - be very suspicious
* Excessive personal data such your birth date, passport number and bank details. These could be used for identity theft, fraud or other criminal activities
* Suspicious contact details and generic non-work free email addresses, e.g. gmail, outlook.com etc [@jobscammers2]
* See more examples in figure \@ref(fig:jobscams-fig) and at [google.com/search?q=job+scams](https://www.google.com/search?q=job+scams)

```{r jobscams-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionjobscams)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Job-Scams-Signs-GOVUK.png")
```
(ref:captionjobscams) Beware of the job scammers. You should be highly suspicious of illegitimate companies, poorly-written job adverts, dodgy contact details and emails, unrealistic salaries, job offers without an interview and being asked for money up front. Spotting the signs of job scammers by gov.uk is licensed under [Open Government Licence v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) [@jobscammers2]

Reputable employers (and jobs boards) will not try to scam you, but you should beware of job scammers if you find yourself looking for employment off the beaten track. Like [Pinocchio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocchio), its quite easy to spot lies once you recognise some of their nosey signals. ü§•

### Beware of over-specified jobs {#overspec}
Employers and recruiters routinely over-specify job descriptions. A good example of this is, when the [Swift programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) was first publicly released in 2014 at the [Apple Worldwide Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference) (WWDC) in California, job adverts instantly appeared asking for programmers with `5 years experience in Swift`! How can *anyone* have five years experience in a programming language that's only just been made public?! Aside from the people who developed the language, like [Chris Lattner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner), the recruiters and employers must have had a *long* search trying to find their candidate. It must have taken them at least five years!

```{r eval=knitr::is_html_output(excludes = "epub"), iamdevloper-fig,echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Job interview: sort binary tree. Job: manually update csv files ... We're looking for someone aged 22-26 with 30 years of experience "}
library(tweetrmd)
include_tweet("https://twitter.com/Mubeeen_/status/1288115932154363905")
```

The moral of this Apple story above is, if you don't meet *all* the criteria in a job specification, that shouldn't stop you applying. Most job specifications are over-specified as wishful employers dream up their ideal candidate.^[Using a relationship analogy, describe your ideal romantic partner. PAUSE. How many people are actually likely to have ALL of those attributes?] Many employers will overstate their requirements in the hope they get their dream candidate. You might look at the job description and think, *I've only got 70% of what they're asking for, so I won't bother applying*. The reality is, if you've got 60% of what they are asking for, you should probably apply. It's unlikely that *anyone* will meet 100% of the job requirements.

If you see things on job adverts you don't understand or are not sure about, go and find out about them. There's a good chance it will be similar to something you already know about, or you can self-educate yourself to fill any gaps. But beware of employers over-specifying jobs. ü§£

### Beware of unpaid internships {#unpaid}
In the United Kingdom, it is illegal to employ people without paying them a salary. However, there are exceptions which can allow employers to take on unpaid interns depending on how they classify their employment status. See for example:

* Employment rights and pay for interns [gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns](https://www.gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns)
* Targetjobs position on [the law on unpaid internships: know your rights ](https://targetjobs.co.uk/internships/advice/275017-the-law-on-unpaid-internships-know-your-rights)
* This article on [Why I Regret Doing an Unpaid Internship](https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/blog/why-i-regret-doing-an-unpaid-internship/) [@louiseregret]
* For more horror stories see [google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships](https://www.google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships)

In science, technology and engineering, unpaid internships are much less common than in other sectors as demand for skilled scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians ([STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)) is generally high. Some employers, particularly startups, may offer company [equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)) (such as shares) as an alternative to a salary - again you should be wary of this. Unless you're very lucky, the chances are those shares will probably be worthless. Although many startups aspire to become [Unicorns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)), very few do. Like many people, I don't endorse unpaid internships, and I recommend you avoid them completely. An unpaid internship might claim to be giving you:

* some ‚Äúexperience‚Äù
* some ‚Äúexposure‚Äù
* something impressive for your CV
* opportunities to ‚Äúbuild up your portfolio‚Äù
* improved access to paid employment in the future

Unfortunately, in the worst case, taking an unpaid internship leaves you vulnerable to exploitation by ruthless employers looking for cheap or free labour. üò≠

If you can't find paid employment, doing voluntary work is a much safer bet and has mental health and social benefits too, see section \@ref(areuexperienced).

### Beware of overselling {#oversell}
When people try to sell you something, you will naturally be wary of overselling and fake news, see figure \@ref(fig:fakenews-fig).

```{r fakenews-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfakenews)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/overselling.png")
```
(ref:captionfakenews) Beware of false or misleading information in the jobs marketplace. Pool tables and free snacks are nice but are what is it *actually* like to work for a given employer? Are employers *really* as good as they say they are? Are *you* as good as you say you are? Or is it [fake news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news)? Overselling sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

There's two kinds of fake news that are common in the jobs marketplace:

1. Employers overselling themselves. Recruitment can be a bit of a beauty contest, with employers trying to show you their best side. Some employers may make promises they can't deliver but a quick look on sites like [glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com) will help you evaluate employers. Even better, talk directly with actual employees of the organisation, both current and former. Is their employer really as good as they say they are?
1. You exaggerate your achievements: It can be tempting to oversell yourself in the marketplace. An experienced reader or interviewer will be able to spot your fake news and find you out, see chapter \@ref(debugging) *debugging your future*

So beware of fake news and overselling. [Don't believe the hype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Believe_the_Hype). [@dontbelievethehype] üìà

### Beware of underselling {#undersell}
Likewise, you should make sure you don't undersell yourself. Know your value (financial), know your values (see chapter are \@ref(knowing)) and try to understand how that fits with a given employer. What are the employers stated values? On the financial side, it is easy to find out about salaries, for example see:

* [glassdoor.co.uk](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/) and [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) will give you a good idea for your current and future salary expectations
* [technical intern salaries in the UK](https://github.com/IgWod/interns-salaries-uk-2018) [@igwod]
* [graduate salaries in the UK](https://luminate.prospects.ac.uk/graduate-salaries-in-the-uk) [@michaelgrove]
* [The Highest Paid Internships and Placements in the UK](https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/blog/highest-paid-internships-placements-uk/) [@louiseintern]

Salaries in the UK for interns (and graduates) range from [minimum wage](https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage) to ¬£50k and over, with everything in between. So beware of under-selling yourself, know your value. Some employers see students as a form of cheap labour that can be exploited because you're not ‚Äúqualified‚Äù until you graduate. I'd think twice before working for such an employer, computing skills are in demand and there are plenty of other employers who will treat you with more respect. üìâ

Knowing your value is crucial if you're going to negotiate any job offers you receive, see section \@ref(offer).

### Beware of compromises {#compromises}
Engineering inevitably involves compromises and trade-offs, see figure \@ref(fig:furber-fig). You will have to make some compromises in engineering your future. This might be in the design and implementation of your career, such as your salary, location, employer, values or something else.

```{r furber-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfurber)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/steve-furber.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionfurber) The design of a general-purpose processor, in common with most engineering endeavours, requires careful consideration of many trade-offs and compromises. [@furberarm] That's also true for your engineering your future too, what compromises and trade-offs are you happy to make? CC BY-SA portrait of microprocessor designer [Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber) by Peter Howkins on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/544E](https://w.wiki/544E) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

To work out what compromises and trade-offs you are prepared to make, you may need to revisit the issues discussed in chapter \@ref(knowing). ü§î

### Beware of the time sink {#timesink}
Finding employers that you are interested in and submitting high quality job applications takes lots of time. Many students under estimate the time needed to job hunt. It can be a very time consuming process for everyone, both employers and candidates alike, see figure \@ref(fig:timesink-fig).

```{r timesink-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiontimesink)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/timesink.jpeg")
```
(ref:captiontimesink) Playing the game of job hunting can be a big drain on your time and some time wasting is unfortunately inevitable. Employers will waste some of your valuable time and you'll probably waste some of theirs too. Beware of the recruitment [time sink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_sink). Public domain image of a DualShock PlayStation controller by [Evan Amos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Amos) on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3VFp](https://w.wiki/3VFp) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Even after you have managed to:

1. Identify and articulate your skills and knowledge, see chapter \@ref(knowing)
1. Understand what you're interested in, see chapter \@ref(knowing)
1. Update your CV, see chapter \@ref(debugging)
1. Consider all your options, see chapter \@ref(broadening)
1. Target employers or sectors of interest

.. the actual business of applying described in this chapter can be very bureaucratic. Any interviews you have will take time to prepare for (see chapter \@ref(speaking)) and you've got loads of other calls on your time like studying and having a social life.

One way to tackle this problem is to schedule some time every week when you work on applications, see chapter \@ref(scheduling). However, there's no getting away from the fact that finding a job can consume a significant amount of your time. So beware of the time sink. ‚è∞

### Beware of rejection {#rejection}
For most people, rejection is a normal part of applying for jobs. Rejection can take a heavy toll on your mental health described in chapter \@ref(nurturing) and it is often a struggle. Some employers won't even bother to reply to reject you. Welcome to the employer **black hole** described in section \@ref(blackhole) and shown in figure \@ref(fig:blackhole-fig).

```{r blackhole-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionblackhole)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Black-hole-CV.png")
```

(ref:captionblackhole) Rejection is a normal part of applying for jobs, some of your applications may disappear without trace into employers ‚Äú[black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole)‚Äù we discussed in section \@ref(blackhole). This is likely to happen with larger employers who may have a strong gravitational force on job applicants like you. This *doesn't* mean you shouldn't bother applying, but that you need to think about how to make your application stand out and avoid taking it personally if/when  you don't hear back. CV black hole sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/), based on an original image of the supermassive black hole in [Messier 87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87) created using the [CHIRP algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIRP_(algorithm)) by the [Event Horizon Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Horizon_Telescope) team via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3RCa](https://w.wiki/3RCa)

If you're getting too many rejections or all your applications are sucked into black holes, it might be because you need to :

* debug your CV and job applications some more (see chapter \@ref(debugging))
* develop a better job search strategy (see this chapter, chapter \@ref(finding))
* broaden your job search (see chapter \@ref(broadening))
* pay attention to your mental health, rejections can make you anxious and depressed (see chapter \@ref(nurturing))

So beware of rejection, it's a normal part of job hunting. ü§Æ

### Beware of the rollercoaster {#rollercoaster}
There are highs and lows in job hunting, you will ride the job search rollercoaster shown in figure \@ref(fig:rollercoaster-fig). There will be highs, you'll be invited to interviews, but there will be also be lows too, such as the inevitable rejections we discussed in the previous section \@ref(rejection). It will be a rollercoaster, which ends on the high of a job offer you accept. Fasten your seatbelt, enjoy the ride and good luck with your applications and interviews! May the road rise with you! [@rise]

```{r rollercoaster-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionrollercoaster)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Rollercoaster-ride.png")
```

So beware of the rollercoaster, it has ups and down. Before we move on to talk about broadening your options, lets looks at some basic job search strategies you can use to get started. üé¢

## Job search strategies {#strategies}
Now that you are aware of some pitfalls you need to think about developing a range of different strategies for job hunting, and change the strategy during the year. At the beginning of the academic year in September you might target large multinational organisations. If you're not successful, you could switch to smaller employers later in the academic year. Table \@ref(tab:shortcuts) summarises some of the when and where some employers typically advertise.

```{r shortcuts, echo = FALSE}
job_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ ""       , ~ "Large employers", ~ "SMEs",
  "Where"    , "Advertise broadly", "Less likely to advertise on big jobs boards",
  "When"     , "Vacancies open earlier in the academic year", "Vacancies tend to open later in the academic year",
  "How"      , "Typically multistage applications, several rounds of interviews", "Typically shorter application and interview processes",
  "Who"      , "Typically receive high volume of applications per vacancy", "Typically receive lower volume of applications per vacancy",
  "Process"  , "Unlikely to consider speculative applications", "May consider speculative or informal applications",
)
knitr::kable(job_table, caption = "The practicalities of applying for vacancies, internships, placements, graduate jobs and schemes in large multinational employers and small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs)", booktabs = TRUE)
```

Armed with knowledge of *when* to apply you can start to target employers. What will your strategy be? Should you optimise the *quantity* of your applications or the  *quality*, see figure \@ref(fig:blunderbuss-fig)?

```{r blunderbuss-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionblunderbuss)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Blunderbuss.png")
```
(ref:captionblunderbuss) As you target employers, what will your strategy be? At one extreme you could optimise the *quantity* of your applications, aiming to do as many as you can. This is shown in the left of the picture by the [blunderbuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunderbuss) (or scattergun) strategy. You make lots of applications but don't target or tailor them much in the hope that *some* will hit the target if you point your weapon (CV) in approximately the right general direction. At the other extreme you could optimise the *quality* of your applications by spending more time researching the employer and carefully aiming your shots more like a sniper would (in the right of the figure). Which strategy is best? Blunderbuss sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Figure \@ref(fig:blunderbuss-fig) shows two extreme approaches to job hunting, in reality you'll probably want to strike a balance between *quality* and *quantity*. If you find yourself:

* Making a small number of applications, you may need to consider applying more widely and spending *less time* on each application
* Making a large number of applications, you may need to consider applying less and spending  *more time* on each application

This raises the question, how big is a *small* or a *large* number of job applications?

## The power of weak ties {#weakties}

Your close network probably won't change that much, the friends and family you trust and rely on. Its important to recognise the importance of more casual acquaintances, or what sociologist [Mark Granovetter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter) calls  ‚Äúweak ties‚Äù. [@granovetter]

```{r bumped-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbumped)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Bumped into.png")
```
(ref:captionbumped) [It's not what you know, its who you know](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it%27s_not_what_you_know_but_who_you_know). Networking and personal contacts can be more useful than just knowledge and skills alone, when seeking employment. Networking is an essential part of any job search, your networks can help you now and in the future. One of the things looked at in this chapter is how to build and use your networks to help find the job you're after. The simplest networking technique is bumping into people, but you need create opportunities for that to happen. Bumped into sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

 Weak ties are people you don't know as well, but are important for a range of reasons. Research has shown that [building networks of weak ties is good for your mental health and can give you an edge in job hunting](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-why-your-weak-tie-friendships-may-mean-more-than-you-think). [@weakties] Granovetter showed that many job opportunities came through weak ties, rather than strong ones. This is true not just of jobs early on in your career (like now) but also later too. So it is in your interests to continually foster weak connections and be open to serendipitous meetings where you bump into people, as in Figure \@ref(fig:bumped-fig). ‚ÄúBumping into‚Äù here, could mean either physical or virtual.

```{r net-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionnetworks)"}

```

(ref:captionnetworks) Who is in your network? Grow and use your network, both the strong ties and the weak ties. Weak ties are often the most important when it comes to job hunting.

## Summarising search {#tldr8}

[Too long, didn't read](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read) (TL;DR)? Here's a summary:

We've looked at search techniques that will help you find opportunities you care about. Figuring out what you want to do is tricky at times but it usually works out well in the end.


This chapter is under construction because I'm using agile book development methods, see figure \@ref(fig:deathstar5-fig).

<!--
It is no secret that, when applying for placements and graduate jobs, you are likely to submit multiple applications before being offered a role. In response to rejections, students are often encouraged to ‚Äòbe resilient‚Äô and ‚Äòkeep trying‚Äô ‚Äì but there‚Äôs a lot more to it than that.

While it‚Äôs important to bounce back from rejection and keep applying to opportunities, churning out one application after another in the name of resilience isn‚Äôt always productive. It is more important that you are taking steps to minimise rejection and increase your chances of success. And there are several ways that you can do this.

Don‚Äôt take a scattergun approach

You are more likely to be successful sending out five targeted, tailored applications than twenty untailored applications for roles you do not meet all the requirements for. So, my first piece of advice is to create targeted applications for opportunities you have a reasonable chance of getting (i.e. you meet all the necessary criteria).

You‚Äôll need to tailor each application to the employer and the role, detailing why you are interested in the opportunity and giving examples of what makes you the best person for the job. This will ensure that the applications you do send out are of a high quality.

Learn from feedback

If you‚Äôre unsuccessful at interview, make use of any feedback to identify areas for improvement. It‚Äôs important that you are self-critical and that you don‚Äôt take rejection personally. Acknowledge what you did well and improve on what you could have done better, so that your next application has a greater chance of success.

Create a schedule

Set yourself a reasonable target for the number of applications you are going to submit each week. It‚Äôs important that this target is realistic for you, so be sure to factor in your other responsibilities and priorities.

Designating a specific time to work on your applications should help you stay focused and motivated. It‚Äôs also likely to safeguard against burnout; in other words, it‚Äôll stop you from overworking yourself, which doesn‚Äôt usually do much for the quality of your work.

Moreover, working to a schedule means you‚Äôll have ongoing applications at different stages. If you receive a rejection from one application, you‚Äôre likely to have others in progress, which should help you stay motivated and remain optimistic.

Keep an open mind

Try to think laterally when choosing which opportunities to apply for. It can be tempting to apply to companies which you are already familiar with, and while there are lots of advantages of working for large, well-known organisations, there are just as many benefits to working for medium-sized companies and SMEs that you perhaps might not have heard of.

By considering the full range of companies on Gradcracker, you open yourself up to more opportunities, and more chances of success.

Equally, don‚Äôt just go for the opportunities that are directly related to your degree discipline. As a STEM student, your transferable skills make you highly sought after in a diverse range of sectors and roles, so try to keep an open mind when searching for opportunities.

Now, it‚Äôs time to try again!
I hope these steps help you to bounce back from rejection ‚Äì but also to prevent rejection and increase your chances of success.-->

# Broadening your future {#broadening}

Do you feel like the *weird edge case* pictured in figure \@ref(fig:default-user-fig)? Do typical graduate destinations such as large multi-national corporations, not really make you want to *[Shake Your Thang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_Your_Thang)*? [@saltnpepa] Perhaps you are interested in:

* using your technical skills responsibly and ethically to make the world a better place?
* starting your own business and making money for yourself, rather than other people?
* finding *hidden* or unadvertised vacancies?
* joining a startup instead of a large multinational corporation?
* venturing outside of the private sector?
* working in computing in roles beyond software engineering?

Broadening your initial job search described in chapter \@ref(finding) will open up more opportunities on your horizon. This chapter will broaden those horizons and get you to think about some of the less obvious options, because I *love* weird edge cases and you should too. üòª

```{r default-user-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiondefaultuser)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/default-user-1280x959.png")
```

(ref:captiondefaultuser) Are you a weird edge case? By default, many graduates choose a graduate scheme with big brand, often a [blue-chip multinational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_chip_(stock_market)) employer. While working for these kind of employers has many benefits, they are not the whole story. This chapter looks at some of the alternatives. [Default user](https://bryanmmathers.com/default-user/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Many technology jobs exist outside of technology companies, [@outsideit] because a lot of software is written to be used rather than sold. Consequently, many employers create bespoke software to fit the needs of their business. The people who build it are often employees, rather than people employed by a technology company. In the United States for example, ninety percent of IT jobs are outside the traditional tech industry. Technical jobs outside the technology sector often have the advantage of being more accessible than those within a very competitive technology sector. [@burninglass]

## What you will learn {#ilo11}
1. Describe the less obvious careers that computer science can lead to, besides software engineering, including:
    + Starting a business or joining a startup
    + Working outside of the technology sector
    + Working outside of the private sector (governments, non-profits etc)
    + Roles allied to software engineering that require you to be a conversational programmer
1. Recognise the social responsibility accompanying the power held by computer scientists
1. Evaluate and compare the values of an employer with your own values and ethics

## Beyond software engineering {#otheroles}
The phrase software engineering has been around since [Margaret Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)) (figure \@ref(fig:hamilton-fig)) led the development of software for the [Apollo Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer) in the sixties. However, the *practice* of software engineering has been around even longer right back to [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) in the nineteenth century.
<!--Ada Lovelace is often credited as being the worlds first software engineer-->


```{r hamilton-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionhamilton)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/margaret-hamilton.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionhamilton) The role of software engineer has been around for a long time but there are plenty of other roles for computer scientists beyond software engineering. [Margaret Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)) in 1969 standing next to all of the printed code for the navigation software that she and her MIT team produced for the [Apollo Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer).

Software engineers (or software developers if you prefer) are one of the most popular roles for graduates (see e.g. figure \@ref(fig:nurses-fig)) but there are plenty of affiliated roles that computer scientists go into besides software engineering.

What do these roles entail?

## Research software engineering {#rse}

There are plenty of roles in computing working in research, either in computer science, or working alongside natural scientists, such as Physicists at [home.cern](https://home.cern/) or conventional scientists working at the laboratory bench. For example, there are [lots roles in research software engineering](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-01516-2) (RSE), using software engineering to facilitate better scientific research, see [society-rse.org](https://society-rse.org/).[@rses] For example, CERN employs ten times more engineers and technicians than research physicists, see figure \@ref(fig:cern-fig). For physicists to understand the data that pours off the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) (LHC), you need armies of engineers to enable the scientists to do their work. A *lot* of those engineers are working on hardware and software, and many of them won't be physicists. [@hullcern]

```{r cern-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captioncern)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cern-engineering.jpeg")
```

(ref:captioncern) Many scientific laboratories like CERN employ lots of software and hardware engineers. Computation isn't just a fundamental part of physics, it is key to all the natural sciences so wherever you find scientists, you will also find research software engineers.

An non-exhaustive list of laboratories from the UK and Europe that employ computer scientists is shown below:

* CERN, see [careers.cern](https://careers.cern/) and [careers.cern/join-us/students](https://careers.cern/join-us/students)
* The [Francis Crick Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick_Institute) see e.g. [crick.ac.uk/careers-study/students/sandwich-students](https://www.crick.ac.uk/careers-study/students/sandwich-students)

These are mainly UK opportunities, but it is a similar story around the world. Many Universities and research institutes have summer internships for computer science students working alongside researchers. For example, at the University of Manchester, summer vacancies tend to be advertised each year around April/May. Wherever you are, speak to the head of a research lab you're interested in. Ask them if they have plans to take on summer students.

```{r eval=knitr::is_html_output(excludes = "epub"), rse-fig,echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "test caption"}
library(tweetrmd)
include_tweet("https://twitter.com/ResearchSoftEng/status/1531944240170909696")
```

If you're thinking of doing postgraduate study, see chapter \@ref(researching). Commercial experience gained on a summer internship or placement year is valued by *all* employers (not just commercial ones) so doing an internship or placement during your undergraduate degree is valuable wherever you end up, see section \@ref(realworld).

## With great code comes great responsibility {#peterparker}

Computer scientists wield tremendous power in the twenty first century.  We know that:

* With great power comes great responsibility [@spiderman]
* With great code comes great responsibility [@responsiblecs]

```{r spiderman-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionspiderman)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/With great code.png")
```

(ref:captionspiderman) The greater your code, the greater your superpower. [The greater your superpower, the greater your responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility). What powers does computing give you and how can you use that power responsibly? [@Shapiro2021] With great code sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Given the growing power of computing in the twenty-first century, computer scientists have a duty to society to use that power responsibly and justly. How can they do so? Do computer scientists need to sell their soul to the highest bidder? How can computer science be used to make the world a better place, not just making rich people richer? Lets look at these in turn

## Do you need to sell your soul? {#soul}
You will sometimes hear people saying you need to sell your soul to get a job, shown in figure \@ref(fig:diabolical-fig). See for example:

* [Soul sold for less than ¬£12](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2051061.stm) [@bbcsoul]
* [Am I Selling My Soul to Work for My Company?](https://www.thevectorimpact.com/selling-your-soul/) [@sellmysoul]
* [google.com/search?q=selling+your+soul+to+your+employer](https://www.google.com/search?q=selling+your+soul+to+your+employer)

knitr::include_graphics("images/deal-with-the-devil.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiondevildeal) In European folklore, doing a [deal with the devil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_with_the_Devil) is a motif that recurs in culture. Wealth, power and knowledge are some of the items that might be traded for a persons soul as part of diabolical deal. Will you need to sell your soul to the devil to get the job you want?

So when you're searching for jobs and researching potential employers, one of the first things you need to find out is what the values and ethical principles of an employer are, see section \@ref(beware). This is a quick way to evaluate what makes an organisation who they are. Most employers publish their values and ethics openly, here's a small selection to give you a flavour:

* Amazon [amazon.jobs/en/principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)
* Microsoft [microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-values](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-values)
* Apple [apple.com/compliance](https://www.apple.com/compliance/)
* Google [ai.google/principles](https://ai.google/principles/)
* Morgan Stanley [morganstanley.com/about-us/morgan-stanley-core-values](https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us/morgan-stanley-core-values)

```{r morgan-stanley-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmorganstanley)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/morgan-stanley-times-square.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionmorganstanley) [Morgan Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered in New York City. The firms clients include corporations, governments, institutions and individuals. CC-BY picture of Morgan Stanley HQ in Times Square by [Ajay Suresh](https://flickr.com/photos/ajay_suresh/) on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3Vnt](https://w.wiki/3Vnt) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Let's look at Morgan Stanley (figure \@ref(fig:morgan-stanley-fig)) as an example, I've chosen these values because they are brief and self-explanatory. Morgan Stanley's values are to:

1. Do the right thing: act with integrity
1. Put clients first: listen to what the client is saying and needs
1. Lead with exceptional ideas: win by breaking new ground
1. Commit to Diversity and Inclusion: value individual and cultural differences
1. Give back: serve communities generously with expertise, time and money

Look at these values carefully, or choose the values of another employer you're interested in. What do they mean to you?

Do an employers words match their actions? The words **[Don't be evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil)** are easy to *say* but harder to *action*. Good intentions are often easier said than done.

## Computing the future {#betterplace}
The human race faces some huge challenges in the 21st century:

* Mitigating the effects of [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change), see figure \@ref(fig:greta-fig)
* Tackling inequalities of wealth, income, race and gender [@stanley]
* Ensuring algorithms benefit *everyone* in society, not just the (predominantly) old rich white men that control them, see figure \@ref(fig:justice-fig)
* Providing sufficient food, water, shelter, energy, education and healthcare for a growing global population which is rapidly approaching [8 billion people](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/)
* Meeting all these goals [sustainably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability) and renewably without irreversibly depleting resources

```{r greta-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionclimate)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/greta-thunberg.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionclimate) The overwhelming scientific consensus is that our climate is changing much more rapidly than we'd like. According to the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) (IPCC) we are less than ~~twelve~~ (now nine) years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. As [Greta Thunberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg) put it, our house is on fire. [@gretathunberg] How can computing address this, and other global grand challenges that the human race faces in the 21st century?

How can computing be an ethical force for change that improves the lives people everywhere, not just those that are lucky enough to be on the wealthier side of the digital divide?

* How can computing make a difference?
* How can **YOU** use Computer Science to make the world a better place?

Here are some examples to get you started:

* [Greener computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_computing) and net zero computing, see [greensoftware.foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/) [@Knowles2022; @netzero]
* [Smarter cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city) which use resources more efficiently  [@smartercities]
* Fairer algorithms: see [algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias),  [responsible.ai](https://www.responsible.ai/) and figure \@ref(fig:justice-fig)
* Games for change, games that have social impact see [gamesforchange.org](https://www.gamesforchange.org/)
* Better education enabled by computing, both as a [subject in its own right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science_education), and as an enabler of the teaching and learning of everything else
* Scientific computing for the benefit of humanity, see section \@ref(rse). Creating better, cheaper and faster software and hardware for scientists and engineers, for example:
    - Improved climate modelling and weather forecasting
    - Better healthcare, with [electronic health records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record), (EHR) [personal genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_genomics) and better diagnostic tools
    - Quicker development of new vaccines and drugs, technologies like [Alphafold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold) are already making a difference to [drug discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery) [@Jumper2021]

## Breakpoints {#bp9}
(ref:breakpoint)

```md
* PAUSE ‚è∏Ô∏è
```

* How closely do a given employers values align with your own? You may need to revisit section \@ref(no42).
    + You might not get a 100% match but you're unlikely to enjoy working for an employer where your values don't match very well at all
* Are the stated values of an employer the whole story?
    + Are there any unwritten or unspoken rules?
* Is there anything missing?
* Do the employers actions match their words? What an employer *says* and *does* may be contradictory. Actions speak louder than words
* What can computing do to tackle global challenges described in section \@ref(betterplace)

```md
* RESUME ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
```

Once you've thought about these questions, you stand a much better chance of working out if a given employer is a good match for you. So do you have to sell your soul as shown in figure \@ref(fig:soul-fig)? It depends on what you value and if an employer shares those values with you.

(ref:captionsoul) Here's a dilemma: Do you need to sell your soul to your employer? If so, how much can you get for it? What percentage stake of your soul will they ask for and how much are you willing to give? How do your values align with those of your employer?

# Speaking your future {#speaking}

Congratulations, you've been invited to an interview. It might be by telephone, video link, in person or as part of an assessment centre where you'll be asked to complete several other tasks and tests. Being invited to an interview means that your written application (CV, covering letter, application form or digital portfolio) has hit the target and is bug free, see figure \@ref(fig:bugfree-fig). All that reading and writing has paid off. BULLSEYE! üéØ

```{r bugfree-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbugfree)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/My CV is bug free.png")
```
(ref:captionbugfree) If you have got an interview, then you have proved that your CV is bug free. That doesn't mean your CV is perfect, it just means that it is good enough to get you an interview with that particular employer. Congratulations! What comes next? Bug free sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Having passed the first stage of *reading and writing*, you move onto *listening and speaking* stage of interviewing. One of your goals is to convince the interviewers that you can articulate yourself clearly, and communicate well by listening carefully to their questions and answering with spoken natural language. These are fundamental communication skills discussed in section \@ref(cio) on communication I/O.

If you've got an interview, you can feel good about having a bug-free CV shown in figure \@ref(fig:bugfree-fig). Now you have a new set of problems to tackle. How can you prepare for the interview? What kinds of interviews exist and what questions might you be asked? If they offer you a job, how will you negotiate the terms, conditions and salary? Do you *really* want the job and are they the kind of people you actually want to work with everyday? If successful, you will be giving this employer:

* most of the hours of your day
* most of the days of your week
* most of the weeks of your year

This job will take a significant chunk of the next few months, year or even up to two years (and more) for a graduate scheme [@jonathanblack]. It's  the start of a much longer journey of up to [80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/) that you'll spend in employment during your life.

So you want to ensure employers are a good match and not going to waste your time. You'll be interviewing them, as well as them interviewing you, so it will pay to have some questions prepared alongside your answers to questions you can anticipate.

## What you will learn {#ilo9}

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

1. Identify kinds of interviews you might be invited to
1. Anticipate common interview questions, both technical and non-technical
1. Prepare questions for your interviewer by researching the employer
1. Formulate strategies for negotiating job offers
1. Calm your interview nerves

## Interviews
<!-- Add BOB YOU"RE ON MUTE!!! -->

Broadly speaking there are two basic kinds of interviews:

1. non-technical interview, sometimes called competency based interview or human resources (HR) style interview, see \@ref(hrinterview)
1. technical style or [coding interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_interview), see section \@ref(codinginterview)

These can be conducted in various modes:

### Modes of interview {#mode}

Interviews can be conducted in various modes:

* telephone (no visual contact)
* pre-recorded pieces to camera, you talking to your webcam
* teleconference (zoom / teams etc) with cameras and microphones turned on
* real-time face to face


### Competency interviews {#hrinterview}

Competency interviews test some of your softer skills, find out who you are (see chapter \@ref(knowing)), how you work in a team and if you can communicate well. A good interview strategy for any interview is to talk about what you are doing (and what you have done) as shown in figure \@ref(fig:overthinking-fig). It might even help to have a checklist in your head of things you'd like to talk about such as:

* one work experience, see chapter \@ref(experiencing)
* a couple of projects, see section \@ref(mycvpj)
* some university projects, see section \@ref(mycvpj).

If you can, make sure you've mentioned everything on your checklist by the end of the interview.

```{r overthinking-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionoverthinking)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Marketing-rule-No1.png")

```

(ref:captionoverthinking) During an interview, you are marketing yourself to an employer while they market themselves to you. It can be easy to overthink your marketing. A simple marketing technique is to just talk about stuff you're doing, projects you've worked on (inside and outside University), your experience and any other relevant activities. [The number 1 rule of marketing](https://bryanmmathers.com/the-1-rule-of-marketing/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Here are some common competency interview questions. Imagine you are going on a stage, prepare lines that answer these questions, rehearse them out loud in front of a mirror (or a critical friend).

1. What roles do you play in a team, with examples?
1. Tell me about a time when you showed integrity and professionalism
1. Can you give an example of a situation where you solved a problem in a creative way?
1. Tell me about a big decision you've made recently. How did you go about it?
1. Give an example of a time you resolved conflict
1. How do you maintain healthy working relationships with your team?
1. Describe a project where you had to use different leadership styles to reach your goal
1. Give me an example of a challenge you faced and tell me how you overcame it
1. How do you influence people in a situation with conflicting agendas?
1. Tell me about a time that you made a decision and then changed your mind.
1. Tell me about a time when you achieved success even when the odds were stacked against you.
1. Tell me about a time when you have provided an excellent service
1. Give me an example of a time when you have had multiple deadlines to meet? How did prioritise your workload?
1. What would you say is your main development area?

For more examples of non-technical questions see:

* [google.com/search?q=competency+based+interview+questions](https://www.google.com/search?q=competency+based+interview+questions)
<!--* [careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/interviews](https://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/interviews/)-->

Since there's already tonnes of information on competency based interviews, the rest of this chapter will focus on technical interviews, also known as [coding interviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_interview).

### Coding interviews {#codinginterview}
Many employers use technical or coding interviews to assess your harder skills. Not every employer does, but they are widely used by employers. Preparing for coding interviews is a good way to become a better engineer, so even if you don't have to face a series of really tough coding interviews, it is worth knowing about them.

::: {.rmdcaution}
(ref:codingcaution)

The competitive coding and technical interviews described in this chapter test a narrow set of algorithmic skills. While it's important to prepare for technical interviews, [they have well documented limitations](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-criticisms-of-Cracking-the-Coding-interview). [@murashenkov] Skills required for software engineering go beyond the purely technical ones. For example, your (soft) communication skills outlined in chapter \@ref(writing), and many other broader skills, are just as important as your (hard) technical abilities.

Solving different coding challenges can help you become a better problem solver, master a given programming language, prepare for job interviews and learn new algorithms. It will help you become a better engineer and can provide good evidence for the experience section of your CV.-->


There are a lots of resources to help you prepare for and practice coding interview questions, the best place to start is *Cracking the Coding Interview* by [Gayle Laakmaan McDowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell). [@cracking] As well as reading Gayle's book, there are lots of online resources to help you prepare for coding interviews. Before we look at those, University of Manchester Computer Science graduate Petia Davidova explains in figure \@ref(fig:petia-fig) what she learned from failing several coding interviews at big technology companies. üò≠


```{r petia-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionpetia)"}

```

(ref:captionpetia) Petia describes her worst software engineering interview failures. [@youtube-petia] Petia demonstrates a growth mindset (section \@ref(growthmindset)) and productive failure(s). Although she failed her interviews, she learned lots from the process and went on to get a job she wanted.

<!--if kipling-->

Coding interviews can be tough, but preparing for them, and doing them will make you a better engineer. So if you spectacularly wipeout in your coding interview, reflect and think how can you improve next time? Perhaps you need to

* Read up on some more data structures
* Familiarise yourself with more algorithms
* Practice thinking out loud (verbally) by doing a mock technical interview?

All of these activities will help both your general professional development and your chances of success in future technical interviews. Thankfully there are plenty of resources out there for helping you get better at coding interviews, so let's have a look at some. Some of these resources are more about problem solving for recreation, rather than interview preparation, but they will all help you become a better engineer.

### Leetcode {#leetcode}
LeetCode is a platform to help you enhance your skills, expand your knowledge and prepare for technical interview see [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com).

### HackerRank {#hackerrank}
HackerRank allows developers to practice their coding skills, prepare for interviews and get hired. HackerRank allows users to submit applications and apply to jobs by solving company-sponsored coding challenges. Some employers use hackerrank as part of the interviewing process, so these are not just academic exercises.

Hacker Rank provide a discussion and leaderboard for every challenge, and most challenges come with an editorial that explains more about the challenge, see [hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and figure \@ref(fig:hackerrank-fig)

```{r hackerrank-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionhackerrank)"}

### ICPC

More than 50,000 students worldwide from more than 3,000 universities in 111 countries participate in over 400 on-site competitions as part of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) see [icpc.global](https://icpc.global/) and figure \@ref(fig:icpc-fig).

```{r icpc-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionicpc)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/International-Collegiate-Programming-Contest.jpeg")

```

(ref:captionicpc) In their own words, ICPC is ‚Äúan algorithmic programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world.‚Äù [@icpc]

ICPC is organised by the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery) (ACM), a global community which advances computing as a science and a profession.

There are subregional contests for ICPC, so in the UK there is the United Kingdom and Ireland Programming Competition (UKIEPC) which is part of the Northwestern Europe European Regional Contest (NWERC).

UKIEPC has been held annually since 2013 to help universities pick teams to travel to NWERC. Ask your University if they are involved, see [ukiepc.info](http://ukiepc.info). If they aren't involved yet, you could encourage them to join. It's not just about winning, it's also about taking part.

## Breakpoints {#bp10}
(ref:breakpoint)

```md
* PAUSE ‚è∏Ô∏è

Let's imagine you're applying to work at an employer called `widget.com`. During your application you need to find out:

* What the main products and services that the organisation provides?
* Who are their clients or customers?
* Who are their biggest competitors?
* What are their values, principles and ethical policies? See section \@ref(bp9)
* What sector do they principally operate in?
* Who are the market leaders in that sector?
* How is the sector changing, for example how is technology having an impact on their business?

```md

```

## Accepting job offers {#offer}
If you've been successful in an interview you will receive a job offer. This is time to celebrate (congratulations!) and in some cases negotiate.

If you're not happy with the package on offer, the best time to negotiate is **before** you accept it. It is often easier to negotiate now, than get a pay rise later. This is one factor that means people leave jobs, it is often easier to get a pay rise by moving employers, rather than being promoted with an existing employer. Knowing your value is important here, its easy to find out with sites like glassdoor we mentioned in section \@ref(generaljobs).
<!--https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/247-->
Besides the pay, you might also want to negotiate about flexible working, start date and any benefits on offer.

<!--This is not a book about negotiation but see never split the difference-->

## Communication, communication, communication! {#comms}
Interviews are about a lot more than the answers you give to questions, they also test *how* you communicate, both verbally and non-verbally. We looked at communication skills in section \@ref(cio) and throughout chapter \@ref(writing) on *writing your future*. This chapter has discussed some spoken communication skills which complement your written communication skills.

```{r carole-goble-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongoble)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/carole-goble.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiongoble) Computing is about much more than technology. Interviews will test some of your spoken communication skills, these are fundamental in working with and for people. [@frengoble] CC BY-SA portrait of scientist and engineer [Carole Goble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Goble) by Rob Whitrow on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/5542](https://w.wiki/5542) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Computing is not just about technology - it is actually more about working with and for people, see figure \@ref(fig:carole-goble-fig). So as well as testing technical knowledge, an interview (coding interview or otherwise) is a test of *how* you communicate in spoken language, not just how you speak, but how you listen and converse while you work with other people. [@frengoble]

# Surviving your future {#surviving}

Congratulations, you've just accepted an offer of employment. You nailed that interview (or interviews) and you're just about to embark on the exciting journey from the world of study to the jungle of employment. This *might* be your first SERIOUS job, so what do you have to do to survive and become a professional? What survival skills will you need, see figure \@ref(fig:survival-fig). Even better, how can you thrive in your new role and take on the challenges that are coming your way? How will you avoid *diving*, ensuring you *survive* and hopefully *thrive* in your new environment? üí™

<!--More on communication needed feedback from norway

Another big difference is that in employment everyone starts from scratch all the time, in my experience. In university starting from scratch / being 'behind' is a common insecurity, which made it difficult for me to ask for help when I needed it. It took a while to learn that at work you succeed and fail as a team, not an individual, and there is nothing wrong with not understanding and asking for help.

In short, I agree with you that a lot of "survive, thrive or die" lies in your relationship with your manager and team. Hence I wish you wrote more about this than a tweet from 'Help! I have a manager!'. It is very good, but I didn't think to spend the $10 for it when I needed it the most. Especially when a lot of the "Stay in school" section could be repeated in "Achieving your future".-->

<!--Different ways for success
The example for thriving purely mentions promotion as a good. I think it could be valuable to underline that good communication and self-reflection could lead to not any promotion, but promotion to a fulfilling role!

I think the chapter outlines some of the broader challenges going from uni to employment.  Where I feel the chapter lacks is in fully diving into the best ways to avoid "diving" and maybe even getting to "thrive". A lot of the chapter is spent on furthering your career and self-development, which presumes "surviving" with capacity for more or "thriving".-->

## What you will learn {#ilo10}

<!--If you want to get ahead get a hat-->
At the end of this chapter you will be able to

1. Manage your manager so that you can:
    + Survive the workplace
    + Thrive in the workplace
    + Avoid diving in a workplace environment
1. Collect evidence of new workplace skills and knowledge that you develop <!--WWW-->
1. Reflect on new workplace skills and knowledge that you need to develop <!--EBI-->

## Survive, thrive or dive? {#scenarios}
Starting a new job is a bit like starting a new relationship, except that it is professional rather than romantic. You've searched for and found a partner. You've been through the courtship of recruitment, this might have been quick or may have had many rounds of first and second ‚Äúdates‚Äù (interviews). Once you start employment, you are both committed to each other in a serious relationship. Simply put, there are three scenarios for you as a new employee. You'll survive, thrive or dive.

### Survive {#survive}
Your new job will go OK, you'll meet the expectations of your employer and become and valued employee. If your employer has a probationary period, you'll pass your probationary review without any problems. Most employees probably fit in to this category. üÜó

### Thrive  {#thrive}
Your new job will go brilliantly, you'll exceed the expectations of your employer. If you're on a fixed term contract, such as a summer internship or year long placement, they'll make you a job offer during or soon after your contract of employment expires. If you're on a more permanent contract, such as a graduate job or graduate scheme you'll be promoted and given more responsibility. üí™

You're doing really well if you can impress your manager. Some lucky people make it into this category.

### Dive {#dive}

Your new job will go badly, you will struggle to fit in and won't meet the expectations of your employer. Once you were like [star-crossed lovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-crossed), (see figure \@ref(fig:romeo-fig)) but the relationship has turned sour and could take a disastrous dive into [tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy). [@romeo; @goblewroe]

```{r romeo-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionromeo)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/star-crossed-lovers.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionromeo) Your relationship with your employer is obviously a professional one rather than a romantic one, but that doesn't mean it can't end in tragedy like Shakespeare's [star-crossed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-crossed) lovers in *Romeo and Juliet*. [@romeo] What can you do to keep your relationship with your employer healthy and happy? Public domain image of a painting of Romeo and Juliet by Frank Dicksee via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3DfJ](https://w.wiki/3DfJ) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

There are several relationship problems that could lead to you breaking up with (or being dumped by) your newly estranged ‚Äúlover‚Äù. üíî

* **Relationship problems**: Your relationship with your manager(s) is not going well. You've tried solving problems informally by talking to your manager but you‚Äôre not satisfied with the response and want to [raise a formal grievance complaint in writing](https://www.gov.uk/raise-grievance-at-work). [@grievance]
* **It's not you, it's me**: You might ultimately decide to you want to [hand in your notice](https://www.gov.uk/handing-in-your-notice) to terminate your contract of employment and leave. [@iquit]
* **It's not me, it's you**: If things get really bad, your employer may [take disciplinary action against you](https://www.gov.uk/disciplinary-procedures-and-action-at-work) [@dive] and in the worst case scenario, you'll be [fired (dismissed)](https://www.gov.uk/dismissal). [@yourefired]

Dismissal is rare, but it **does** happen, even to interns and placement students. In this scenario in the UK, the employer has a duty to do everything they reasonably can to prevent this from happening. It's not in your employers interests to fire you because they've invested a lot of time and money in you by this point. If they have sensible recruitment procedures, those procedures will root out unsuitable candidates long before they make it to the workplace where they can cause real and lasting damage to the organisation once in post.

All employers have procedures for making sure that you can agree on work that suits both of your needs. Better employers will have better procedures to ensure this happens. Employers don't want their employees to "dive" and will try prevent this from happening wherever possible.

## Managing your manager {#manager}
Building a good relationship with your manager(s) will be key to determining which of the *dive, survive or thrive* scenarios above plays out. At University, you didn't have a manager. Yes you had deadlines, but you didn't have a boss. That changes when you're an employee so it's in your interests to understand what your boss expects of you.

Software engineer Julia Evans has authored a series of programming [zines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine), there's one called [HELP! I have manager!](https://wizardzines.com/zines/manager/) [@helpihaveamanager] you might find useful. It will help you understand your managers job better so that you can work together more effectively. It will help you survive and thrive, not dive because it covers:

* understanding your manager's job
* setting clear expectations
* talking about problems early
* reviewing performance and getting promoted
* asking for specific feedback


```{r eval=knitr::is_html_output(excludes = "epub"),tweet-from-julia,echo=FALSE}
library(tweetrmd)
include_tweet("https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1043277965394681856")
```

The zine has the benefit of being aimed at engineers just like you. Thoroughly recommended! You might also enjoy Julia's other more technical zines such as:

* [HTTP: learn your browser's language](https://wizardzines.com/zines/http/) [@browserslanguage]
* [Oh Shit, Git!](https://wizardzines.com/zines/oh-shit-git/) [@ohshitgit]
* [Hell YES! CSS](https://wizardzines.com/zines/css/) [@hellyescss]
* [How DNS works](https://wizardzines.com/zines/dns/) [@howdnsworks]
* [How containers work](https://wizardzines.com/zines/containers/) [@howcontainerswork]

## Stay in school {#neverstoplearning}
As you develop new skills and knowledge at work, it is a good idea to collect evidence of what you've done. Whatever your career path, you'll need to keep your CV updated. One way to think of the evidence is as *badges*, digital or otherwise. Your employer may already have training schemes that recognise and reward your accomplishments.  These badges may be generic or specific to the particular sector you are working in. See chapter \@ref(achieving) on *Achieving your future* for more details.

### Technical badges {#techie}
Some examples of technical badges include:

* Microsoft Certifications [docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/)
* Amazon Web Services Certification [aws.amazon.com/certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/)
* Google Cloud Certification [cloud.google.com/certification](https://cloud.google.com/certification)

Just three examples, there are many others covering both technical and non-technical skills. In many cases, your employer will encourage and possibly pay for you to get these certifications.

### Non-technical badges {#techieplusplus}
You are more than just a techie, so make sure you develop your non-technical skills as well. We introduced softer skills in chapter \@ref(writing), but there's plenty of other skills to think about:

* Building resilience
* Negotiating and managing conflict
* Leadership, influence and change
* Having difficult conversations
* Emotional intelligence
* Public speaking
* Active listening

### Online & lifelong learning {#mooc}
There are many online platforms for building your skills and knowledge, some examples include:

1. [coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org)
1. [edx.org](https://www.edx.org)
1. [egghead.io](https://egghead.io)
1. [etonx.com](https://etonx.com) like the [famous college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eton_College) it comes from, EtonX courses are not cheap but there's some good stuff here that's aimed at young people like you
1. [futurelearn.com](https://www.futurelearn.com)
1. [khanacademy.org](https://www.khanacademy.org)
1. [linkedin.com/learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning)
1. [open.edu/openlearn](https://www.open.edu/openlearn)
1. [pluralsight.com](https://www.pluralsight.com)
1. [skillshare.com](https://www.skillshare.com)
1. [udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com)
1. [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com)

The choice of online learning can be bewildering. Some platforms provide free resources, others do not, but your employer may already pay for some services making them free to you while you are an employee. If that's the case, make good use of the services while you can. There's a [useful comparison of four different online learning platforms here](https://www.businessinsider.com/online-learning-platform-comparison-udemy-skillshare-lynda-coursera). [@udemy]

### Other training courses {#othertrain}
Your employer may provide other courses you can go on. Again, you should make the most of these if and when they are available.

Whatever job you're doing, stay in school. Take advantage of any training on offer or go and find courses that help you develop professionally and personally. Remember that **you** are the person who cares most about your career, see section \@ref(responsibility).

## Breakpoints {#visits}
(ref:breakpoint)

```md
* PAUSE ‚è∏Ô∏è
```

Besides collecting evidence and managing your manager, you need to manage yourself too. A proven way to do this is to periodically reflect on your work. Your employer may have procedures to help you do this, such as performance reviews or one-to-ones with your manager on a regular basis. Whatever the setup, you will benefit from taking time to reflect on:
<!--During your placement you will be visited by an academic member of staff who will meet with you and your manager at the same time. If you want to meet with your academic tutor without your manager being around, please let your tutor know] The visit is a good opportunity to reflect on what progress you have made during the year alongside areas you need to improve. You will probably already have had similar meetings with your manager or managers, for examples as part of your personal development review (or whatever your employer calls performance reviews). There are three basic questions your tutor will ask you:-->



1. What have you been doing?
1. WWW: What Went Well?
1. EBI: Even Better If?



### What have you been doing?
Briefly describe your roles and responsibilities. What projects have you worked on? What were the main technologies that you used? As well as describing this to colleagues, you should aim to communicate this with non-specialists, people outside your field. How would you describe your job to your friends and family and terms they would understand?

### WWW: What went well?
Are there any projects you are particularly proud of? What new knowledge or skills have you learned or improved? Remember to include both non-technical as well as technical aspects of your job. Non-technical skills include organisation, time-management, confidence, communication etc.

### EBI: Even Better If?
What areas have you identified for improvement in the future? Again, this includes non-technical as well as technical skills.

### Your managers view
If you asked your manager the same questions, would they come up with the same answers? Are there any differences between your view and your managers view of your work? If so, why do they differ?

```md

# Achieving your future {#achieving}

Learning is a lifelong process, a [`while` loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop) in which you continually develop new skills and knowledge. As you loop the loop, you will collect evidence of your personal and professional achievements. Some of these achievements can be certified or ‚Äúbadged‚Äù in various ways. This evidence can be collected as part of your professional identity and reputation, the jar called `ME` in figure \@ref(fig:while-learning-fig).

Evidence is a key part of your ‚ÄúContext, Action, Result and Evidence‚Äù (CARE) story described in section \@ref(care). So what evidence can you collect and how you can certify or badge these credentials, sometimes known as micro-credentials? üìõ  [@microc]

## What you will learn {#ilob}
After reading this chapter you will be able to:

1. Describe some the evidence and micro-credentials you can collect and badge to show your achievements:
    + during University
    + after University and throughout your professional career
1. Identify any gaps in your personal and professional achievements
1. Plan activities and set goals for future achievements that will help you to continue grow professionally and personally

## Academic badges {#academentia}
One kind of badge you get when you finish University is your degree certificate like the one shown in figure \@ref(fig:degree-cert-fig). A degree certificate is an important offline physical (paper) badge that marks a milestone in your career. If you like gaming, its a huge `achievement unlocked` that will take you to the next level. Your certificate also tells people that you were a member of a particular University community and that you mastered your chosen discipline to some level, Bachelors, Masters or PhD.

```{r degree-cert-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiondegreecert)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/a-certificate-is-just-a-badge.png")
```
(ref:captiondegreecert) Level up, achievement unlocked! A degree certificate is a milestone that provides evidence of your academic knowledge and skills gained while at University. [A certificate is just an offline badge](https://bryanmmathers.com/a-certificate-is-just-an-offline-badge/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) via [Doug Belshaw](https://dougbelshaw.com/)

Degree certificates are an important badge, but they don't give very many details of your professional and personal story while at University. You could give more details by providing:

* your overall degree classification: first, second, third etc
* your individual module grades, for example in an academic transcript or by listing them on your CV, see section \@ref(mycved)
* your projects, see section \@ref(mycvpj)
* your portfolio of work, if you have one

This data give a *bit* more detail that a degree certificate does not but it is limited to purely academic achievements. You are *much* more than your grades, because there's a lot about your character that is difficult or impossible to measure, see figure \@ref(fig:more-than-grades-fig).

```{r more-than-grades-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmoregrades)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/i-am-more-than-just-my-grades.png")
```

(ref:captionmoregrades) Your grades give more detail than a degree certificate but they still don't say much about you.

Employers will often want to see more detailed evidence of your character and your softer skills than those provided by degree certificates and grades. While academic achievements paint some broad brushstrokes of your professional identity shown in figure \@ref(fig:fine-grained-fig), they don't help employers see the finer details or much of the evidence.

```{r fine-grained-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfinegrain)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/broad-brushstrokes.png")
```
(ref:captionfinegrain) What kind of picture would you like to paint of your professional identity?

## Digital badges {#digibadge}
Digital badges provide a solution to this problem, just like your degree certificate is a verified badge of your achievements, a digital badge does the same but in a digital way. Rather than being physical, a digital badge is virtual and transferable. It's just a `*.png` graphic file which has been digitally signed and contains metadata. This means it can be displayed on your CV, on social media such as LinkedIn or ‚Äústacked‚Äù into a digital portfolio collection as shown in figure \@ref(fig:badge-properties-fig).

The [Mozilla Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation) have defined an open standard for digital badges [@openbadges] so that badges can be issued, hosted and certified by different organisations. [@belshaw]

```{r badge-properties-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbadgeproperties)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Properties-of-Open-Badges.png")
```
(ref:captionbadgeproperties) Digital badges have certified evidence inside, can be transferred between education and employment and can be stacked into collections or portfolios.  [Properties of Open Badges](https://bryanmmathers.com/properties-open-badges/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licenced under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) for the [City and Guilds of London Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_and_Guilds_of_London_Institute)


A digital badge has certified data locked inside (shown in figure \@ref(fig:data-inside-fig))  which details the achievement it has been awarded for including:

* `recipient` that's you!
* `issuer` the organisation awarding the badge, e.g. [Poppleton University](https://twitter.com/PoppletonUni)
* `badge name` e.g. PASS leader badge (see figure \@ref(fig:pass-leader-fig))
* `badge image` e.g. a digital logo
* `evidence URL` a link to evidence
<!--* `badge URL` a link to the badge e.g. https://badges.cs.manchester.ac.uk/media/uploads/badges/595f24cbab4bd9507882e88f535c4e76.png-->

All this information is coded so that only the recipient and issuer can manipulate it, for example by associating an email address with it.


```{r data-inside-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiondatainside)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/peeled-badge.png")
```
(ref:captiondatainside) Open digital badges have data, like the `issuer` and `recipient`, locked inside them so they can be verified. [There's data inside open badges](https://bryanmmathers.com/open-badges-data-inside/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licenced under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) for the [City and Guilds of London Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_and_Guilds_of_London_Institute)

Anyone such as your University or employer can issue badges, so for example, the University of Manchester issues badges for leaders of its Peer Assisted Study Scheme (PASS) [www.peersupport.manchester.ac.uk](http://www.peersupport.manchester.ac.uk/). An example of a PASS leader badge is shown in figure \@ref(fig:pass-leader-fig).

```{r pass-leader-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionpassleader)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pass-leader-badge.png")
```
(ref:captionpassleader) An example of a digital badge awarded to [Peer Assisted Study Scheme (PASS)](http://www.peersupport.manchester.ac.uk/) leaders at the University of Manchester who have mentored and helped others students during their academic study. If you're a University of Manchester student, you can see other badges available at [wiki.cs.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/Badges](https://wiki.cs.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/Badges) (UoM login required)

Badges can be used for a wide range of different kinds of achievements shown in figure \@ref(fig:badgetype-fig).

1. **Membership** being a member of an organisation or group
1. **Participation** participating in communities
1. **Capability** demonstrating capability with some skill
1. **Mastery** mastering a set of skills


```{r badgetype-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbadgetype)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/badge-taxonomy-v2.png")
```
(ref:captionbadgetype) There are many different achievements which badges can be awarded for including membership, participation, capability and mastery.

## Other digital badges {#otherbadges}
There are other digital badges for evidencing your achievements besides the open ones described in this chapter. Like open badges, they also provide certifiable evidence of professional and personal achievements, see figure \@ref(fig:amazon-badge-fig):

* Amazon Web Services badges [credly.com/organizations/amazon-web-services/badges](https://www.credly.com/organizations/amazon-web-services/badges)
* Certificates from Microsoft and Google, see section \@ref(techie)
* Certificates from edx.org [cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/certificate](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/certificate/)
* Certificates from coursera.org [coursera.org/professional-certificates](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates)
* Certificates from redhat [redhat.com/en/services/certifications](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certifications) etc

Open digital badges let you take your achievements from the many places you learn, and combine them into a portable portfolio that tells a digital story about your learning. The data inside a badge is shown in figure \@ref(fig:skills-bills-fig) and gives an employer a more detailed and evidenced view of your professional development than traditional physical badges like degree certificates.

# Researching your future {#researching}

So you want some more, eh? Your undergraduate degree has whetted your appetite. What are the options for postgraduate study and research? Where can they take you and will further study be worth investing your time and money in? You are a curious character. You like the idea of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge a little further, maybe you even fancy yourself as a modern day [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) or Alan Turing? üë©‚Äçüî¨üë®‚Äçüî¨

```

(ref:captioneinstein) I have no talents, I'm only passionately curious. Are you passionately curious? Is further study or research the right path for you? Are you the next Einstein or Einsteiness? This chapter looks at some of the possibilities for research and further study.

## What you will learn {#ilo12}  
At the end of this chapter you will be able to:

1. Describe the costs of postgraduate study and research
1. Discuss the benefits of postgraduate study and research


## Where to start {#finda}  
A good place to start if you're looking for a masters or PhD are:

* Apply directly to Universities for postgraduate study, if there is a specific group or course you are interested in. See also:
* [findamasters.com](https://www.findamasters.com/) for postgraduate study, a directory of Masters degrees and postgraduate qualifications at universities around the world
* [findaphd.com](https://www.findaphd.com/) for postgraduate research, a large database of PhD opportunities
* [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/) also lists PhD opportunities, not just in the UK, see [jobs.ac.uk/phd](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/phd)

## University or the Real World? {#realworld}
When you graduate, you might think you need to choose between University or the ‚Äú[real world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life)‚Äù, see figure \@ref(fig:realworld-fig). That's a popular misconception and a false dichotomy. In computing it is common for people to cross back and forth several times between industry (the so-called real world) and academia (the [ivory towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_tower)).

```{r realworld-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionrealworld)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/University-or-real-world.png")
```

(ref:captionrealworld) Which path will you choose, University or the real world? Perhaps you can you have both? How many times can you [zigzag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigzag) between the two? Real world sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Commercial or real-world experience is valuable in academia and academic experience is valuable beyond academia. So, if you think you need to choose between the two, think again. Doing an internship or placement with a commercial company can be useful background for a career in academia, both in research and teaching. Lots of research is done in partnerships between commercial companies and Universities, some of these create [startups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company), [University spin-offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_spin-off) or [corporate spin-offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off) etc.

Your learning shouldn't stop when you finish University either, so you might work for a bit, study for a bit, work a bit more and so on. Some of this learning might be formal and academic with qualifications, others might be badged in different ways. This is called [lifelong learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning), see section \@ref(lifelonglearning) and chapter \@ref(achieving).

So will you choose University **OR** real life in the longer term? With all the [squiggles and zigzags](https://www.amazingif.com/listen/), your career is likely to be a bit more complicated than that... [@squigglybook;]


<!--PhD grind

## Ask beyond academia {#prof}
If you're thinking about doing a PhD and going into research, it's obviously a good idea to talk to Professors and academics about what is involved. Don't just ask Professors though, talk to PhD students, [postdocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) and especially people who did a PhD but didn't go into academia. Most people with a PhD don't go on into academia as a career. [@postdochell] This means that asking a Professor if you should do a PhD is a bit like asking a Hollywood film star if you should become an actor. The film star can only give you part of the story that is likely to suffer from [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). [@therock]

## Signposts from here on research {#rsignposts}

A good place to start if you're thinking about doing a PhD (or trying to get through one) is *How to get your PhD: A Handbook for the Journey* by [Gavin Brown](https://twitter.com/profgavinbrown). [@howtogetyourphd]


```{r eval=knitr::is_html_output(excludes = "epub"), gavinbrown-fig,echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "test caption"}

```


I wish I'd had this book when I was a PhD student! I'm not just saying that because Gavin is a colleague of mine but this is a genuinely useful book which quickly tackles a wide range of issues you'll encounter during a PhD from the technical to the psychological. The second half also contains a range of short viewpoints on doing a PhD from people including [Nancy Rothwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Rothwell), [Victoria Burns](https://twitter.com/drvikkiburns), [Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber), [Lucy Kissick](https://www.lucykissick.co.uk/), [Hiranya Peiris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiranya_Peiris), [Melanie Leng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Leng), [Jeremy Wyatt](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jlw/), [David Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hand_(statistician)), [Carolyn Virca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolyn-virca-3446b558/), [Shakir Mohamed](https://shakirm.com/), [Jonny Brooks-Bartlett](https://medium.com/@jonnybrooks04) and [Jennifer Polk](https://fromphdtolife.com/). If you're serious about doing a PhD, you should read Gavin's guidebook.

# (PART) SUPPORTING {-}  

# Ruling your future {#ruling}  

In 2005, the scientist and engineer [Phil Bourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Bourne) starting publishing a series of articles which distilled people's hard won knowledge into *[Ten Simple Rules](https://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules)*. [@Bourne2005] Over a decade more than 1000 rules were published in over 100 articles in the scientific journal *[PLOS Computational Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_Computational_Biology)*. [@Bourne2018] These articles offer a huge range of advice from making the most of a summer internship [@Aicher2017] to teaching programming [@tensimplebrown] and even winning a Nobel Prize. [@Roberts2015] Articles as lists, or ‚Äú[listicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle)‚Äù as they are sometimes known, are a convenient way to summarise key points. So here are *Ten Simple Rules for Coding Your Future*: the too long, didn't read ([TL;DR](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read)) summary of this guidebook.

```{r ten-simple-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiontensimple)"}

(ref:captiontensimple) Ten Simple rules for coding your future.

## Know who you are {#mybrand}

There is a lot more to you than your degree. Yes, you've spent (or will be spending) three or four years getting your degree. Use this time to identify your weaknesses and work out how to improve them. Knowing your future depends on knowing who you are now, see chapter \@ref(knowing) and figure \@ref(fig:knowing-fig).

<!--understand your brand your values, another word for brand is reputation. do people like you. The better you know yourself, the better-->


## Look after yourself {#onlyhuman}
Studying at University can be enjoyable but it can also make you stressed, anxious and depressed. If you neglect to look after yourself mentally and physically, things can start to fall apart. Choose your reference points carefully, try not to compare yourself to the person at the top of the class: see Carmen's advice in chapter \@ref(carmen). Ask yourself, am I doing better than last time? Be kind to yourself because nurturing yourself now will nurture your future, see chapter \@ref(nurturing).

```{r lookafter-again-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionlookafteragain)"}

## Use what you have {#gregwilson}

It's too easy to fall into a trap of thikning *if I had...* when job hunting. Use what you already have, see figure \@ref(fig:usewhatyouhave-fig).

```{r usewhatyouhave-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionusewhatyouhave)"}

This rule is borrowed from software engineer Greg Wilson [\@gvwilson](https://github.com/gvwilson) in figure \@ref(fig:greg-wilson-fig), who probably adapted it from a quote frequently misattributed to Theodore Roosevelt [@teddy].

When you're job hunting, it can be competitive and cut-throat. You might find yourself falling into poor habits of mind:

* ‚Äú*If I had a better degree from a different university, I'd be more successful...*‚Äù see section \@ref(entitled)
* ‚Äú*If I had more experience, more voluntary work, more internships, I'd stand a better chance...*‚Äù see section \@ref(areuexperienced)
* ‚Äú*If I'd done more projects and extra-curricular activities...*‚Äù etc see section \@ref(mycvpj)
* ‚Äú*If I'd got better grades at school and Uni...*‚Äù see section \@ref(academentia)
* ‚Äú*If only I'd worked harder...*‚Äù see \@ref(regret)
* ‚Äú*If I was more confident at speaking and interviews ... *‚Äù see chapter \@ref(speaking) on *Speaking your future*
* ‚Äú*If I'd been to a different school, I could be more successful...*‚Äù see the [93percent.club](https://www.93percent.club/) [@93bbc; @93guardian]

Coulda. Woulda. Shoulda. This is all the usual dialogue you can expect from your inner critic. Acknowledge these thoughts, see section \@ref(lays), then try distance yourself from them. Start from where you are, use whatever you have and help who you can.

## Grow your networks {#networking}

Grow your networks, make use of all the contacts you have and foster new connections where you can. Improve the connections you already have by spending time talking to people and hearing what they have to say. People can help you, *especially* those you're not particularly close to, see figure \@ref(fig:yournetwork-fig)

```{r yournetwork-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionyournetwork)"}

Remember that the weaker ties in your network (see section \@ref(weakties)) may be more important than your stronger ties, especially when it comes to finding jobs. [It's not (just) what you know, but *who* you know](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it%27s_not_what_you_know_but_who_you_know).

## Always make new mistakes {#estherdyson}

You can classify your mistakes and failures into two categories:

1. Productive mistakes: those you learnt from
1. Unproductive mistakes: those you didn't learn anything from (and risk repeating)

Mistakes and failure are inevitable in life, but productive mistakes are going to help you much more that unproductive ones [@henrypetroski]. That doesn't just mean  you should ‚Äú*fail fast, fail often*‚Äù [@failfast] or ‚Äú*move fast and break things*‚Äù, but to consciously learn from any mistakes you make so that you don't repeat them.  One way to turn unproductive mistakes into productive ones is deliberately and consciously reflect on why you made them. This is part of the growth mindset we discussed in chapter \@ref(nurturing).

In a growth mindset, mistakes can be good, but the fear of making them is not. You are more likely to take more chances when you're unafraid to fail, and this will improve your chances of success.

Many education systems around the world don't teach people how to fail, because they put too much emphasis on success (as measured by grades and rewards) rather than progress, learning and happiness. [@failgift; @punished] So as the angel investor [Esther Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson) once said, ‚ÄúAlways make new mistakes‚Äù, see figure \@ref(fig:esther-dyson-fig)

```{r esther-dyson-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionestherdyson)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/esther-dyson-always-make-new-mistakes.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionestherdyson) Mistakes are inevitable in life, so there's no shame in making them especially if they are new. Making *new* mistakes can be a form of productive failure that you learn from rather than a source of unproductive failure that you repeat (old mistakes). Portrait of [Esther Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson) by Christopher Michel (CC BY-SA) via Wikimedia commons [w.wiki/3TEY](https://w.wiki/3TEY) adapted using the [Wikipedia App](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238).

So:

* If you've got some harsh feedback on your CV, how can you make less buggy in the future?
* If you've applied to lots of companies and not even had a reply yet, how you improve your job search strategy?
* If you've neglected to develop interests and projects outside of work, how can you rebalance?
* If you crashed and burned in an interview, how can you use the experience to do better next time?
* If you failed to get the promotion you thought you deserved, what will you do differently in the future


## Help and thank who you can {#gratitude}

There are good reasons to be grateful, showing gratitude doesn't just help other people, it helps you too see figure \@ref(fig:helpandthank-fig)

```{r helpandthank-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionhelp)"}

Join a team by helping someone, be a team player, help others, thank others for their help.


## Look beyond the obvious {#beyond}

Be flexible in approach. Don't just target big employers that you've heard of, there are plenty of startups and smaller organisations you've never heard of who have lots to offer, see figure \@ref(fig:binoculars-fig)

```{r binoculars-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbinoculars)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Look beyond the obvious.png")

It's not just London (see chapter \@ref(moving)), and other big cities. Look beyond graduate schemes, look beyond graduate jobs. Broaden your horizons and your job search, see chapter \@ref(broadening).

You are not just a techie, Either.

## Stay in school {#lifelonglearning}

Part of what you learn during your education is *how* to learn. But your learning shouldn't finish when you leave University, see figure \@ref(fig:stayinschool-fig) chapter \@ref(achieving)

```{r stayinschool-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionstayinschool)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Stay in school.png")
```
(ref:captionstayinschool) Stay in school because learning is a lifelong process, a `while loop` in which you continuously develop new skills and knowledge.

Computer science is a young and rapidly changing discipline which means you can not afford to be left behind. Never stop learning, see chapter \@ref(achieving).




## Step outside your comfort zone {#comfy}

Am I being insensitive asking people to step outside their comfort zone when we've all be stretched beyond breaking point during COVID-19, climate change and global economic turmoil? We're all going to need to continue to step outside of our respective comfort zones in order to meet the challenges we face around the world, see figure \@ref(fig:comfortzone-fig).

```{r comfortzone-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "(ref:captioncomfortzone)"}

(ref:captioncomfortzone) You learn and grow more when you step outside your comfort zone. Comfort zone sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)


This takes courage, but that's often when you learn most. So step outside your comfort zone if you're feeling brave enough to learn.

## Don't give up {#nevergiveup}

<!--APPLY, bouncing back. It's tempting to shutdown and give up. Don't be tempted, reboot, regroup, reflect and keep going.-->

Job hunting is hard. Job hunting is stressful. Job hunting is time consuming. Some employers will waste your valuable time, see section \@ref(timesink). Some employers will reject you but try not to take it personally, see \@ref(rejection). Job hunting may affect your mental health, see chapter \@ref(nurturing). The important thing is to not give up, see figure \@ref(fig:katebush-fig). Try to make any failure productive, rather than unproductive, see section \@ref(estherdyson).

```{r katebush-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionkatebush)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dont-give-up-bush-gabriel.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionkatebush) You were taught to fight, taught to win, perhaps you never thought you could fail? Don't give up, because you have friends. Don't give up, you're not beaten yet. Don't give up, I know you can make it good.

[@dontgiveup]


<!--Don't give up learning either, stay in school. Science and engineering are fast moving fields with constant change. While your degree has hopefully armed you with a range of fundamental generic skills that will last your lifetime, you will constantly need to learn new things.-->

# Hacking your future {#hacking}

It's very easy to overlook mistakes in your own writing because its difficult to be both and *author* and an *editor* of the same text. That's true of any written communication such as a covering letter, personal statement, email or any message that you write. Mistakes are particularly common in CVs (or r√©sum√©s) because you can spend *hours* carefully polishing the words and the formatting but not see a fatal error at the top of page one. Hacking^[The term [hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(disambiguation)) is a horribly overloaded word with many different meanings, but I'm using it here to mean an ‚Äúingenious temporary solution to a problem‚Äù] other people's CV's will help you improve your own. You may need to use ingenious hacks like the temporary fix to the bridge in figure \@ref(fig:kludge-fig). Fixing other peoples bridges will help you improve your own bridges, see section \@ref(parti). You'll build better bridges to more interesting and ambitious destinations.

```{r kludge-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionkludge)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bridge-kludge-hack.png")
```
(ref:captionkludge) Your CV is a bridge which enables you to cross from where you are now to where you'd like to be in the future. Like the bridge in this picture, the CV's in this chapter are all faulty in some way, can you fix them? You may need to use ingenious hacks and [kludges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge) like the one shown here on the [Million Dollar Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Glacier_Bridge) in Alaska . Public domain image of kludgy repairs adapted from an original by [Jet Lowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Lowe) on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3Uvn](https://w.wiki/3Uvn)


## Hack their CVs

A useful hacking technique is to take somebody elses stuff and fix or improve it. That works for written communication as well as actual `code`. The dogfooding technique described in section \@ref(dogfooding) is a useful hack which you can use by:

1. Eating your *own* dogfood by reading your own written work ALOUD <!--self assess using the rubric-->
1. Eating *somebody elses* dogfood by:
    - Hacking a friends or peers CV by swapping with them and giving them constructive feedback
    - Hacking the fictitious CVs below by ranking them against a job advert  in section \@ref(cooltech). Who would you want to interview and why?
1. Eating your own dogfood again, re-reading and re-editing repeatedly
1. Persuade someone else to eat your dogfood - get feedback from as many people (and bots see section \@ref(robotproof)) as you can

So, here are some fictitious CVs for you to hack, from students of Computer Science. They are based on CVs I've seen, warts and all, with personal information removed and anonymised. Can you spot their triumphs and tragedies? Can fix their CVs and work out which candidate is best for the sample job description at CoolTech in section \@ref(cooltech)? Can you hack their future?

Special thanks to [Toby Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Howard) and [Sean Bechhofer](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/sean.bechhofer/) for coming up with some of these silly names for fictional students in computing. Please direct any complaints about the terribly geeky puns to Toby and Sean! Can you spot all the bad jokes? Thanks also Ben Carter and Penny Gordon Lanes in the careers service at the University of Manchester, some of these CVs are based on examples they have collected and anonymised. üôè

## Breakpoints
(ref:breakpoint)

```md
* PAUSE ‚è∏Ô∏è
```

When you read these CVs make a note of:

1. **What Went Well?** (`WWW`) What do you like about any given CV, what have they done well?
1. **Even Better If?** (`EBI`) What could be fixed or improved, can you hack it?
1. **Their Rank order** (`1,2,3...`) Who is top of your list to interview? Who is going in the bin and why?

```md
* RESUME ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
```
<!-- also use the CV rubric and CV checklist-->

Imagine the person is real, what would you tell them about their CV if they'd given it to you for advice without hurting their feelings? How could you be a critical friend by giving them actionable feedback?

## Sample CVs

Hacking other people's CVs will help you improve your own because you're putting yourself in the shoes of your reader. Here are some samples:

### Penelope Tester {#pen-tester}

Penny Tester, or Pen as her friends call her, loves cybersecurity and [reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering). She has a real passion for finding vulnerabilities in software and hardware. Just don't call her a hacker she hates that word, see \@ref(fig:pentester-fig).

### Peter Byte {#peter-byte}

Peter and his [twin sister Peta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peta_(given_name)), both love big data, machine learning, statistics, data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI). They come from a big family with nine siblings, [Deca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deca-), [Hector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecto-), [Kilo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo-), [Megan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega-), [Giga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giga-), [Terry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tera-), [Exa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exa-), [Zita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zetta-) and [Yotta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yotta-). They are wildly ambitious, but critics say the Byte family have been terribly over-hyped, see figure \@ref(fig:peterbyte-fig).

```{r peterbyte-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionpeter)"}

### Polina Morphism {#polly-morphism}

Polly *loves* object-oriented programming. She has lots of siblings, and [a cousin called Isa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism). Instead of a CV or r√©sum√©, Polly has put some basic details on her LinkedIn profile which she primarily uses for professional social networking, see figure \@ref(fig:polly-fig).

### Neil Pointer {#neil-pointer}

Neil is a mature student who loves the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), see figure \@ref(fig:neilpointer-fig). The Pointer family are sometimes misunderstood, but Neil compensates for this with his excellent memory management skills and efficiency. As well as [his famous sisters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pointer_Sisters), he has a younger half-brother, Neil Pointer-Exception, from his mothers second marriage. Neil Pointer-Exception prefers `Java`. Neil has seen many programming languages come and go, but his favourite will always be `C`.

# Moving your future {#moving}

Finding a job often involves moving to another city or even another country. So a simple way to improve your job prospects is to broaden your job search (chapter \@ref(finding)) and consider all the alternatives, geographically and otherwise. Some of the alternative options are outlined in chapter \@ref(broadening). This chapter looks at some UK alternatives to London.

```{r northern-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "32%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionnojustlondon)"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/notjustlondon.jpg", 3))
```

(ref:captionnojustlondon) Like many capital cities, London dominates the economy of its country. There are clearly some fantastic employers offering great opportunities in London but they do not represent everything that is on offer in the UK. There are plenty of good career options outside of capital cities like London if you don't want to live and work in a huge metropolis. The transition to [remote and hybrid working](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work)  also means you don't **have** to live in a large city. Not just London Image by Sharon Dale [@notjustlondon]


## Hit the South? {#south}
For example, if you're seeking work or further study in the United Kingdom, there are lots of possibilities in [Loxbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxbridge) (**Lo**ndon, **Ox**ford and Cam**bridge**). While Loxbridge undoubtedly offers many fantastic opportunities for your professional growth and development, it does not represent *all* of the best opportunities that exist in the UK see figure \@ref(fig:northern-fig).

<!--LOxbridge is a fortified triangular castle bound London and its two most significant suburbs, Oxford and Cambridge.-->


## Hit the North! {#north}
If you're looking for a job in the UK you don't have to exclusively target the South (London) to find top employers, there are plenty located in the North too: [Hit the North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_the_North). [@hitthenorth]


::: {.rmdcaution}
**Looking for Northern jobs in the UK?**

See a partial list of tech employers at **[git.io/manc](https://git.io/manc)**

<!--This list of is currently being migrated from [dullhunk/book](https://github.com/dullhunk/book) to [dullhunk/cdyf](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf) - in the meantime, see the list at git.io/manc)-->

:::

Northerners have often argued that Northern England offers a better quality of life than London we couldn't possibly comment other than to say its horses for courses. The North West Tech Community calendar, provides a window on (and networking opportunities with) many of employers based in the North West [technw.uk](https://technw.uk) if you want to find out more. As Sharon Dale once said: its NotJustLondon [@notjustlondon]

So, it's wrong to assume that capital cities like London are where *all* the best opportunities are. That's true in the UK and also in many other countries too, and the rise of working from home during the pandemic has changed our relationship with cities. You might need to consider moving your future.

This is a partial list of employers in the North West of England (aka the [Northern Powerhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Powerhouse)) that recruit Computer Science students. This is not a comprehensive list of all tech companies in the North West, but will give you a quick flavour of employers in the Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Northern England.

## Hit the East and West {#eastwest}
It's not just the North or the South either: You should also hit the East and the West too, don't just look at big cities. Don't just look at big employers. Look beyond the obvious, chapter \@ref(broadening) may help broaden your job search horizons.

In addition to these [techuk.org](https://www.techuk.org) and [technation.io](https://technation.io) provide more information on technology businesses outside of London.

## Summarising moving your future {#tldr16}
The best jobs are not always in the obvious places. The myth that all the best graduate jobs are in London (or Paris, Berlin, Silly Valley etc) is clearly not the case, see figure \@ref(fig:uuk-fig).

```{r uuk-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionuuk)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/uuk.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionuuk) It's a myth that all the best graduate jobs are in London and other capital cities or centres for technical innovation like [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley), [Silicon Alley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Alley) or [Silicon Fen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Fen). For some more misleading myths see the [universitiesuk.ac.uk](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/) report on *[Busting Graduate Job Myths](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/what-we-do/policy-and-research/publications/busting-graduate-job-myths)* introduced in section \@ref(entitled). [@ballmyths]

So a simple way to broaden your future and open up more possibilities is to consider all the geographical options. Move your future by looking beyond the obvious:

* Hit the North!
* Hit the South!
* Hit the East!
* Hit the West!

<!--chapter:end:16-moving.Rmd-->

# Enjoying your future {#enjoying}
Music is deeply connected to your mental health and your sense of wellbeing that we discussed in chapter \@ref(nurturing). Music has the ability to comfort and connect you to yourself and to others. It provides motivation, gratification and empathy. There's also lot of wisdom captured in the lyrics of many songs too, not just entertainment, but good advice on how you can live your life. If that wasn't enough convince you that music is important for coding your future, there's no shortage of links between mathematics and music too. [@behindthemusic]

This chapter explores all the musical references in this guidebook in a series of playlists which are accompanied with some explanation and context.

In *Hearing your Future* (chapter \@ref(hearing)) we ask our guests to recommend a tune that is important to them. These are gathered into *The Coder‚Äôs Playlist* and incremented with every new episode of the podcast: it's `Music++`.

## Lancashire boy bands {#lancs}
This playlist starts and ends with one of the best known [boy bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band) on the planet: [The Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles) shown in figure \@ref(fig:the-beatles-fig). You will find plenty of other Lancashire lads and even the occasional Lancashire [lass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lass) in here too. But hang on a second, which cities are actually *in* Lancashire, I hear you say? Don't let bureaucrats trick you into believing that:

* Manchester is in a place called *[Greater Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester)*
* Liverpool is in a place called *[Merseyside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside)*

These are *meaningless* bureaucratic abstractions, not **real places**! Liverpool and Manchester have always been, and will always be, in [Lancashire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire). [@northerners]

## Electronica {#electronica}
This playlist celebrates [electronica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronica) and other computationally influenced music. In 1951, engineers of the [Ferranti Mark 1 computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1), implemented a `hoot` function that was used to sound a prompt when input was required. Alan Turing realised that this could be reprogrammed to make different notes and created a routine that played a note of a specified pitch.

```

(ref:captiondraughts) Is this the worlds first [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game)? Christopher Strachey's draughts game displayed on a cathode ray tube in 1952. When the game finished, the [Ferranti Mark 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1) which ran the game, played a tune. Public domain image from Wikimedia Commons at [w.wiki/5UJs](https://w.wiki/5UJs)

Using Turing's code the computer scientist [Christopher Strachey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Strachey) wrote programs to play music. Strachey's first success was a version of the UK's national anthem *God Save the Queen* [@godsavethequeen] which was played at the end of what is probably the first video ever game created, [draughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers) shown in figure \@ref(fig:draughts-fig). [@programmingenter] The earliest existing recording of computer-generated music was made in 1951 by the BBC, in which the [Ferranti Mark 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1) can be heard playing three songs:

1. *[God Save the Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen)* [@godsavethequeen]
1. *[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baa,_Baa,_Black_Sheep)* [@baabaablacksheep]
1. *[In the Mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Mood)* [@inthemood]

You can hear this music which was restored by [Jack Copeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Copeland) and Jason Long in 2016. [@restoringmusic]

Computers have been changing the way we create, distribute and listen to music ever since. Sing like no one is listening, love like you never been hurt and dance like no one is watching.

## Dad rock {#dadrock}
Using the medium of rock, this playlist grumpily reminds you that ‚Äú*when I was your age*‚Äù music was much better and it's all gone downhill since the good old days. Nostalgia isn't what it used to be but these classics were made by *true* artists using proper musical instruments. None of this electronic nonsense thanks you very much.

Cherished by men of a certain age, the Dad rock playlist thrives on past glories but is a shadow of it's former self. Proponents of Dad rock can't understand why more people don't enjoy these classic and seminal tunes of yesteryear. [@dadrock; @dadrock2]

Muddier than the traditional summer downpour at the [Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival), this playlist encourages you to swing your cardigan mournfully while [shoegazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze) and wondering if its *ever* going to stop raining, either metaphorically or meteorologically. ‚òîÔ∏è

# Actioning your future {#actioning}

Employers are often more interested in what you have *done*, rather than what you just *know*. Your actions are a key part of your story we discussed in section \@ref(care). A simple technique for emphasising the `action` in your stories is to lead  descriptions of your projects, education and experience with carefully chosen `verbs`, see section \@ref(verbsfirst) for examples.

## Your actions define your impact {#impact}
Your actions define your impact, see figure \@ref(fig:action-fig). What stories you can tell of your actions to date? What verbs best describe how you achieved a result or had an impact? What was the context, action, result and evidence (CARE) we discussed in section \@ref(care) of each (short) story?

```{r action-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionactions)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/your-actions.png")
```
(ref:captionactions) What action have you taken and what stories can you tell about the results and your impact? What are the best verbs for highlighting your actions? [Your actions define your impact](https://bryanmmathers.com/your-actions-define-your-impact/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) via [Angela Maiers](https://twitter.com/AngelaMaiers)

By leading with verbs you will highlight what you have *actually done* and how you did it, rather than what you know. See the verbs first section \@ref(verbsfirst) of chapter \@ref(debugging) *debugging your future*.

## What you will learn {#ilo17}

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

1. Emphasise your *actions* when describing your education, projects and experience
1. Reflect on
    + what skills you already have
    + what skills you need to develop
1. Demonstrate those skills explicitly and quickly in job applications

## Breakpoints {#bp17}
(ref:breakpoint)

```md
* PAUSE ‚è∏Ô∏è
```

Quickly scan your CV, covering letter or application form for VERBS:

* Where are the verbs?
    + buried deep in long sections of prose? **OR**
    + prominently leading descriptions of your activities?
* Have you over-used certain verbs (like `worked` or `assisted` for example) or been repetitive (like over-using `developed` see alternatives in section \@ref(engineering))
* How can you increase the variety of verbs you have used (without exaggerating or lying)?
* Which verbs are stronger than others and why?
* Are there any categories of verbs you can't provide evidence for, such as leadership (see section \@ref(leading)) or influencing (see section \@ref(influencing))?
    + What activities or projects could you do that would help you develop these missing skills?

```md
* RESUME ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
```

## Summarising your actions
(ref:tldr)

Actions speak louder than words, or as suffragette and political activist [Emmeline Pankhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst) frequently said ‚ÄúDeeds not Words‚Äù, see figure \@ref(fig:pankhurst-fig). Your CV needs to emphasise your deeds and actions using words. Those words are `verbs`.

```{r pankhurst-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionpankhurst)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/deeds-not-words-pankhurst.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionpankhurst) ‚ÄúDeeds not words‚Äù was the rallying cry of suffragette [Emmeline Pankhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst). Emphasise the deeds (actions) on your CV by leading your stories with carefully chosen `verbs`. Public domain image of Emmeline Pankhurst by Richard Gordon Matzene restored by Adam Cuerden on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3bPa](https://w.wiki/3bPa) and adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Leading with `verbs` is a simple but powerful technique that enables you to provide evidence (rather than assertion) for the skills and knowledge you have. Choose your `verbs` carefully. Which verbs are missing from your CV? These verbs can help you identify gaps in your professional and personal development.

<!--chapter:end:18-actioning.Rmd-->

# Scheduling your future {#scheduling}
You might find it a bit scary thinking about your future. You might be tempted to procrastinate making important decisions about your future, see figure \@ref(fig:schedule-fig). There is a risk of getting stuck in a `do-nothing` or [`busy waiting`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting) loop. This guidebook is here to help you break out of that loop. One way to breakout of an unproductive loop is to schedule some time every week where you work on personal development and job applications. Doing good applications takes time and you'll probably find you can't do as many applications as you might like.

```{r schedule-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionschedule)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/is-it-just-me.png")
```
(ref:captionschedule) The biggest waste of time is the time spent not getting started on a project. Your future might seem big and unknown but it's really not as scary as you might think and getting started can be surprisingly enjoyable. [New Project?

If you're preparing to come on the show, please have a think about the following questions:

### What's your story, coding glory? {#your-story}
With apologies to the Noel Gallagher and Liam Gallagher, see figure \@ref(fig:gallagher2-fig)):

> ‚ÄúAll your dreams are made, when you're chained to [the tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue-tracking_systems) and the software trade. What's your story, coding glory?‚Äù --The Gallagher Brothers

What's your story?

* What's your name and where do you come from? [@blinddate]
* Why did you choose to study computer science?
* Which organisation were you employed by, why and how did you choose them
* What were the main obstacles you faced finding employment and how did you overcome them?
* Tell us about your roles and responsibilities within the organisation
* How did you find the job and what other jobs did they look for?
* What were the main things you learned on placement?
* What was the most enjoyable or rewarding part of working for your employer?
* What did you do for your final year project?
* What comes next?

### Minority report {#minority}
This is an optional question taken from the title of the [Philip K. Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick) novel *[The Minority Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minority_Report)* and subsequent film adaptation, see figure \@ref(fig:minority-fig). Minority report asks our guests:

* Do you consider yourself to be a member of a minority group?
* If so which one(s), see section \@ref(protected) and \@ref(genderid)?
* What has your experience been of being in a minority at University and in the workplace?
* How can the teaching and learning of computer science be made more [equitable, diverse and inclusive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion) for members of your minority group(s)?
* What else can universities do to make campuses more welcoming to members of your minority group(s)?
* What more can employers do to make workplaces more welcoming to members of your minority group(s)?

### One tune, one podcast and one film {#otopof}

We love our music, films and podcasts and make gratuitous references to them throughout *Coding your Future*. Critics say our playlist in chapter \@ref(enjoying) is clogged up with:

* Lancashire boy bands, see section \@ref(lancs)
* [DadRock](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dad-Rock/dp/B09F6GQSKK) and [BritPop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britpop), see \@ref(dadrock)
* cardigan-swinging, [shoe-gazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze), [glastonbury-going](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival) [indie music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock), see \@ref(indie)
* music made with digital computers rather than analogue instruments, see \@ref(electronica)
* other antiquities from a bygone era [@dadrock2]

So, can you recommend a:

* **TUNE!** One tune to rejuvenate or internationlise up our playlists. Why is it important to you?
    - Perhaps it makes you relax, feel happy or comforted?
    - Maybe it reminds you of special people, a special time or special place in your life?
    - We'll add it to *The Coder's Playlist* in section \@ref(coders)
* **PODCAST:** One podcast you‚Äôve enjoyed that you‚Äôd recommend our listeners subscribe to üéß
* **FILM:** One film we‚Äôve got to go and watch right now, old or new üçø

### Time traveller {#your-time}

Do you wish that you knew what you know now, when you were younger? Just like [Ronnie Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Lane), [Ronnie Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Wood) and [Rod Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Stewart), we all probably feel that way sometimes, see figure \@ref(fig:faces2-fig). So, if you could travel back in time to meet the younger you, just starting University:

* What would you tell your former self, now that you are older and wiser?
* What would you tell current students to help them get the most of their preciously short time at University?

```{r faces2-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfaces2)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/faces.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionfaces2) Poor old grandad I laughed at all his words but I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger, see [Ooh La La](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_La_La_(Faces_song)).

# Reading your future {#reading}
<!-- was References -->

If you want to have your future read, you can read all about it right here. There is no need to gaze into any [crystal balls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_ball)! These books, journals, websites, magazines will help you to read your future. So read your future, because reading is good for your mind, body and soul. [Libraries give us power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Design_for_Life) [@librariesgiveuspower], see figure \@ref(fig:library-power-fig).

```{r library-power-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionlibpower)"}

```
(ref:captionlibpower) Libraries give you power, the power to read your future. These references are your digital library to search and browse.

This chapter lists everything (and I mean *everything*) cited in this book which you might find overwhelming. For a more easily digestible versions see the shorter ‚Äúsignposts‚Äù section of any chapter in this book and see Gavin Brown's chapter on how to read critically. Critical thinking and critical reading are valuable skills, not just for PhD students and not just for reading scientific papers either. So as [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) puts it read a lot (see figure \@ref(fig:billgates-fig)) but read critically too. [@howtoread]

(ref:captionbillgates) ‚ÄúI was recently asked what advice I would give to young people who want to make a positive impact on the world ... My advice is simple: Read a lot and discover a skill you enjoy. For some, that means being great at science or a great communicator. There‚Äôs so much opportunity to do good in the world.‚Äù [@gatesread] CC BY portrait of Bill Gates by Kuhlmann / MSC on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3W7k](https://w.wiki/3W7k)
