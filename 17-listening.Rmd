### What's your story, coding glory? {#wyscg}
* Tell us a bit about you and where you come from
* Why did you choose to study computer science?
* Which organisation were you employed by, why and how did you choose them
* Tell us about your role in the organisation
* How did you find the job and what other jobs did they look for?
* What were the main things you learned on placement?
* What was the most enjoyable or rewarding part of working for your employer

* What else can universities (and employers) do to make campuses (and workplaces) more welcoming for members of your minority group?

### One tune, one podcast and one film {#otopof}

There are far too many gratuitous musical references in *Coding your Future* itâ€™s mostly [DadRock](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a29419783/what-is-dad-rock/) and other antique pieces. [@dadrock] So can you recommend us:

* One tune to rejuvenate and freshen up our playlist. Why is it important to you? Perhaps itâ€™s a tune that makes you relax, feel happy, comforted, reminds you of home, family, friends etc
* One podcast youâ€™ve enjoyed to that youâ€™d recommend our listeners subscribe to
* One film weâ€™ve got to go and watch right now

### Time travel
* Advice to your former self, what would you tell yourself in first and second year now that you are older and wiser?
