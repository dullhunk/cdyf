If you want to have your future read, you can read all about it right here. There is no need to gaze into any [crystal balls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_ball)! These books, journals, websites, magazines will help you to read your future. So read your future, because reading is good for your mind, body and soul.

This chapter lists everything (and I mean *everything*) cited in this book which you might find overwhelming. For a more easily digestible versions see the shorter “signposts” section of any chapter in this book and see Gavin Brown's chapter on how to read critically. Critical thinking and critical reading are valuable skills, not just for PhD students and not just for reading scientific papers either. So as [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) puts it read a lot, see figure \@ref(fig:billgates-fig) and read critically too. [@howtoread]

(ref:captionbillgates) “I was recently asked what advice I would give to young people who want to make a positive impact on the world ... My advice is simple: Read a lot and discover a skill you enjoy. For some, that means being great at science or a great communicator. There’s so much opportunity to do good in the world.” [@gatesread] CC BY portrait of Bill Gates by Kuhlmann / MSC on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3W7k](https://w.wiki/3W7k)
