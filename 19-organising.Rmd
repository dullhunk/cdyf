# Organising your future {#organising}
You might find it a bit scary thinking about your future. You might be tempted to procrastinate making important decisions about your future, see figure \@ref(fig:schedule-fig). There is a risk of [thrashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)) or getting stuck in a `do-nothing` or [`busy waiting`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting) loop. This guidebook is here to help you break out of that loop. One way to breakout of an unproductive loop is to organise and schedule some time every week where you work on personal development and job applications. Doing good applications takes time and you'll probably find you can't do as many applications as you might like.

```{r schedule-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionschedule)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/is-it-just-me.png")
```
(ref:captionschedule) The biggest waste of time is the time spent not getting started on a project. Your future might seem big and unknown but it's really not as scary as you might think and getting started can be surprisingly enjoyable. [New Project?

If you're a University of Manchester student, the live *Coding your Future* (COMP2CARS) workshops sessions are also here to help, every Monday at 5pm.  COMP2CARS complements the second year tutorials (COMP2TUT) at the University of Manchester and takes place in the same slot as COMP2TUT when you meet your personal tutor. See your timetable at [timetables.manchester.ac.uk](https://timetables.manchester.ac.uk/).

In semester 2, from January to June 2023, these slots run as drop in sessions in LF25, for second year students only.

## Summarising your organisation {#tldr19}
(ref:tldr)

Your future is bright, your future needs organising. Organising your future will help you deploy your future. Deploying your future will help to start coding your future. 

If you're a University of Manchester student, there are scheduled synchronous live sessions which complement the content of this guidebook. 

Outside of that, its a good idea to organise some scheduled time to work on continuous professional development (CPD), particularly the not very scary and actuall quite enjoyable tasks of designing, building, testing, coding and deploying your future. 

In the next part, chapter \@ref(hearing): *Hearing your Future* we meet students who are doing just that.
