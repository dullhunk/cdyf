# (PART) TESTING YOUR FUTURE {-}

# Debugging your future {#debugging}

It's all very well *designing* your future but now you need to actually *engineer* your future by building something. An obvious place to start is with your CV or r√©sum√©, because that's where most people start testing their designs. Just like with code, the hardest part isn't *writing* it but *debugging* and *rewriting* it, repeatedly. How can you create a bug-free CV, r√©sum√© or completed application form? How can you support applications with a strong personal statement or covering letter? These documents are a crucial part of your future so how can you debug them? üï∑

knitr::include_graphics("images/Features not bugs.png")
```

(ref:captionbuggingcv) Is that a bug or a feature in your CV? To stand a chance of being invited to interview, you'll need to identify and fix any bugs in your written applications. If you don't, your application risks being sucked into a black hole and will never be seen again.

Your future is bright, your future needs debugging, so let's start debugging your future. 

## What you will learn {#ilo7}  

By the end of this chapter you will be able to

1. Structure and style the content of your two page CV and one page r√©sum√© appropriately^[I use the terms *r√©sum√©* and *CV* interchangebly, with the only difference being their length, see section \@ref(length)]
1. Articulate your story^[actually a collection of short stories] by providing convincing evidence of your `experience`, `projects` and `education` etc
1. Identify and fix bugs in CV‚Äôs by:
    + Their `content` (what you've done and who you are) and `presentation` (how you style your CV)
    + Constructively criticising other people's CVs
    + Asking for, listening to, and acting on constructive criticism of your own CV
1. Quantify and provide convincing evidence for any claims you make you on your CV
1. Identify gaps (mostly `content` bugs) in your own CV and how you might begin to fill them


## Beware of the black hole {#blackhole}  
Before we get started, let's consider some advice from software engineer [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell). Gayle is an experienced software engineer who has worked at some of the [biggest technology employers in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech): Apple, Microsoft and Google. She has also authored a cracking series of books on technology careers, particularly *[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_the_Coding_Interview)* [@cracking] which we'll discuss in chapter \@ref(speaking). Gayle refers to the employer ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù described in figure \@ref(fig:gayle-fig).

```{r gayle-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongayle)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gayle-black-hole.jpeg")
```
(ref:captiongayle) Beware of what software engineer [Gayle Laakmaan McDowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell) calls the employer ‚ÄúBlack Hole‚Äù, especially if you're applying to large employers. ‚ÄúGetting through the doors, unfortunately, seems insurmountable. Hoards of candidates submit r√©sum√©s each year, with only a small fraction getting an interview. The online application system ‚Äì or, as it‚Äôs more appropriately nicknamed, *The Black Hole*, ‚Äì is littered with so many r√©sum√©s that even a top candidate would struggle to stand out.‚Äù [@blackhole; @techcareer] Laakmann portrait by Gayle Laakmaan is licensed CC BY 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/wiu](https://w.wiki/wiu) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238) Thank you Gayle for permission to use your photo. üë©‚Äçüíª

If you're applying to big employers, you'll need to create a CV that is good enough to stand out before it disappears over the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon) and into an employers black hole, see section \@ref(rejection). Employer practices vary, but according to some estimates the person reading your CV will typically:

* Spend around **7 seconds** (or less!) deciding if your CV is interesting enough to shortlist and read in a bit more depth. This is a pessimistic view, see the discussion by Andrew Fennell for a more complete story [@fennell]
* Shortlist about **20%** of the all CVs they get sent [@fennell]
* Interview about **2%** of the candidates on their shortlist [@fennell]

So, the *first* thing your CV or r√©sum√© needs to do is:

* catch attention so it ends up in the *lets read that a bit more pile*. 

Having passed the 7 second test, the second thing your CV or r√©sum√© needs to do is:

* *persuade an employer to invite you to an interview*. 

You can start with an employer-agnostic CV but you may need to come back and revisit the issues in this chapter once you have identified some target employers, so that you can customise and tailor your CV and written applications.

## The CV is dead, long live the CV! {#dead}  
R√©sum√©s and CV's have reigned supreme in the kingdom of employment and recruitment for many years but their demise has often been predicted, see figure \@ref(fig:longlive-fig).

```{r longlive-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionlonglive)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/the-king-is-dead.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionlonglive) The seemingly contradictory phrase [the king is dead, long live the king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_king_is_dead,_long_live_the_king!) simultaneously announces the death of the previous monarch and the accession of a new one. Likewise, the death of the [CV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae) (and [r√©sum√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9)) has long been hailed but it keeps coming back to reign again. The CV is dead, long live the CV! The r√©sum√© is dead, long live the r√©sum√©!

While it is true that some employers don't accept CVs or favour online application forms or digital profiles, it is still worth writing a CV because:

* Your CV provides a record for you of relevant things you've done
* Your CV enables you to get your story straight, *What's your story, coding glory?* see section \@ref(story) [@whatsthestory]
* Your CV forces you to articulate who you are and what you want, see chapter \@ref(exploring)
* Some employers will still ask you for one, see section \@ref(robotproof) and figure \@ref(fig:longlive-fig)
* Your CV helps you script and practice your ‚Äúlines‚Äù for interviews, see chapter \@ref(speaking)

Even if an employer never asks you for your CV, you'll frequently want to use the *content* of your CV in applications and interviews. So this chapter looks at how you can debug your written applications, whatever the mechanism is for submitting them.

You can of course *augment* your CV with various public digital profiles such as LinkedIn, Github etc. A public digital profile can help employers find you, see section \@ref(portfolio).

*Wherever* you're putting information about yourself for potential employers, on a CV, R√©sum√©, LinkedIn profile the same principles apply. See the checklist in section \@ref(checklist) and for specific advice on LinkedIn see:

* [linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students](https://linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students)

## It's not a bug, it's a feature! {#trope}

An age old trope in Computer Science that engineers use to pass off their mistakes as deliberate features is the bug/feature distinction, see figure \@ref(fig:notabug-fig).

```{r notabug-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionnotabug)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/notabug.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionnotabug)  ‚ÄúIt's not a *bug*, it's a *feature*...‚Äù (according to A. Hacker). Do you have [software bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) or [undocumented features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undocumented_feature) on your CV or r√©sum√©? Although tolerated in software, bugs in your CV, r√©sum√© and written applications can be fatal. Picture of gold-dust weevil *[Hypomeces pulviger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomeces_pulviger)* by [Basile Morin](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Basile_Morin) is licensed CC BY SA via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3E62](https://w.wiki/3E62) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Nobody likes buggy software, but unfortunately we routinely have to tolerate badly-designed, low quality, bug-ridden software in our everyday lives. [@badsoftware; @failware]

In contrast, buggy CVs are rarely tolerated, they will usually end up in the bin. Even a tiny defect, like an innocent typo, can be ~~fetal~~ fatal. [@typos] Most employers (particularly large and well known ones) have to triage hundreds or even thousands of CV's for any given vacancy. This means the person reading your CV is as likely to be looking for reasons to `REJECT` your CV, than `ACCEPT` it, because that's a sensible strategy for shortlisting from a huge pool of candidates. A buggy CV, application and covering letter could ruin your chances of being invited to an interview, see chapter \@ref(speaking).

<!-- false positives and false negatives-->

<!--see e.g. https://community.rstudio.com/t/appending-a-pre-existing-pdf-to-a-new-created-by-r-markdown/45641

```{r cv-fig, fig.align="center", fig.cap="this is a caption", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rick-urshion.pdf")
```

doesn't work for some unknown reason


```{r marissa-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "this is a sample CV"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/marissa.png")
```
-->

Like writing software, the challenging part of writing a CV isn't the *creation* but in the *debugging* and subsequent re-writing. Can you identify and fix the bugs before they are fatal?

<!--## Debug their CV {#bugfeature} It's difficult to be objective about your own CV.-->

::: {.rmdcaution}

(ref:codingcaution)

If you ask three people what they think of your CV, you will get three different and probably contradictory opinions. CV's are very subjective and very personal. The advice in this chapter is based on common sense, experience and ongoing conversations with employers. What makes a good CV will depend on the personal preferences and prejudices of your readers. So, this chapter just describes some general debugging guidelines, rather than rigid rules.

It is good practice to *triangulate* responses from your readers. For example, if three different people point out the same bug in your CV you can be confident that it is a bug that needs fixing.

:::

While referring to this guide, remember that:

* The main purpose of your CV is to get an interview, not a job. Your CV should catch attention and provide talking points for an interview
* Your CV will be assessed in seconds, rather than minutes so brevity really is key
* Bullet points with verbs first (see section \@ref(verbsfirst)) will:
  + allow your reader to quickly skim your CV because [employers don't actually read CVs](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/how-people-read/) [@scanning]
  + highlight your key activities
  + avoid long sections of flowery [prose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose) which the reader will very probably skip anyway. Instead, you can use your beautiful prose on your covering letters or personal statements, see section \@ref(we3qs)

You're not trying to tell your *whole* life story from section \@ref(story) but to distill the essentials into several short stories which can be summarised into a handful of bullets or sentences. Your CV should be punchy like the [blurb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurb) or synopsis on the back of a novel, can you entice the reader into wanting to find out more (by inviting you to an interview)?

## Write something, anything! {#mycv}

Just as you can't edit a blank page, you can't debug an unwritten CV either, see figure \@ref(fig:jodi-picoult-fig). Debugging and editing your CV can be time consuming but wherever criticism of your CV or r√©sum√© comes from, don't take it personally - it is probably one of the first you have written.

```{r jodi-picoult-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongarbage)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/jodi-picoult.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiongarbage)  ‚Äú*If it's writing time, I write. I may write garbage, but you can always edit garbage. You can't edit a blank page*‚Äù --Jodi Picoult [@picoult] I often speak to students who tell me their CV isn't ready yet. Just as you can't edit a blank page, you can't debug an unwritten (or unseen) CV either. So write something, *anything*. Even if you *think* its garbage you won't be able to improve it until you've written it. You can't start a fire without a spark. [@springsteen1; @springsteen2] Likewise, if you're doing a CV swap <!--needs link to pic--> - go easy when giving feedback to its author, you'll often be treading on delicate and personal ground. Public domain portrait of novelist [Jodi Picoult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodi_Picoult) by Lauren Gerson via the U.S. National Archives on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/6i4E](https://w.wiki/6i4E) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)


It might help to think of first version of your CV as an [alpha or beta version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle) that you continuously test, release and redeploy. If it was an iPhone, its a [first generation iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)) - with many future iterations to come! There are many chances to debug and improve your CV during your study but before potential employers read it. The aim of this chapter is to help you improve your CV, whatever stage you are at. Employers often grumble about Computer Science graduates lacking good written communication skills. Written applications and CV's are a common example of this. Here are some common bugs (or are they features?) to pay attention to on initial draughts of your CV:

<!-- this repeats the checklist at the end and needs moving-->
1. **EDUCATION**: Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) degree classification clear? Have you mentioned things you are studying now, not just courses you have finished? See section \@ref(mycved)
1. **STRUCTURE**: Is the structure sensible? Is it in reverse chronological order? Most important (usually recent) things first? Not too many sections or anything missing? See section \@ref(mycvst)
1. **NUMBERS**: Have you *quantified* the context, action, results and evidence of the short stories on your CV where possible? See (`C.A.R.E.`) in section \@ref(care)
1. **VERBS FIRST**: Have you talked about what you have actually done using prominent `verbs`, rather than just what you think you know? Avoid long sections of [prose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose), see section \@ref(verbsfirst)
1. **STYLE**: Does it look good, with a decent layout with appropriate use of [LaTeX](https://latex4year1.netlify.app/) or Word or whatever? [@latex4year1] Are there any spelling mistakes, typos and grammar? Don't just rely on a spellchecker, some errors will only be ~~spitted~~ spotted by a human reader see section \@ref(spelling)
1. **LENGTH**: Does it fit comfortably on (ideally) one page (for a R√©sum√©) or two pages (for a CV)? See section \@ref(length)
1. **SEE ALSO**: This is just a quick checklist to get you started, see the longer CV checklist in section \@ref(checklist)

## Structure your CV and R√©sum√© {#mycvst}

How you structure your CV and R√©sum√© will depend on who you are and what your story is. Recruiters at Google suggest you have four or five sections, that follow a header section. Before we zoom in on those, let's look at some broader points about CVs and R√©sum√©s. Start by watching the short video shown in figure \@ref(fig:lopez-vid).

```{r lopez-vid, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongooglerecruiters)"}
knitr::include_url('https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYUy1yvjHxE')
```

(ref:captiongooglerecruiters) Recruiters at Google, [Jeremy Ong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-ong/) and [Lizi Lopez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizilopez/) outline some tips and advice for creating your r√©sum√©. You can also watch the 8 minute video embedded in this figure at [youtu.be/BYUy1yvjHxE](https://youtu.be/BYUy1yvjHxE). [@youtube-google-recruiters]

<!-- this doesn't really fit here in structure, is there somewhere better? -->
As Jonathan Black, director of the careers service at the University of Oxford points out in figure \@ref(fig:black-vid), there are three key things you want to demonstrate in your CV:

1. that you can take responsibility
1. that you achieve things
1. that you are good company (or at least a valued team member)

How will you demonstrate and provide evidence each of these traits? 

<!--Remember that no applicant meets all the criteria, so 80% means you're doing really well [@topnotchcv]-->
```{r black-vid, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionjonathanblack)"}
knitr::include_url('https://www.youtube.com/embed/yjdvCHWVtE4')
```

(ref:captionjonathanblack) [Jonathan Black](https://twitter.com/jonathanpblack), head of the careers service at the University of Oxford,  explains how to create a top notch CV by replacing meaningless assertions with meaningful evidence. You can also watch the 11 minute video embedded in this figure at [youtu.be/yjdvCHWVtE4](https://youtu.be/yjdvCHWVtE4). [@topnotchcv]

<!-- if moving this to a new section move reference from big bad buglist to mycvst -->
Quantifying and providing evidence for any claims you make will create a much more convincing CV. Numbers can transform meaningless assertions described in figure \@ref(fig:black-vid) into meaningful evidence. So for example:

```md
* Achieved excellent results
```

...is a bit vague, what were the results exactly, can you measure them somehow? Or at least describe them?

```md
* Worked in a team
```

So you worked in a team? `Worked` is vague. What was your role and contribution exactly? How long did the project last? How many people were on your team?  What were the results of your actions? What's the story, coding glory? [@whatsthestory]

### Your header {#mycvpd}

The first thing in your CV is the header, a simple section giving your name, email, phone number and any links shown in the CV in figure \@ref(fig:turinghead-fig) for Alan Turing. That's it!

```{r turinghead-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captioncvheader)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/alan-turing-header.png")
```

(ref:captioncvheader) Keep the header of your CV simple like Alan's example here. Just your name, email, phone number and any relevant links (e.g. [enwp.org/Alan_Turing](https://enwp.org/Alan_Turing) here) are all you really need. You might also include a timestamp like `last updated 1954-06-07` and if you have a public digital profile, your header is a good place to put it, see section \@ref(portfolio). Any additional information risks wasting valuable space and distracting your reader. [Less is more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_(Unix)).

Your header doesn't need to include any more information than your name, email, phone and any links. This means your birth date, marital status, photo^[different countries have different conventions when it comes to passport-style photos on a CV. In the UK what you look like should *not* be a factor in an employers decision to interview you, so leave it out] and home address aren't relevant. You don't need to give multiple phone numbers or emails either, just one of each will do. If an employer wants to invite you to an interview, they'll get in touch by email, phone (or possibly LinkedIn, github etc) so other contact details such as your postal address are an irrelevant distraction at this point. After your header I suggest you have about five sections that cover some or all of the following:

1. üéì `Education`: the formal stuff, see section \@ref(mycved)
1. üí∞ `Experience`: paid work, see section \@ref(mycvex)
1. üí™ `Projects`: personal, school, social, side or University projects see section \@ref(mycvpj)
1. üèÜ `Leadership and awards`: your trophy cabinet, see section \@ref(prizes)
1. ‚ùì `Optional`: but don't call it that, see section \@ref(misc)

Let's look at each of these sections in turn:  

### Your education, education, education {#mycved}

Unless you have a *significant* amount of experience, the `Education` section of your CV should be the first ‚Äúreal‚Äù section, after the header. Your education section is important, see figure \@ref(fig:blair-fig) so your description of it needs to strike a balance between:

* Describing in enough detail what you've studied and any projects^[If you put these in a `projects` section all of their own (see section \@ref(mycvpj)), make sure you clearly distinguish between extra-curricular projects you've done outside of your formal education vs compulsory projects you've *had* to do as part of your degree] you've completed at University as part of your *formal* education
* Keeping it short and sweet by avoiding getting bogged down in tedious and irrelevant educational details that will be of little interest to your readers

```{r blair-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionblair)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tony-blair-education-education-education.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionblair) [Tony Blair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair)'s top three priorities as a new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom were `education, education and education`. [@tonyblair; @blair] Likewise, at this stage of your career, your education should be a top priority on your CV. Education should go first, unless you've got a *significant* amount of `experience`. As a graduate (or undergraduate) your education is the most recent, relevant and important thing about you so it should have top billing, see the discussion in figure \@ref(fig:lopez-vid). This [GNU Free Documentation Licensed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License) (GFDL) portrait of Tony Blair in 2007 by the Polish Presidency on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/64Kd](https://w.wiki/64Kd) has been adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

You've invested a significant amount of time and money in getting your degree. At this stage, your degree justifies a longer description than a rather terse one line `BSc Computer Science`. You'll need to:

* say *more* than [Pen Tester](Penelope_Tester.pdf) and [Rick Urshion](Rick_Urshion.pdf), who haven't said enough about their University education
* say *less* than [Mike Rokernel](Mike_Rokernel.pdf), who has given *way* too much information on his degree.

You don't need to name every single module, course code with a mark for each. Neither do you need to give your result to FOUR or FIVE significant figures: `71.587%`^[Do you *really* think academic performance can be measured that precisely?]. Two significant figures will do just fine: `72% (first class)`. You might like to pick out relevant modules, or the ones you enjoyed most. Employers like Google encourage applicants to emphasise courses on data structures and algorithms, but you'll need to tailor your description to the role and be brief. On a one page R√©sum√©, you'll probably only have two or three lines to summarise some of the modules you've studied at University. üéì

### Your experience {#mycvex}  

Experience is where you can talk about any paid or voluntary work experience you have. For paid work call it `EXPERIENCE` rather than `WORK EXPERIENCE` as the latter can imply work *shadowing*, see section \@ref(areuexperienced). Work shadowing is valuable, but paid work is even better so you should make it clear if your experience was paid or not. Don't discount the value of casual labour, such as working in retail or hospitality, these demonstrate your work ethic and ability to deal with customers, often under pressure. You are more than just a techie too, so anywhere you've worked in a team is experience worth mentioning, even if that team was just two people. Two people is still a team.

```{r done-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionwhathaveudone)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/What have you done.png")
```

(ref:captionwhathaveudone) Are you experienced? What have you done outside of your formal academic education? Employers will want to know *much more* about you than just your `Education`. Are you `Experienced`? What `Projects` have you done? Can you demonstrate `Leadership`? Have you won any `Awards`? Experience sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) With apologies to [Jimi Hendrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix). [@hendrix]

If you don't have much experience, don't worry, there are plenty of opportunities to get some more  . For details, see chapter \@ref(experiencing) *experiencing your future*.

Are you experienced? Whatever it is, make sure you add it to your `experience` section. üí∞

### Your projects {#mycvpj}

The `Projects` section of your CV is where you can describe all your other activities. Your projects will include activities that you haven't already described in your `Education` or your paid `Experience` section such as:

* personal side projects, see section \@ref(tinkering)
* social responsibility projects, not neccesarily technical, see section \@ref(volunteering)
* open source projects, see section \@ref(opensource)
* entrepreneurial projects, your ‚Äú[side hustles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_job)‚Äù (if you have any)
* hackathons, olympiads and other competitive or collaborative events, see section \@ref(tinkering)
* University projects:
    + these sometimes fit better in your `Education` section, depending on how many non-Uni projects you have
    + If you are publishing a group project, you will need permission from *all* of your team to make the code public 
    + Be *careful* publishing coursework. If someone copies your coursework, you will **BOTH** be guilty of academic malpractice because you've colluded in plagiarism.
    + ... but final year (‚Äú[capstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capstone_course)‚Äù) projects are great as these will tend to be unique, distinguishing you from everybody else in your year group

Your projects will most likely be unpaid because paid work tends to fit better under the heading `experience`, see section \@ref(mycvex). Perhaps you've completed some courses outside of your education such as a massive open online course  (MOOC) or similar. Hackathons and competitions, fit well here too. [@hafb] You don't *need* to have won any prizes or awards, although be sure to mention them if you have. Participating in hackathons and competitions clearly shows the reader that you enjoy learning new things. Demonstrating an appetite for new knowledge and skills will make your application stand out. If you're looking for some inspiration for side projects, the [codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) repository is a good starting point. Building and creating new things is a great way to understand them, just ask [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) shown in figure \@ref(fig:feynman-fig). What you cannot create you do not understand. Another great way to learn is to get involved with open source projects which we describe in section \@ref(opensource).

Any longer projects you've done at University are worth mentioning. Your projects are important because they differentiate you from everyone else in your year group. Try to be *more* descriptive than this:

```md
* First year team project
```
or perhaps
```md
* Second year team project
```
or even just
```md
* Final year project
```

By themselves, those project names are pretty opaque. They are OK for giving the *context* of your story but don't tell the reader anything about what *you* did or what the *software/hardware/project* did. What was the story (the context, action, result and evidence (`CARE`) we described in section \@ref(care)) of those projects? How many people were in your team? How long did you collaborate for? What did you build? What was it called? What did it do? What roles and responsibilities did you have in the team? Was their conflict in the team? How did you resolve it? How did you motivate the free-riders in the team to contribute? This is all excellent CV [fodder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fodder), see \@ref(fig:cvfodder-fig)


```{r cvfodder-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfodder)"}

```
(ref:captionfodder) Have you ever had a project that didn't go very well? Did it all go [pear-shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pear-shaped)? [@piriform] Perhaps you managed to turn the project around? Maybe you learned some lessons from those painful mistakes you won't be repeating? Difficult projects can make great stories (aka CV [fodder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fodder)) because mistakes *can* be good, see section \@ref(estherdyson), as long as you don't repeat them.

It's often better to describe what YOU did before you describe what the software, hardware or project did. Your reader is much more likely to be interested in the former than the latter. Let's imagine you've developed a piece of software called `WidgetWasher`. You might describe it like this:

````md
* WidgetWasher is a web service that washes widgets
* It uses an HTTP API and secret keys
* Tested WidgetWasher on a range of different operating systems
* Collaborated with one other contributor over two days
* Designed and implemented an API
````


Instead, you could reverse ‚Üë‚Üì the order to change the emphasis like this:

````md
* Designed and implemented an API ‚Üë
* Collaborated with one other contributor over two days ‚Üë
* Tested WidgetWasher on a range of different operating systems
* Utilised an HTTP API and secret keys ‚Üì
* Created a web service that washes widgets called WidgetWasher ‚Üì
````

The latter has all the same information, but by reversing the order, you've emphasised what *you* did, rather than what the software did. Much more interesting. üí™
<!-- need a section on üëë Activities and leadership -->

### Your leadership & awards {#prizes}
If you can demonstrate leadership, you may want to dedicate a whole separate section to it. Experience of tutoring or mentoring other students, can serve as a good example through peer-assisted study schemes (like [PASS](https://www.peersupport.manchester.ac.uk/what-is-peer-support/what-is-pass/)) for example. Teaching is a different kind of leadership to running a small business or captaining a sports team, but it is leadership nonetheless. A `leadership` and/or `awards` section is also a good place to add any prizes you've won, see figure \@ref(fig:trophy-fig)

```{r trophy-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiontrophy)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/trophy.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiontrophy) Have you won any prizes or trophies? If you have, make sure you describe *what* your prizes were awarded for and any ranking associated with them, as discussed in the text below. You're not just blowing your own trumpet, but clearly demonstrating to your reader that  *somebody else* (besides yourself) recognised and rewarded your achievements. [CC0 public domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en) picture of [Johan Cruyff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff) holding the [European Champion Clubs' Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Champion_Clubs%27_Cup) in 1972 from the [Nationaal Archief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationaal_Archief) on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/6h5t](https://w.wiki/6h5t) adapted using the [Wikipedia App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238) ‚öΩÔ∏è


If you've been granted any interesting awards or honours be sure to mention them, because they provide evidence to the reader that a third party has endorsed you. *Other* people think you are good at something, and this says much more than *you* thinking you're good at something. You'll typically need a bit more than this:

```md
* Awarded the Poppleton University scholarship for excellence
```

Congratulations, but how many people were awarded that prize? How many applicants or entrants were there and what percentage were successful? Was it a regional, national or global award? How frequently is the award given? It is unlikely that your reader will have heard of the award unless it is widely known. You might talk about your ranking e.g.

```md
* Won third prize in the flibbertigibbet competition
```

Again, congratulations, but third place out of how many?

* `3/3`? Not so impressive
* `3/30`?
* `3/300`?
* `3/3000`? More impressive

 Numbers can speak louder than words, so if you're going to mention awards, quantify^[an approximation will do if you don't have exact figures] where you can so the reader can understand what the prize was for. You may well be intimately acquainted with the [flibbertigibbet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flibbertigibbet) competition but your reader probably won't of heard of it, so give some context. 
 
 Finally, your `awards` section might also include any courses you've done *outside* of the formal (compulsory) and university courses described in your `Education` section^[External courses demonstrate your learning interests beyond just ticking the boxes of what your University requires of you for your formal education]. Extra skills and knowledge you've picked up from [Massive Open Online Courses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) (MOOCs) or any other credentials you've collected such as those described in sections \@ref(mooc) and \@ref(otherbadges), are worth mentioning. üèÜ

### Your optional extras {#misc}
If you have anything else you want to highlight besides your `Education`, `Experience`, `Projects`, `Leadership and Awards` you *may* still have room for one more optional section. Try to come up with a better names for this section than: 

* `Miscellaneous`
* `Extracurricular` 
* `Other highlights and activities`

These titles sound like dumping grounds for your leftovers. You might decide to have a dedicated `skills` or `personal statement` section but see section \@ref(mycvsk) and \@ref(bullshit).

You could opt to have a `hobbies and interests` section which can add a bit of colour to what can otherwise become quite a dull list of facts. However, it is debatable how many (if any) hobbies and interests you should list on your CV. For a one-pager you're usually pushed for space and looking for things to edit *out* (rather than add in), so if you're going to list hobbies, I'd stick to those that are relevant to the job or those that demonstrate particular transferrable or soft skills. Organising or participating in team sports is a good example of a relevant hobby as it provides evidence of your teamwork, commitment, reliability etc, see figure \@ref(fig:quidditch-fig). Other collaborative activities outside of sport will also demonstrate your communication skills. [@hobbies]

```{r quidditch-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionquidditch)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Anyone for quidditch.png")
```
(ref:captionquidditch) It is debatable which, if any, of your hobbies should go on your CV. You might get lucky and your interviewer(s) will share your esoteric passion for [Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(real-life_sport)) (say). [@quidditch] However, such coincidences are unlikely so if you *do* list your hobbies and interests, think carefully about *WHY* you are mentioning them and *WHAT* skills, knowledge or experience you are trying to demonstrate to potential employers. [Anyone for Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyone_for_tennis%3F) sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

The fact that you enjoy `swimming`, `reading`, `football`, `cooking` and `hiking` is vague and pretty boring, making it unlikely to be a factor in the decision to invite you to interview. There's nothing *wrong* with these pastimes but there's not much point mentioning them on your CV unless you have, for example:

* coached a swimming team
* trained as a mountain leader
* organised, hosted and participated in a book club
* won some awards for your hobby, like a [black belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_belt_(martial_arts)) or chess championship for example
* regularly participated in or organised competitive sports matches (for example)

In this case, the *way* you have engaged with your hobbies demonstrates your communication and leadership skills. So in this context, your hobbies *are* worth talking about if you have any space left. However, if they are just hobbies that enable you to amuse yourself, you should probably leave them out as they are unlikely to be of interest to an employer. Sure, they add colour to your CV, but you've probably got more interesting and important things to say about who you are.

Of course, you *might* get lucky and your interviewer(s) could be intrigued by (or even share) your esoteric passion for [Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(real-life_sport)) (say), but you can't rely on it. So, I reckon if you're going to mention hobbies and interests at all then ...

* pick the unusual hobbies that make you unique
* describe the interests that add some colour and personality to your CV
* be specific, e.g. `reading japanese novels from 20th century` might sound more interesting (and convincing) than just `reading`
* highlight any `actions` you've taken, see chapter \@ref(actioning)

... or just leave them out altogether. That option is up to you.‚ùì

### Show your C.A.R.E. {#mycvsk}

You may be tempted to dedicate a whole section on your CV to `skills`, particularly the technical ones. Maybe it makes you feel good listing them all in one place like a stamp collection. If you're going to have a `skills` section, keep it short. Why? Let's imagine, that like [Rick Urshion](Rick_Urshion.pdf), you include Python in a long list of skills, with its own dedicated section. There are at least five problems with Rick's not so skilful approach:

1. ‚ùé **No `Context`** to give the reader an idea of where he's developed or used his Python skills. Was it during his education, as a part of his work experience or his personal projects? We don't know because he doesn't say.  
1. ‚ùé **No `Actions`** to demonstrate what he's *done* with his Python skills. So Rick claims he knows Python. So what? What did he use them for? We don't know because he hasn't told us.
1. ‚ùé **No `Results`** given for what the outcome of using the skills was. Did he save his employers some money? Did he make something more efficient? Did he learn some methodology? We will never know.  
1. ‚ùé **No `Evidence`** to support his claims. Perhaps he DOES have Python skills, perhaps he DOESN'T. Is he telling lies and peddling fake news (see section \@ref(oversell))? It's difficult to tell.
1. ‚ùé **No `C.A.R.E.`**  There's no story told for that skill, see figure \@ref(fig:gallagher-fig). This makes for a very dull and boring read. Yawn. NEXT! ü•±

```{r gallagher-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongallagher)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/whats-the-story.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiongallagher) So *[(What's your Story) ~~Morning~~ Coding Glory?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(What%27s_the_Story)_Morning_Glory%3F)* [@whatsthestory] What is the `Context`, the `Actions`, the `Results` and the `Evidence` for the stories that you are trying to tell? Show your `C.A.R.E.` in storytelling. CC BY portrait of [Noel Gallagher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Gallagher) by [alterna2.com](https://alterna2.com/) on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3bimy](https://w.wiki/3bim) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238) üé∏

So, this doesn't mean Rick shouldn't mention his Python skills. Where he can, he needs to give us the `C`ontext, `A`ction, `R`esult and `E`vidence (`C.A.R.E.`) of his story described in section \@ref(care). This will make his Python story much more convincing and interesting to read. Showing a bit of `C.A.R.E.` will improve his chances of being invited to interview.

This applies to soft skills too, not just hard technical skills. It is often better to mention the context in which you've used the skills you mention on your CV. So, if you're going to have a skills section:

* keep it short, no more than two or three lines on a one-page CV
* stick to your strongest and most relevant skills that you are comfortable to answer questions on in your interview, rather than an exhaustive encyclop√¶dic inventory
* avoid vague metrics of skill like `beginner`, `intermediate` and `advanced` as these are very subjective and won't help the reader much. You might under or over-estimate your skill level anyway. Some people choose to quantify coding skills with `years of experience` or the `lines of code` (LoC), but these still don't tell the reader very much. [@linesofcode] 
* avoid listing mass marketed office products of Microsoft (e.g. Word etc) as a skill, they are *not* generally very interesting skill because almost *everyone* has them. They won't set you apart much from your competition, so don't waste valuable space talking about office applications unless you've done something interesting with them, like some advanced integration with other software. Cloud services can be a slightly different matter, see section \@ref(techie).

If you're a computer scientist, you also have demonstrable `meta` skills like the ability to learn things quickly. You can also think logically and critically, reason, problem solve, analyse, generalise, decompose and abstract - often to tight deadlines. These [computational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking) skills are future-proof and will last longer than whatever technology happens to be fashionable right now. Employers are often more interested in these `meta` capabilities and your potential than in any specific technical skills you may or may not have.

## Bird's eye view
Having zoomed in on the details of sections you're likely to have, we'll zoom back out to take a [bird's eye view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird%27s-eye_view) of your whole CV. The issues in this section apply to the whole of your CV, rather than individual sections.

### Your style {#style}

Making your CV look good can take ages, but a well presented CV will stand out. While its worth making an effort to style carefully and consistently, you need to be be wary of the huge time sink of [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography).

```{r cvwork-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionworkcv)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/CV need a little work.png")
```
(ref:captionworkcv) Does your CV need a little work? The truth is your CV is never finished, you will be continuously developing, debugging and releasing it throughout your life. It's such a crucial document because it will determine if you are invited to interview. Any time you spend getting it right is a good investment. CV work sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Seemingly trivial typographical details can make a big difference to the overall look and feel of your document. The [devil is in the details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_devil_is_in_the_details), for example the repeated text [the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog) in a bulleted list doesn't use a proper indent...

‚Ä¢ `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`

... whereas the same text below *does* use a proper indented bullet. The latter looks more professional and is easier to read, especially when you have multiple bullet points:

* `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`

### Porting your future {#pdf}

Whatever your typographical style is, portable document format (`*.pdf`) is the safest way to deliver it. It's called *portable* for a reason. While Microsoft Word is fine for editing, it is difficult to ensure that a Word document doesn't get mangled by transmission via the web, email or even Microsoft's own products like Teams! PDF is much safer, you can be more confident that it will work well on a range of different operating systems and devices. Try opening a Word document on a range of different smartphones and tablets and you'll see what I mean. It helps your reader if you can give your CV file a descriptive name, especially if it is being read by a human and not a robot. ü§ñ

* ‚ùå `cv.pdf` (not a very descriptive filename)
* ‚úÖ `ada_lovelace.pdf`(a descriptive filname)
* ‚ùå `cv-version1-final-FINAL-version-USE-THIS-ONE.pdf` (reveals more about you than you might want to!)
* ‚úÖ `alan_turing.pdf`(a descriptive filname)
* ‚ùå `one-page-version.pdf` (unhelpful)


It's fine to author your CV in Microsoft Word, but you'll want to save it as (or print to) PDF to make it more platform independent. LaTeX and [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.comr) can be used to create professional PDFs and there are plenty of good templates. See [Getting started with LaTeX (LaTeX4year1)](https://latex4year1.netlify.app/) if you've not used LaTeX before, or you need to refresh your memory. [@latex4year1]

### What's your story, coding glory? {#care}

One way to structure descriptions of items within each section of your CV is to use **C**ontext, **A**ction, **R**esult and **E**vidence (C.A.R.E.) to tell your stories. What's your story, coding glory? [@whatsthestory] The `C.A.R.E.` method can also be useful for structuring answers to interview questions, especially if you get nervous. So for example, rather than just listing `Python` as a skill, you could tell the reader more about the context in which you've used python, what you actually did with it and what the result was. You really need to spell it out.

* **CONTEXT**: So you've used `Python`, but in what context? As part of your education? For a personal project? As a volunteer? In a competition? All of the above?
* **ACTION**:  What did you *do* with `Python`? Did you use some particular library? Did you integrate or model something? What verbs can you use to describe these actions, see chapter \@ref(actioning)
* **RESULT**: What was the result and how can you measure it? You picked up some new skills? What was the impact? Perhaps you made something that was inefficient and awkward into something better, cheaper or faster? Some things are hard to measure but you should quantify results where you can.
* **EVIDENCE**: Where evidence exists, you should highlight it. That could be a quantification, for example describing a result in numbers (see `as measured by` below) or it might be certification described in chapter \@ref(achieving). If you're talking about software, point to a copy online if you can, see section \@ref(portfolio). Nothing says ‚ÄúI can build software ...‚Äù quite like ‚Äú ... and here's one I made earlier‚Äù.

You don't have to stick rigidly to the order C.A.R.E. as long as they appear somewhere. For example, recruiters at Google (see figure \@ref(fig:lopez-vid)) advise candidates to describe their experience and projects using this simple pattern:

````md
* Accomplished [X], as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]
````

Where *accomplished* is `Result`, *measured by* is `Evidence` and *doing* is the `Action`. So instead of just saying:

````md
* Generated reports for end users
````

You could say:

````md
* Generated daily reconciliation report for team by automating workflow of 8 different tasks
````

The latter is better because it is more specific, captures the result (`accomplishment`), by giving evidence (`8 different tasks`) and talks about the actions (the `doing` part). Choose the verbs you use carefully, see chapter \@ref(actioning) for examples.


### Your length {#length}
How long should your CV be? Many people start with a two page CV, which is a sensible starting point shown in figure \@ref(fig:oneortwopager-vid). It is also advisable to [create a one page R√©sum√©](https://www.cv-library.co.uk/career-advice/cv/how-long-cv-be/). [@howlong]


```{r oneortwopager-vid, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiononeortwopager)"}
knitr::include_url('https://www.youtube.com/embed/0abDOKHS5T0')
```

(ref:captiononeortwopager) How long should your CV be? Should you write a two page European style CV or an American style r√©sum√© (one pager)? You can also watch the  5 minute video embedded in this figure at [youtu.be/0abDOKHS5T0](https://youtu.be/0abDOKHS5T0). [@youtube-resume-or-cv]

At this stage in your career you *should* be able to fit everything on to one page. However, it can be challenging and time consuming squeezing it all on, see figure \@ref(fig:shorterletter-fig).

```{r shorterletter-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionshorterletter)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/shorterletter.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionshorterletter) I would have written a shorter ~~letter~~, ~~CV~~, R√©sum√© but I did not have the time. This quote (or meme) is frequently attributed to Blaise Pascale's  *[Lettres provinciales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettres_provinciales)* [@shorterletter]. Public domain image by Gallica on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3Uzn](https://w.wiki/3Uzn) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238) üá´üá∑

It takes more time to write less. Writing a one page r√©sum√© is a valuable exercise, because it forces you to distill and edit out any filler or fluff, which you sometimes find on two page undergraduate or graduate CVs. It is much better to have a strong one-page r√©sum√© than a weaker two-page CV that is padded out with filler to make up the space, as described in the video in figure \@ref(fig:oneortwopager-vid). Adding more features (pages and content) to your CV doesn't necessarily make it better. Sometimes adding more features to your CV will make it worse, as shown in figure \@ref(fig:morefeatures-fig).

```{r morefeatures-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmorefeatures)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/an-engineering-state-of-mind.png")
```

(ref:captionmorefeatures) If it ain't broke it doesn't have enough features yet. Adding more features to software doesn't necessarily make it better. Likewise, adding more pages and content to your CV or r√©sum√© won't always improve it. It's often better to be precise and concise, rather than bloated and potentially more buggy. [An engineering state of mind](https://bryanmmathers.com/an-engineering-state-of-mind/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/), with help from Dilbert cartoonist [Scott Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams)

If you're struggling to fit all the information onto a one page r√©sum√©, revisit each section and item carefully: 

* Is there anything you can cut? 
* Can you save a wasteful word here or a lazy line there? 
* Check for any spurious line breaks, like a line with just one or two words on it, because every pixel counts.

Your two page CV is still a good store of stuff you might want to add to customised one-page r√©sum√©s. If you find yourself cutting important stuff, you could list it somewhere else (like LinkedIn etc, see section \@ref(portfolio)) and link to it from your CV. 

### Verbs first: lead with your actions {#verbsfirst}

A simple but effective technique for emphasising what you have done, rather than just what you know, is to start the description of it with a verb. Employers don't just want to know what you know, but what you have actually done. So, for example, instead of saying e.g.

````md
* In my second year CS29328 software engineering module I used Java, Eclipse and JUnit to test and build an open source Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG)
````

you could say:

````md
* Built and tested a large open-source codebase using Eclipse, Ant, JUnit and Jenkins‚Äù
````

followed by:

````md
* Added and deployed new features to a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) in Java
````


The latter examples get to the point much quicker and avoid the problem of using `I, me, my...` too much which can sound self-centred and egotistical. Although your CV is all about you so it is natural to have a few personal pronouns in there, too many can look clumsy and give the wrong impression. Choose the verbs you use carefully, see chapter \@ref(actioning) for examples.

### Your links {#links}

Augmenting your CV with web links (hyperlinks) can add important context, results and evidence to your stories, without adding too many words or taking up valuable space. An example using LinkedIn is shown in figure \@ref(fig:lovelace-fig).

```{r lovelace-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionlovelace)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lovelace-linkedin.png")
```
(ref:captionlovelace) Adding links is a good way to augment your CV. If you're adding LinkedIn, make sure you [customise your public profile URL](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/topics/6042/6054/87), (the `.../in/handle`) to remove the default randomly generated alphanumeric string at the end, like the `038b37` example here. [@customlinkedin] You can also remove any ugly `http`, colons `::`, forward slashes  `//`, `www` and trailing `/` in URLs which are distracting noise. Just make sure links are clickable in the pdf, don't [404](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) if they are followed and work when printed on paper too. Neither do you need to waste valuable space telling people what the link is, like in the first example, the domain name already tells you that it is a LinkedIn profile.

Links can provide `Context`, (Action), `Result` and `Evidence` (see `C.A.R.E.` in section \@ref(care)) by quantifying and substantiating any claims that you make. Links demonstrate what you've done and which communities you've been a part of. For example, you might says things like:

```md
* Built a thing called example.com
```

This shows that the thing you built was substantial enough to have its own domain. It also says ‚ÄúI like building things. Look at this thing I built just for fun, its really cool‚Äù. Or you might say:

```md
* Elected as a representative for hacksoc.com
```

The link shows you were part of a community: ‚ÄúI was part a bigger thing... ‚Äù you might not have heard about but you can find out about here. You might also say:

```md
* Competed at hack-to-the-future.com part III
```

Reading between the lines: ‚ÄúI really enjoy learning from other people by going to hackathons and competitions‚Äù

... and so on. So links are crucial features of your CV and an interested reader *may* even follow them. Treat links with respect and they will support your goals and help your readers. Invest some time thinking about how you word the link text, and how they would be understood out of context. Make sure that:

* your hyperlinks are [readable and descriptive](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/links/) [@readable]  
* your hyperlinks are clickable in the PDF. Don't expect your reader to cut and paste (or even type) URLs, they are too busy. If they are clickable, people are much more likely to follow them
* your hyperlinks are paper-proof: links with opaque titles like  ‚Äú[My LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/duncanhull)‚Äù, ‚Äú[click here](https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere.html)‚Äù, and ‚Äú[My Projects on Github](https://github.com/dullhunk)‚Äù  won't work well on printed paper unless you explicitly spell the URL out like this: 
    + [linkedin.com/in/duncanhull](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/duncanhull) 
    + [github.com/dullhunk](https://github.com/dullhunk)

Some people still print CV's so it is worth making links work on paper as well as online, see [to print or not to print ‚Äî a CV, that is](https://bbc.in/3zXv6zr) [@printcv]

Besides LinkedIn you could include public profiles from [github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile), [devpost.com](https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021734632-Update-your-profile-and-username), [hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard) and [stackoverflow](https://medium.com/@rhamedy/contribution-debt-why-how-to-contribute-to-stack-overflow-a69d4bd50d0c), see section \@ref(portfolio) [@stackoverflow]. You can also link to personal projects, any articles you've published or your blog if you have one. Obviously, you need to be careful about what you link to and what employers can find out about you online. They *will* Google you. So keep it professional and, as we discussed in a section \@ref(signposts3), if you're not already, be wary of social media.

::: {.rmdnote}
(ref:codingcomment)

LinkedIn is much more than a tool for publishing your CV or r√©sum√© because it also allows you to:

* search and apply for jobs
* create a digital portfolio that is publicly available^[Obviously, you might want to be careful about what information you put out there!]
* connect with professionals, think social media for jobs

Chapter \@ref(finding) looks at job searching in more detail but for now just note the similarities and differences between LinkedIn, CVs and r√©sum√©s outlined in table \@ref(tab:linkedintable). Some of these differences also apply to other places online where you might augment your CV with extra information such as github, devpost and others mentioned in section \@ref(links) and \@ref(portfolio).

:::

So, LinkedIn can be a useful tool for job hunting but it's a different beast to traditional CV's, some of these differences are shown in table \@ref(tab:linkedintable)

```{r linkedintable, echo = FALSE}
linkedin_table <- tibble::tribble(
    ~ "LinkedIn"                        , ~ "CV or r√©sum√©",     
  "Dynamic document that you can constantly update"    , "Static document, providing a snapshot that can't be updated once you've  sent it",       
  "Generally speaking, no length limit"     , "(ref:lengthcell)",
  "Public or semi-public document, more like social media"    , "Private document, should only be seen by those employers you send it to (anti-social media if you like)",      
  "Only one profile, you can't easily transfer connections if you open more than one account"    , "You might create multiple CV's that emphasise different skills and knowledge, or have different lengths such as a one page r√©sum√© and two page CV",  
  "Generic, allows employers and recruiters to target you"    , "Specific, can be targeted to a given employer or vacancy",  
)
knitr::kable(linkedin_table, caption = "Comparison of LinkedIn with conventional CV's and r√©sum√©s. The two mediums have a lot in common but also provide different communication channels which can be complementary, e.g. you could include your LinkedIn profile on your CV to augment it.", booktabs = TRUE)
```

<!--this is a nasty hack to get references into table cells-->
(ref:lengthcell) Limited length, typically one or two pages (for a graduate), see section \@ref(length)


### Robot proofing your CV {#robotproof}

It's a good idea get feedback from as many different sources as you can on your CV. By *sources* I don't just mean humans, but also robots. Larger employers will use automated [Applicant Tracking Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) (ATS) to log and trace your application. These ‚Äúr√©sum√© robots‚Äù (if you like) are unlikely to have arms and legs like the one in figure \@ref(fig:machines-fig), but they *will* be looking for keywords and standard headings in your CV. [@airesume] You can get automated feedback from a range of different automated systems, though it is a good idea to remove any personal information like phone numbers and emails before using these free services. You might also want to check what the services privacy policy says about what they do with your personal data. R√©sum√© robots include:

* [careerset.com](https://careerset.com), a free service provided by a UK based company, careerset Ltd. If you're a manchester student login at [careerset.com/manchester](https://careerset.com/manchester)
<!--* [resume.io](https://resume.io), a free service provided by a Dutch company, Imkey BV not really CV checker-->
* [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co), a free service provided by an American company not really a CV checker
* [kickresume.com](https://www.kickresume.com/) AI-powered resume builder also does cover letters
* [google.com/search?q=resume+checker](https://www.google.com/search?q=resume+checker)
* [google.com/search?q=CV+checker](https://www.google.com/search?q=cv+checker)


```{r machines-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmachines)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/The-inevitable-rise-of-the-machines-1280x720.png")
```

(ref:captionmachines) Just like the [daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) in [Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who), r√©sum√© robots often struggle to get up the stairs. [@doctorwho] Although they typically don't have arms, legs (or even wheels) robots are likely to play an important role in decisions made about if you are worth interviewing, especially if you're applying to bigger companies. Make sure your CV is r√©sum√© robot friendly by getting feedback from a robot. [Machines](https://bryanmmathers.com/machines/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) ü§ñ

Besides providing feedback on the content of your CV, using these systems can help address issues such as the use of tables or layout which may cause problems for some systems. For example, some systems ignore the second column of a two-column CV because they can't parse the [PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript) reliably to identify columns. Some things to check with automated CV screens:

* Have you used standard headings for the sections? Non-standard sections maybe ignored or misunderstood
* Have you used appropriate verbs to describe your actions?
* Is your layout and design robot friendly? Sometimes tables and two column layouts can get horribly mangled, see [what happens to tables and columns in an applicant tracking system](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/resume-tables-columns-ats/) [@jobscan]

### Spellchecking {#spelling}
Bots, grammar checkers, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and spell checkers can help improve your written applications and CV. However, you can't rely on machines and their algorithms completely. The r√©sum√© robots described in section \@ref(robotproof) will just encode the biases and prejudices of whoever wrote their algorithms, see section \@ref(machines). Basic spellcheckers can't be relied on completely either, as shown in the poem below:

```

Eye halve a spelling checker
It came with my pea sea
It plainly marques four my revue
Miss steaks eye kin knot sea

Eye strike a key and type a word
And weight for it to say
Weather eye am wrong oar write
It shows me strait a weigh

As soon as a mist ache is maid
It nose bee fore two long
And eye can put the error rite
Its rare lea ever wrong

Eye have run this poem threw it
I am shore your pleased two no
Its letter perfect awl the weigh
My chequer told me sew

---Anon
```

While automation can help improve your writing, ultimately there is no substitute for people (you know: actual *humans*) reading your CV, and the more people that read it the better. This could be potential employers, your critical friends shown in figure \@ref(fig:wonderfuldarling-fig) or just reading it **out loud** to yourself described in section \@ref(dogfooding).

### Your references {#referees}

You might be tempted to put your referees details on your r√©sum√©. Don't bother because;

* references waste valuable space. You can say much more interesting things about yourself than who you referees are
* references aren't needed in the early stages of a job application anyway. Employers typically ask for your referees *much* later, when you've been offered or are about to be offered the job
* references disclose personal information. Do you really want to be giving personal details out to anyone that reads your CV? It could easily be misused.

It's not even worth saying `references available on request` - that just wastes space as well and is implied information on every CV anyway.

## Checklist: Big Bad Bugs {#checklist}

Like [Atul Gawande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atul_Gawande), I'm a believer in the power of simple checklists. [@checklist] So here is a quick checklist for debugging your CV before you send it off to an employer:

1. üî≤ Does it fit comfortably on exactly one page (r√©sum√©) or two pages (CV)? Definitely not one-and-a-half pages or more than two? See section \@ref(length) Does the style look good? Is it easy on the eye? Is there adequate whitespace, not too much (gappy) or too little (cramped)? See section \@ref(pdf)
1. üî≤ Have you used past tense consistently e.g. `developed` not `develop`, `collaborated` not `collaborate`
1. üî≤ Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) overall degree classification clear? See section \@ref(mycved)
1. üî≤ Have you eaten your own dogfood (woof), see section \@ref(dogfooding)? Is *everything* relevant? e.g. no swimming certificates from ten years ago?
1. üî≤ Have you spell-checked using both automatic and manual (proof-reading) techniques? See section \@ref(spelling).
1. üî≤ Have you got a second opinion from a ‚Äúr√©sum√© robot‚Äù? Is it robot proof? See section \@ref(robotproof) ü§ñ
1. üî≤ Have you shown you `C.A.R.E`? Are the `Contexts`, `Actions`, `Results` and `Evidence` described in section \@ref(mycvsk) clear? Have you added `context` using relevant hyperlinks that an interested reader can click on? See section \@ref(links)
1. üî≤ Is it in reverse chronological order with the most recent things **first**? Can your timeline be easily followed, with all dates clearly aligned for easy reading? See [Neil Pointer](https://www.cdyf.me/Neil_Pointer.pdf) as an example with a clear timeline using right-aligned dates.
1. üî≤ Have you avoided using too many personal pronouns? `I, me, my ...` everywhere? See section \@ref(verbsfirst)
1. üî≤ Have you made it clear what you have actually done using **prominent** `verbs`? See chapter \@ref(actioning)
1. üî≤ Have you given sufficient information on your education without going into too much detail? Have you mentioned courses you are studying now (*and* next semester)? See section \@ref(mycved)
1. üî≤ Have you **quantified** and evidenced the claims you have made where you can? See section \@ref(mycvst)
1. üî≤ Is it balanced, including both technical and non-technical (softer) skills? See section \@ref(casual)
1. üî≤ Does it have a good, clear structure? Not too many headings, around five sections for a one-pager see section \@ref(mycvpd)?
1. üî≤ Have you clearly distinguished between paid, unpaid and voluntary `experience`? Have you done the same for your `projects`, see section \@ref(mycvpj)? Have you included *all* of the relevant experience that you can fit on including casual work, see section \@ref(casual)?
1. üî≤ Has your CV been reviewed by other people? Do a CV swap with a critical friend (see figure \@ref(fig:wonderfuldarling-fig)) and score each others CV's using [this rubric](https://www.cdyf.me/CV-rubric.pdf). This is a bit like [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). According to [Linus's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) ‚Äúgiven enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow‚Äù [@Raymond1999] so the more people who give you feedback the better
1. üî≤ Have you reviewed other people's CV's? This will put you in the shoes of an employer or recruiter, thereby helping you to write a better CV yourself. See the examples in chapter \@ref(hacking). Who would *you* want to interview and why?

```{r wonderfuldarling-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionwonderfuldarling)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Critical Friend.png")
```

(ref:captionwonderfuldarling) Showing your CV to somebody else is one of the best ways to debug it. You need to find a [critical friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_friend), somebody who won't just tear it apart (`hostile witness`) or tell you it's simply *wonderful* darling (`uncritical lover`) but tell you how to improve it, whatever state it is in (`critical friend`).

## Covering letters & personal statements {#we3qs}
Applications and CV's are often accompanied by covering letters or include some kind of personal statement or summary. They are your [elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) shown in figure \@ref(fig:elevator-fig). Whereas a lot of your CV is essentially a bulleted list of facts, numbers and evidence, a covering letter or personal statement gives you a chance to *really* demonstrate your fluent written communication skills in clear [prose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose). If you're going to include a `personal statement` or `profile` on your CV keep it short, unlike [Mike Rokernel](https://www.cdyf.me/mike_rokernel.pdf) who waffles on for *ages* (yawn) without actually providing any evidence for his assertions. This kind of information usually fits better in your covering letter anyway, because there isn't much space for it on a CV.

```{r elevator-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionelevator)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/elevator-pitch.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionelevator) Covering letters and personal statements are your [elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch). Whatever floor you're destined for, your pitch should summarise why you're applying and what you have to offer, in a way that persuades the reader (or listener) that they should invite you to interview, before they get out of your metaphorical elevator. Elevator image by Downtowngal is licensed CC BY via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/5wGF](https://w.wiki/5wGF) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Let's say you're applying for a widget engineering position at the world famous [widgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget): `widget.com`. There are three things you need to convey in the following order:

1. **Why them?** Why are you applying to `widget.com`
1. **Why that role?**  Employees of `widget.com` have many different roles and responsibilities but what is it about being a junior `widget engineer` or trainee `widget scientist` (say) that attracts you?
1. **Why you?** Why should `widget.com` employ you? What skills and experience make you stand out from all the other hopeful widgeteers? What are your [Unique Selling Points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_selling_proposition) (USPs)? Say why *you* would be good for *them* (**not** why widget.com would be good for you and your career).

You can see some examples of answers to these questions at:

* [prospects.ac.uk/careers-advice/cvs-and-cover-letters/cover-letters/sample-cover-letter](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/careers-advice/cvs-and-cover-letters/cover-letters/sample-cover-letter)
* [targetjobs.co.uk/cv-and-cover-letter-templates](https://targetjobs.co.uk/cv-and-cover-letter-templates)
*  [www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/cl](https://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/cl/)


### Does anyone actually READ covering letters? {#elevatorpitch}
Some employers will read your covering letter very carefully, others less so. It is not always clear which employers will bother and which won't.

Even if *nobody* reads your covering letter, it is still worth writing one because formulating answers to the three basic questions in section \@ref(we3qs) will force you to rehearse standard interview questions.

You can think of your covering letter as writing and rehearsing some of the lines of your elevator pitch shown in figure \@ref(fig:elevator-fig).

### Embedding a personal statement {#bullshit}
You might be tempted to embed a short summary or `personal statement` section at the top of your CV after your header. If you're thinking about doing this, keep it short or just leave it out altogether. Why? Here's an example of how *not* to do it from **Sir Professor Don Malaka** [FRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society) who holds the Endowed Chair of Rhetoric at the [University of Poppleton](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/academic/laurie):

::: {.rmdnote}

`I have a proven track record of delivering excellent teaching and outstanding learning experiences for all of my students, whatever their background. I am also a committed and diligent leader who can deliver large and ambitious projects on time and to budget. I am also capable of leading cross-disclipinary teams of colleagues towards excellent and innovative results that align closely with strategic educational objectives.`

:::

Are you persuaded by Professor Malakas personal statement? I *hope* you are not convinced because it [smells of bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit), see figure \@ref(fig:bullshit-fig). One of the reasons the statement smells dodgy is because it makes lots of assertions without providing any actual evidence. Is Professor Hotair trying to persuade us to disregard the truth? Without evidence, it is hard to tell which of their assertions are true or false, so the whole statement risks being ignored as bullshit or lies. [@onbullshit]

```{r bullshit-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbullshit)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/on-bullshit.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionbullshit) Yes, your CV is trying to persuade the reader to invite you to an interview. However, being persuasive doesn't mean you have to try and [bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit) your reader by exaggerating your achievements or telling lies. People who have to read your CV will probably be trawling through *hundreds* of others too. This means your readers will have *highly trained and sensitive* bullshit detectors, so you should avoid wasting their valuable time by shovelling even more bullshit onto their overloaded plates. Fair use image of the cover of [Harry G. Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Frankfurt)'s best selling little book *[On Bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit)* [@onbullshit] via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/6Bnu](https://w.wiki/6Bnu) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

On a one page CV, you rarely have space to include any of this kind of hot air anyway. High level statements usually fit better on a covering letter see section \@ref(we3qs). A shorter, less *bullshitty* personal statement from a student is shown below:

::: {.rmdnote}

`Hello, my name is Mike Rokernel. I am a second year student in Computer Science at the University of Poppleton looking for an industrial placement in software engineering`

:::

Is this better? Personally, I think you should only include a personal statement on your CV if you've got space to do so because you'll often just repeat facts from your CV anyway, like Mike's example above. Save the beautiful persuasive rhetorical prose for your covering letters and make reference to key facts on your CV. There are usually much more interesting and appetising things you can say about yourself on your CV. üí©

## Debugging summary {#tldr7}
(ref:tldr)

Your future is bright, your future needs debugging. Debugging your future will help you test future. Testing your future will help you to start coding your future.

In this chapter we have looked at how to debug your future, with a particular focus on your CV (or r√©sum√©) and any supporting written communication. If you fix the bugs we've described here, before an employer sees your CV, you'll stand a *much* better chance of getting an interview. The checklist in section \@ref(checklist) is a good place to start debugging your CV. 

<!--https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1570060516839641092-->

*Some* of the strategies you apply to debugging your *actual* code, can also be applied to debugging your future:

* Inspect, don't squash bugs, take time to reflect (see section \@ref(reflecting)) and *understand* any bugs you find in your future [@pocketdebugging]
* Being stuck is temporary, see section \@ref(nevergiveup)
* Check your assumptions, especially if debugging the `content` bugs described in section \@ref(ilo7) makes you anxious or depressed, see chapter \@ref(nurturing)
* Don't go it alone, grow your network, see section \@ref(weakties)
* Build your debugging toolkit by identifying your strengths and weaknesses, see chapter \@ref(exploring)

<!-- except there isn't always a reason!-->

Debugging your future can be an enjoyable adventure! Debugging your future is Coding your future. 

In the next part, chapter \@ref(hacking): *Hacking your Future* you'll improve your CV writing skills by going beyond debugging your own CV and debugging other people's instead.
