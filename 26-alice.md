So, welcome Alice, thank you for coming on the show. So, it'd be good to hear more about your journey from student professional. You've been here for four years and lots happened in four years. You've done a lot of things.

A lot of things have happened in the world in the last four years, you've had your graduation yesterday. Yeah, which was very cool. And so can you tell us a little bit more about what? Let's start with, what's your name and where'd you come from? Yes. So, I thank you for having me.

My name is actually Alexandra By go by Alice this to not confuse people. I, I'm coming. How do I say your surname because I've struggled with your surname. Good. Um, so it depends. So in the Romanian you have a little hat on top of the a, which is pronounce a.

But the thing is, when I fill in forms or anything here, obviously I can't I can't put the hat on so the British version I think would be Paco Raru right okay the correct version in my opinion is gorilla Buckurado okay but it depends how you roll. Your eyes is a bunch of things involved in it.

So it go, I go by anything. When I when I hear back I'm like okay it's me and you're from Romania. Yeah really. So my Romanian geography. It's kind of a circle ish. The fish. Oh it looks like a fish in my opinion. You've got the black sea? Yeah I just yeah I got Bucharest in the south.

Are you from Bucharest or somewhere? Right. So yeah. That's easy to locate them. Yeah. Just so it's quite easy. I feel like your geography ever mean is really good because I've been asking if it's a village in the UK before. So what if Bucharest is a village? No, for Romania, is a village in the UK and I was like, Not really, but sure, okay good.

So can you say a little bit about what made you choose? So to two study yeah. What made you choose computer science as a thing to study for four years? Yeah, so I'll begin by announcing that I am doing fear. I did do I'm not doing anymore, I finished computer science with business and management and I feel the reason behind it is because I was very unsure what I wanted to study, I kind of want.

I really liked organising, little events for my high school so I was thinking maybe business or management might be cool but then I joined the robotics club in my high school and then I was like, well, computer science, quite cool but maybe not on its own because it was an all more or less a boys club and it was robotic.

So it's a lot more hardware than I personally like and then and then I was thinking maybe I should do something completely different. I don't know why. I have a theory that everyone at one point wants to do criminology. I'm not show exactly what happens. Maybe, just because it sounds really cool.

But I wanted to do that as well. And then, in the end, I decided that I want to study something that I feel is challenging for three years. Just because I had a fear of getting bored of my degree because it's three years. It's a lot of doing just one degree.

So then I was like, you know what? I'm just gonna do computer science, seems a very challenging so for me, at least, so I'm gonna have a lot of fun and also do a complete with business and management just because University of Manchester, obviously, they stopped doing the course, but it was out the point where I applied one of the only, I think four or five uni.

Okay, that's interesting. Offered the course, right? So had you done studied computer science formally at school? Or was it something on the edges? Like you say like there was a club or something where people did stuff? We did study formally as well, you got to pick in high school, which part of high school, you want to do, if you want to do humanities or Sciences and in sciences, you can choose between life, sciences and life, sciences and computer science, and maths, and I just picked a computer science and maths, which is called Informatics in Romania, which is basically computer science.

We did a little bit of coding with the C++ by a little bit. I mean we were coding algorithms, but when we would ask anything further than that, it would be quite difficult for us to comprehend. What was happening? Why we need class names, etc, etc. So I really like a heavy language to start with.

Yeah, we're also doing it on paper. We did have a Informatics lab in our, and we kind of knew how to use. I think we're using code blocks, so, run codes, but day-to-day, just because we're so many students, we couldn't all fit in that lab. So we're just coding on paper.

So I feel like that's even more difficult because then you write on paper and then the teacher needs to be like yeah. That's not right. Checking. Yes in Christ. Yeah you can't run in be like why the teacher needs to tell you but I think it's really good for debugging now because then when I came to uni and then we're doing Java, the lecturer asked us to code on paper before I never was so outraged.

I was like oh this is like school. So I think it's good. Maybe and I think maybe it develops skills in code reading perhaps in that you're not computer science often focuses on writing code. And that's a skill. You need to learn but actually reading other people's code. Maybe doing it on paper helps you?

Yeah, it does help because they think a bit more carefully about what you're doing. You're not just well let's try that and see if it works. Exactly. And it's also, you know, when you write an algorithm and you need to check it against test cases, like an interview, for example, it's so it's not about the idea they need to check.

It's about, where do you put on the paper, the variables. And then remember how they update, like, kind of having a little framework for that, that really helped me. So, yeah, that's how I ended up in computer science. Good. Okay. So, how did when you got here? How did it meet with your expectations?

Was it like, okay, this is kind of what I was expecting or were there any sort of surprises way thought? Well, this is a bit different to what I was expecting. Well, I'd like to add the fact that I've never been in Manchester before coming here, for my graduate for my freshers week.

So expectation. Don't know UK, I guess. Oh, I went to London once. Does that count? I don't know. Maybe, so the UK. Yeah, it was quite fun but then I came to Manchester's. One. Everything was new to I got day late because I thought freshers means a day of a week of parties, right?

So I was like, oh it's fine. I found a better flight for Tuesday so I was like, surely no one's gonna miss me for one day. I actually missed the first lecture and my first lab. So I had to join a different lab. Okay, so I was there, I think I was in LF31, right?

And we got the little booklet with the raspberry pies. And I didn't have a data because the data was bad. And then a 31, I did not have to connect the Wi-Fi and I had to follow this little booklet and I didn't know what a Raspberry Pi was but I was too afraid to google it because people would see my screen, it was very funny.

So that was traumatic to say but oh, great start. Yeah. What is funny is that I was talking to all of my other friends that weren't really doing hardware, before uni, and all of them funded the same. So it's quite funny now to kind of see how far we've come.

So I feel like it's also nice because now if someone know why everyone that talks to a computer scientist, they expect them to know everything. So that I'm so sorry. I don't know how computer works. I'm there. Like, I don't know. Either it's fine. Um, well, you kind of do you know more about it than you did for years ago?

Yeah, no, obviously obviously I do know that, but it was quite funny. So in terms of the first day, a very intense, but then I feel like it's good because then I had to ask questions. So I just had to be like, you know, Alice. Let's put the ego aside, and let's just go somewhere and beg someone to explain to me what's happening.

But in terms of the first, yeah, I really liked it. I thought I had obviously a little bit of an advantage just because I did a coding, right? A little bit before. So, I think that was very helpful for me in the idea that it was a bit less overwhelming.

I mean, obviously that other friends that I know that they didn't do any coding before I think Carmen mentioned it that she never did coding before coming to uni, so I'm pretty sure they handled it. Well, as well. I just feel like for me, it was a bit easier, just because I got time to kind of be like, at least at least I could show them how bubble saw works and maybe they'll leave me for a bit.

So I found it really nice expectations. I didn't have any, but I really enjoyed it but also again doing computer science with business men. That I wasn't doing any of the hardware courses, right? Which I feel like my have been a bit more overwhelming for me just because I have no experience in hardware, right?

But it was really nice. I love the first year. Team project and so fast forwarding to well. So what did you do in your first 18 project? What you did a built a thing? Can you remember? So yeah, time ago now. Oh my god. I remember it clearly. It was called unicycle.

Okay, and it was this app. I think someone was telling me everyone does that. Like there's at least one team that does it. I think they were two teams and I, yeah, that did it. But we incorporated more parts of things that we felt like you need students need.

Which obviously one of them was having a list of ingredients and spitting out the recipes. That's the go-to for everyone. Yeah, I think we had another bit, which was a talent Google Calendar integration. Um, so you can see your classes where they are at deadlines. And then the other one was a Yelp API, right?

Where you could see the closest clubs around you, but we kind of connected all of them. So, for example, if you're looking for club on Friday evening and you had a deadline on Monday, it wouldn't let you because you have a deadline Monday. It was quite fun. It was really low level and but we had so much fun doing it and it worked then.

So sometimes yeah. First your team projects go bang. Because of, it's not because of technology because of politics. Yeah, just kind of look of the draw like which team you're in. So your team worked. Well, Yeah, I mean, I don't think it would we weren't best friends, but we didn't hate each other.

That we were just kind of there. Like, let's figure out. Let's figure something out. And you, we won something as well, which is so funny. We want the most world improving idea with the recipe bit. I was like, we definitely sold it really well. Right? Because we were out there giving up body and soul to the judges, telling them how amazing and innovative idea is.

So it worked out in the end. We had a lot of fun. Good so fast, water second year. So this is, when you happening things started happening and you were applying for placement, said you decided before that you were going to do a placement or was it something? Because some people decide at the beginning the second year, like, oh, that's a good idea.

Let's do that. I do decided before you came or So you'd already. You knew that you wanted to do a placement right from the beginning? Yeah, for me was actually one of the reasons why I wanted University of Manchester just because obviously I wanted to go abroad which is in its own.

A big cost for anyone coming from. Especially I feel like a country where people unless than the country they are going in. So for example, from Romania to the UK, so I was kind of like a little plan. I was pitching it to my parents and I was like you support me for two years from then on.

I'm on my own I'll do a little placement. I'll put money aside, I'll do my last two years of uni so that was the plan from the beginning and that's why Manchester was my because also the people that I knew that graduated from Manchester did the same thing. They did the replacement, they really liked it.

So there was kind of my top choice, I think it played a big role of picking University of Manchester and so what where were you looking for jobs to do? What was your strategy did you have a strategy? Don't think I I'm not sure because I did so I did the spring insights in first.

Yeah. Okay. So that would have helped. So we actually for people who don't know what's a spring inside. Oh yeah, people don't know this stuff. True. Because that's also that's also another thing I found out for my past leaders. Well also my friends but they did one and they were like you only to apply because it's so fun.

It's so important and everything. So I did the same in when I was a person that was a JP Morgan, was it? I did at Morgan Stanley and Barclays right at two of them and that's like a week two weeks, is it? Yeah. Springs. That means Easter break. Mm-hmm.

So it kind of depends so it's bring inside is basically a week long or two week long in mini internship, in which the company that you're interning at just gives you a little bit of a taste of what happened is happening. They do a lot of really nice events for the interns.

They explain what the company is doing for banks. Obviously they have a lot of explaining to do because not no one in computer science has a finance background. And in general I don't think any 19 year old or firstly student knows anything about banking anyway so they do a lot of explaining they pay you with someone in the industry to shadow them salary as such they pay like accommodation and expenses.

I think so addition and they feed you, right? And some companies do also pay you separately, which was really nice, you know, to kind of get my first money ever. And then I think the thing about that is the good thing about it is then you've got a big name on your CV.

So when you were applying for placements in your second year you had Barkley's and, you know, big names on your CV. Yeah. And say you know, even if you don't go into banking, it's like, well, I've done this. Exactly kind of shows that you took initiative and you applied and you had to interact with people like this and you also got it.

So it's kind of like, well, definitely. They did something right. Right. But I do feel, it's kind of a small downside just because obviously the companies that do have the means to run week, long internships for students are also the big and so they kind of like a few tech companies.

Yeah. So that there's not much diversity. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not gonna finally startup doing a spring inside. Exactly. It's mostly. It's mostly banks or consultancies, I think, right. But there's the valuable. Yeah, important things to the experience and to see how it feels just because in especially in computer science.

I feel like After graduate you realise that the way that so many avenues in which we can go to but now it's even more growing, the banking and the financial bit. So I think it's quite nice from the beginning to kind of, try out to see how it is.

I personally So again I do think springing in size are really important. I suggested to everyone to apply just because it's kind of like not that many people apply obviously because you know first semester you and you don't know what's happening. Why I apply for internships but there were so useful and relatively.

I mean not easy, but easier you if you're applying for an internship permanent job it the interview might be a bit more involved. But an interview for a spring insight, probably a bit less, you know, not so, not so difficult. Yeah. Because they're just kind of checking that you're not.

Yeah. Crazy or it is. Yeah, it is very much also behavioural heavy and I feel like it really helped me because what you mean by behaviour the interviews, right? So they're asking you a lot trying to find out about your personality. Yeah, and I feel like that helped me so much when I was looking to my friends that were obviously applying for placements, or after for grad jobs, They're kind of talking like, oh, I don't even know how to prepare for a behaviour interview, right?

Because you get to second your third year where you know the hard really hard bits will be the technical and you kind of like think behavioural like oh, it's fine. I'll just talk to them right? And because obviously, in firstly, I was so panicked because I was like oh my god this is my first interview ever.

I did all the prep, I would be like reading that Twitter to find cool things. I can talk to them about a reading their values, finding things that I did that match with their values. I kind of buzzword that their values, always good corporation, find it and just finding out what the company does and be surprised, how many people turn at 20 views without any idea what the actual business does?

Exactly? When they're asked a question light. So what are our values? It kind of doesn't look very good if the candidate goes. I don't know. Yeah. But what do we do? What are our products? Don't know, But how difficult to find to prepare for those kind of questions? I think exactly it is quite difficult.

But for like it's also, Um, I feel like it's also really important because you kind of figure out how the company is as well, I'm culture or hopefully the culture which initially, I thought like, oh, you know, I just want a job. I don't really care if I magical to our magical culture, you know, I'll see how it is and I'll match it but then I realise it matters so much.

Also, by doing the spring inside, I realised. What type of companies? I would be a good fit to. In the idea that I'm it's not necessarily I'd be miserable by that job. It's just they have better people to hire that much, their company and the type of work ethics that they have.

So you wouldn't have you didn't feel like you would have fit well into that, the bank corporate banking world. Yeah, exactly. Just because you it's interesting to see and you learn lots and you get some names on. You actually think, okay. Thanks but no, thanks, exactly. Actually really obviously, I still enjoyed that, I think so after I did a summer internship with Barclays, which they offered right after the spring inside, right?

So that's what seem to be as kind of like, almost like a week-long job interview. Some of them are they're looking for summer interns. If you do well in the spring insight then they'll say hey why not? Come and do a summer intern. Exactly. And after the some mentorship they're like oh why not a grad scheme.

So you did a summer internship but say, hang on so you did. This is you've done quite a lot of things here, so you did. Let's bring inside at Morgan. Samuel Sandbox and Barclays and then you just summer internship advice at the end of your first year? Yes. Okay.

Oh no. At the end of my second. Oh yeah, they offer you for because it's kind of like oh in first day you do a spring inside and between second and third year, you did summer internship and then in their head is after that, okay? You come for the company, right?

Obviously what they didn't know was that I want to do a placement, I also ignored it for my CV for that one. I was like, oh yeah, sure, sure, take. Give me a some internship. I it's fine. Yeah. No. I think it was really nice. Are we another thing?

I really enjoyed the summer internship. At Barclays as well. I did it in technology. I wasn't where were you in? It was from my I was reminded as this this is just as the pandemic just after the pandemic. Yeah. So at the end of your second year. Yeah, so the other sort of elephant in the room here just started nicely your second year and then it all went, I mean overshaped starting nicely the amount of deadlines and applications I was doing it.

There were, I know, I feel like it was nice in the idea that, you know, in second year you have your first year kind of side meeting people not necessarily a group based on meeting people. Then in second years, almost like this. It's, I don't know. It's I feel like in the first weeks, it was really relaxing, right?

Because the first weeks before all kind of like waiting for the deadlines to come and it's quite nice because you start making friends better. You start helping each other with wax is be nice, but then then the applications for job start hitting. How do you balance that? Because you got demanding workload.

Yeah, and you're also trying to apply for jobs. So, how did you navigate that? I personally think I didn't balance it pretty. Well, kind of staying up. Yeah, I was kind of like, brute force. You know, let's see what we're doing today, but I think the problem is, I, I remember in second year, it was when most of the teacher in the lecturers started talking about, maybe don't expect a hundred percent for your coursework just because keep talking, okay?

It's the screens. Just it's yeah, gone to sleep, but the microphone still recording. Lovely. So yeah, why wants to say is obviously the teachers start talking to you about not expecting a hundred percent for every coursework which obviously don't get a hundred percent in 30 either, but you do get quite good grade.

Is this is this Romanian thing and you you were getting in different come different countries, have different cultures done that but you could get 10 out 10 or something. Yeah. But then, I don't think it's that, but out obviously there's a little problem with the greed inflation, right? Because you don't want to give 10 to everyone, but I found it so weird in the UK, but I don't think it's gonna say UK.

I think it's also like an academia thing. People are like, oh 100%, that's for no one. Like, no one. You're going 100%. And I'm like, then why have it? You know? But obviously. So that was a student yesterday. Yeah. Got an award for an average of 91%, which I've, you know, plus super high.

I know. I know, you know, that that was exactly I was like, but that's that's that's impressive As you. So, as you while we're talking about that you want a prize, didn't you? So can you say a little bit about the prize that you want at graduation yesterday? Yes.

So, it was really, I got ahead of department award. So this head of department award is given I think, to maximum 5 students a year. I was reading or for I think four of us got something like that, so we do Carmen Shino and Rin. Yes, I believe. If I hope I'm not missing anyone.

Sorry. Um, but we got the award for all the work that we did throughout the years in the life of the Department of Computer Science which was really sweet. And I think I was that was really important, that's always a really important thing because and especially during coronavirus because everyone's had a horrible time, you know, students and stuff alike and sort of keeping that community through parse and other stuff has been really important to people.

I think and you know you know, not everyone needs it, not everyone wants it but the people that do need it and want it, find it really valuable. So it's I think it's really important what you you and the rest of the team have done with that. Because important stuff.

So, yeah. Now we're going back. So we're going back to we were talking about jobs. So yeah. Second year balancing, your applying for placements and your, your applying for lots of things exactly working. Very hard on lots of things. Exactly. So when did things start to happen, so I guess this this with an at that time there would have been hiring freezes coming in of companies saying, oh, actually, you know what, we're not gonna do placements because of covid.

Yeah. Or we're not sure we don't know yet. So when did you get what point in the year? Did you get your place? Yeah. So the pandemic started in March, right? I mean well you know like the lockdown restrictions and everything around end of March. I so I started applying, I think so September.

I started applying for jobs. I've been doing face-to-face interviews. I've been doing a couple of face to fit. I don't think I did that many another thing because of the spring insights, I started being a bit more picky with my internships. Obviously, this is a very risky approach I believe.

Because I was talking to people that were like, oh yeah, I just applied to 500 interviews. I'm like, I don't want to work at those companies, so I'm not gonna apply to them. But my, my tactic was, I'm gonna apply to the big bangs which I know I don't want to do an internship at obviously get the practise.

Yeah, exactly. To get the practise because I cannot for the life of me, make myself do leap code, or to do hacker rank. I just cannot do it. I don't know why I'll start doing it and then it doesn't work out and I'm like, you know, what, in the interview I'll just figure out.

So, I was like, let's just give myself an extra incentive and actually I show up in London at an interview and talk to the person, surely that will make me do a little bit of leap code, right? Yeah. And I think it's afraid of got to practise. I mean, you can practise standard interview questions.

Yeah, but yourself from the mirror but then that will help a little bit but actually the only way to get good at doing interviews is to do into, yes, and you don't really want that first interview to be that job that you really want, like a company that you really love.

You want some try on, you want to get a bit of practise first. And it also depends so much on the vibes. I decided, I decided I competitize. Even though that technical interviews and coding, it depends so much on the vibes. I feel like that's very unprofessional to say, but I have been so many moments in which I felt like making a mistake in the code was, oh my god.

This person should me now. It's gone. It's gone, it's fine. And then other moments in which I'd make a mistake in the interview would be so helpful to like guide me. That at the end of the interview, I'd be like, oh I think it was really good that I made the mistake because then they they saw how well I react to the little hint that they gave me and then I figured out in the end so things like this, I feel like you only get through practise right.

You can't really do code on your own and talk to yourself in front of. Even if you do it with a friend I feel like behaviorals is really nice to do with friends but I feel like technical ones, I don't I just can't do it with friends. I was just like giggling So so interview.

Yes, so yes. So you so we're into March. The pandemic has hit everything's online. I i just you're doing interviews via zoom. I guess actually I got job so yeah, sorry that's why I want to say. So I started applying to the big companies in the first semester right before Christmas.

It's got a bit stressful because it wouldn't work out, and those companies wouldn't hire me. I know I got, oh my god. I'm not gonna say the name. I know it's not allowed to say the name, but I was interviewing. I just really big investment bag in hours. I don't think, I don't know.

I thought I was doing a good job at the technical interview. I thought I was doing a too good of a job because he was asking me very obscure questions of Java that somehow remembered. And then the next question was, who's the CEO of the company? And I looked at here in the middle of the technical?

No, I think it was. I also at the end, I was like, at that point I was a bit like cocky. I was like, oh my god, I know this. And then the next question, who's the CEO of the company? The funny thing is, I just came from a room with like, 200.

Posters of that, man. Obviously, was a man, right? And I was just looking at him and I started doing this monologue about how I don't care about men in power. So I don't know his name, but it doesn't matter that, I don't know, It was, it was really bad.

So yeah, things like this happen. I mean, I think I think there is a good interviewer. We'll ask you difficult questions, but sometimes there's a bit of a power imbalance. Yeah. And somebody sometimes people ask you a nasty question. Yeah. Just because they can and they want to see you suffer.

Exactly. So that's happened. I think guess that's probably happened to you, maybe. I mean, that sounds a bit like that in somebody's like, well, I'm just gonna ask it, nasty question. Yeah, I just like to treat it as, you know, like nasty, a question actually, who's a CEO should have been telling the people licence.

Then I was like, by the way, just researching the CEO just do yourself a favour and just know the name. You don't need to know what he's doing, but just know the name. One, one product, and one service that the company makes and then you'll put it. But yeah, so I was in these interviews.

I didn't manage to get a job by Christmas, which was really stressful because all of my, most of my friends, got their jobs by Christmas. So it wasn't necessarily. I knew there were other companies that would hire, it's just because my friends got the jobs already. I was a bit like, always how much a bit alone in this now, after Christmas, I did some more interviews actually.

I think my interview because I did my place. Now, the hot group in Manchester, oh, to be fair. It was remote. But, you know, it was supposed to be a Manchester. When did that in, when did it offer come through? So, the interview happened in February, it was also online because they were really quickly to react to like with restrictions, they were like sorry.

We're not letting anyone in our offices. We're doing it online. I was like, okay, sure. So it was still online the interview and they sent me the off I think that day after. So it's like beginning of February. That was it, you like great? I've got a job. Exactly.

That was like, I can relax, but then the stress came with when the pandemic hit, probably in the lockdown started. There were so many companies that were cancelling, their placements, and their internships. So, we got updated quite constantly through Barclays, like it's fine. We're still doing it. It's probably remote.

I was like great. But then the place when they were quite quiet for a while but in the end. Yeah. In the end. It was just quite in general. I think there were a lot to think to handle, but they're like, you know, it's it's fine. We'll still see you.

So for people who don't know, Tia the hook, well, there used to be called hut group. They're called THG now really themselves. So what do THG upgroup do? So I like to answer this question truly, I don't know they're doing a little thing at throughout the end throughout the through, the whole placement.

I was figuring out what they were doing the really sweet and that sense that I think to the core that in e-commerce company. So they basically handling the website of e-commerce websites. And it was a little logistics in the background. Yeah, warehouses, yeah. With robots and all that kind of stuff.

Exactly. They do the warehouses bit fulfilment. They would call it. Exactly Amazon. Call it. Oh, yeah. I think they're called it too. The same way I wasn't working in the centre. It sounds great. Doesn't it the fulfilment centre? Yeah, you could be from Philadelphia, the intelligence that comes with it, but I was working on, oh my god, actually loved it.

I was working on that influencer platform. So what they would basically do besides the e-commerce bit, they would also kind of create on their own products that the e-commerce companies need. One of memoir influencer platform. So it's kind of like a platform to handle influences and paid them and talk to them and whatever like youtubers.

And yeah, exactly people. Flogging stuff on Twitter and Instagram and exactly and TikTok. I think I'm not sure, right? But it was it was really nice. I actually loved it because it was quite funny. I came into the company. So at that time, right, I did, my summer internship at Barclays but I didn't do it in coding.

It was kind of like, technology analyst I think was called, it was really sweet. I had such a good time that it was just I realised it's not really for me. Although the older people are very sweet. It's just, I don't know. I didn't fit perfectly that company. So I had a little bit of confidence in the sense that I knew how to chat to people.

I was like, it's fine. I was here for like, 10 weeks. I might I'm here now for, yeah, it's gonna be fine. But I started coding and obviously was a bit of a shot for me because because of the pandemic, obviously the university kind of re with while. We don't really need your grades for second year, so it's fine.

You don't need to do the exams. Do you actually think I was coding in my free time during the pandemic not really? I was kind of doing yoga and chilling right in the house reading. So it kind of got out practise. Yeah, I got out probably a little bit having to do algorithms again.

Exactly. And not even algorithms because I started with front end so I just not anything, I just knew a little bit of HTML That was it and we started with React. So I was a little bit scared but the funny thing is that because it was a influence of platform, I was the youngest that I was also.

I'm pretty sure the one that spent the most time on Instagram. So all of the questions about APIs and kind of talking about how to even system questions at one point, I would just find myself chatting, even though first months through meetings just because I would know like these the difference between the views for a real and opposed and what it means to add a sound on and copyrights and everything just because I was on Instagram.

All so I really like my project because I was I love that So I had a really good time down. That was though that did you were you working on that the influence of influence of platform for the whole 12 months or just rotate? No, I want you sometimes they do rotation.

I think I don't know if no I don't think they do rotations for TGS fires. I'm concerned because they didn't have time. But I did the rotation the way that I thought I were front and thinking I want to do just front end and I started doing back in and then eventually falls back.

So it's kind of like rotation within the team. It was really sweet and any preference from 10 backend. Or do you like doing both? I really like doing, but I really like content in general. It's just annoys me so much. The idea that you can't finish a feature on its own, usually like a bigger one, just because you need the backend work as well and also I feel like I've applied more knowledge.

I had from uni in backhand it kind of feels nice. It's not a huge amount of front end stuff. Yeah, because there's a little bit, you do a bit of the first year, team project. And then you might you may or may not build a fairly big frontend for that, but it's mostly there's mostly back in, and it makes right because fronting technology has changed so much and so dependant on the language of women that we use, Whereas obviously, I didn't use, I didn't use the backend that I did in software engineering is just the algorithms were there.

Yeah. So I could remember like a little sorting function that I could put in and that worked regardless of the language or the framework that were you. And I guess, I mean, would you say, is it first say that front end stuff is relatively easy to pick up or not?

I mean, if you like if you've not done any react. Yeah. And but you know a little bit of I know basic HTML and CSS. For example. Yeah. How easy is it to pick up React? I think, I think it's easy to pick up. I just think it's hard to do so it's quite like, you can get into it quickly but then I would quickly realise how bad my code from the beginning was like, it's kind of you pick it up and if you don't do it properly, you're probably not going to be that good at it and you're not gonna be able to do that many things with it.

But obviously it's easy to pick up in the sense that You can do something simple quite quickly. Yeah so that that's always nice. Obviously in back and you need you can't really do something easy or maybe yeah you can make it more efficient etc. But as soon need a lot of knowledge to even get the first part.

Yeah, through. Yeah. So yeah. That was lovely. Okay good. So, and so may we've talked a little bit about this but the weather there are many other obstacles that you faced in finding employment. During I mean, I think we talked about most of them. Were there any anything else that we haven't mentioned about your struggle to find a job?

I, I feel like the main struggle was to find a job that matched what I needed in the idea that did a placement. I've liked a lot easier to find companies that you like that do grad schemes, just because in the worst case scenarios just apply for an entry job level, whereas having a placement also, because there's so many types of placements, right?

They're also three-month placement. Six months placement finding one company was quite limiting choices. So that kind of raised the bar with the interviews and it was a bit more stress involved, but I think the main hall was just kind of juggling everything and preparing for interviews. There were kind of the first technical interviews I've done as well, right?

So it was that. So we're going to a couple of things here. So main things you learnt, would you say what the main things you learnt from doing your urine industry. Also, I've decided because I was talking to this with a lot of people that did placement in general.

And I think the main thing that I learnt was to be more confident and confident in the sense not necessarily to speak in a meeting. Although obviously that's also really helpful confident in the way that when someone comes with an issue, I don't panic. If I don't know straight away it's kind of like someone tells me oh can you do this by?

I don't know. Like, as soon as possible and then I'm not like, oh my god, I don't know this language, I don't know what this word means. I've never heard of it in my life. It's kind of like always fine. I'll figure out, I'll google it. I'll ask someone, it's kind of like having so many moments, which you don't know what is happening and having to force yourself to learn about it and to google it and to somehow.

And then you're somehow finish it right. I think it's really useful because in uni, when this happens, which is also roughly at the beginning of every single course, and module, you still get a little bit of guidance. So you expect it to know some things from before. I feel like when people give you a job, something they're not necessarily like oh you should know this.

It's kind of like, can you please figure out and do something for me? So I feel like confidence came to it and it also applied to a lot of things, right? Like if someone would ask me to help them with an interview or to finish a project or to apply to a company or whatever it was kind of.

Like, I don't know what's happening, but I'll figure out in the end. Yeah, so yeah, good. Okay. So let's move on to finally a project. So you've done your placement, you've come back to university and things were returning to normal at this point so you've done that your entirety of your placement online.

Yeah. Except the last writing stuff at the end the last right. Okay, so you did finally get to actually meet the people that you yeah. Working with yeah, must have been kind of good, I guess, but kind of at the same time a little bit crazy, it was kind of really weird just because I got used to staying in the house and having snacks all the time next to me.

And then, if you like being after being one year at home and your own comfort, like if you want to just call someone or to clean your oven, in the middle of the day, you can just take 10 minutes and it's done. However, then when I had in those Fridays to go to work, I was like what if I'm very thirsty?

Oh I kind of lost all social connection anyway, it was fine though. It was fun. Yeah, good. So back to university things were returning to normal. And so what was your what was your? I mean I know what you'll find your project. Yeah for our listeners. Can you explain what you did for?

You'll find a project. I my final year project was called coding their future and my tutor was, you Duncan house. Yeah. And for my final year project, I basically helped and supported a teaching computer science from us a secondary school in Greater Manchester in in computer science to their pupils.

So I feel like it's quite open-ended which are quite liked and the idea that we could figure out what we wanted to do after talking to this teacher, who would be like providing them with an application that would help them or teaching literally every single week to the kids or doing a couple of one-off teaching sessions with the students.

So it's really nice. It was really nice. In general, the aspect of being able to kind of use my third year project and actually help someone just because I obviously third year projects have really nice or some of the titles on that list when you have to select that.

I really flashy and sound really cool but in the end I was kind of like if I do have a year. I mean yeah a couple of months and I can do something I might as well kind of use what I know to just help someone and I've like education is really rewarding in that sense because you can genuinely, it's quite dramatic to say change someone's.

I've probably I didn't change anyone's lives but it's just like kind of help star. Some, you dance towards them which is something that is very dear to my heart especially for women in STEM. So we should say the school is Fairfield high school for girls. Yes. In a state school in Droyaliston.

Manchester and we need to, We need to acknowledge Mrs. Roland, don't we? Because Mrs, Roland is amazing. She's been that hosting students for the last. I think it's about eight years now. Like, yourself. And I think the interesting thing about school is because it's a single sex school, they don't have this thing of some schools.

Have a thing like where all computer sciences for boys. Yeah. Or the girls will be put off it because there's not a good gender balance in the classroom. Exactly that. Yeah, that, that is clearly a big problem and miss a ruling was absolutely amazing. And in general, I think it's so good.

She was always saying how amazing it is to kind of bring students in the like universities students in the classroom, just because it kind of gives them a better incentive and creates a different dynamic in school. It makes it even more exciting and interesting for the students to find out more about computer science.

So, she's truly amazing for being able to do this when general teaching, I like teachers are amazing in general because it's so difficult and you're a role model in a way that a teacher. I mean a teacher is a role model. Yeah, you're a role model in the sense that you're somebody who's worked as a software engineer.

Yeah. So they can see oh that's, you know, that that's a possible thing to do. Yeah, exactly. It's kind of like someplace like maybe go and they might not think that straight away. Yeah. But they might maybe later on they'll think oh yeah. I remember, I remember doing that school and yeah, it was that it might sometimes it takes a long time for those seeds that you've planted to germinate.

It might be quite a lot later. Yeah. And I know I think I was alright so I did a format, the end to kind of ask the students questions. And one of the question was, if you know anyone that works in technology, I didn't even put, you know, something programmable web, it's just in general technology.

And I think most of them probably around 70% or something like that. Didn't know anyone or the ones that didn't know like the other part of the just for women to name women who yeah technology. Yeah. And there's some of them course, obviously they wouldn't. They probably didn't read the question probably, but it was kind of like obvious.

I feel like they still kind of had this impression that in the end society gives you that science and stem and specifically computer science for men. But I feel like given the fact that they didn't know anyone that worked in the environment, the fact that they got not only to meet Mr Roland who's teaching the subject and I think it's so she's teaching it really well.

So it's very important for them to kind of have her as a figure that's always been important to just get to know me because it's kind of like if they do think about software engineering or about computer science. They'll be like, oh yeah. I had this random university student show up to my class a couple of times and she was a girl, and she seemed quite nice hopefully.

So I think it was quite important in that sense. Just because it kind of like most of them didn't even have an intersection with the subject I think especially in secondary school. You'll the soul is much broader than just hey, here's some subject knowledge for you. Yeah. Exactly learning.

Because it's part of a whole social system where. Yeah, and I was actually working. Oh does class. I was working with with Mr. Roland, we're kind of decided that we want to focus on in explaining to them the importance of computer science in general in life. Just because by that time most of them it's just doesn't feel nice to kind of push towards a computer science degree someone that you can clearly see.

They just don't like it. And this kind of don't like and that's kind of not the goal anyway, you don't have the objective is not to get them all to become computer scientists just saying, well no the same way as you learn English and maths, you know, just because you need those things.

Exactly in life. Now, ever, you end up doing, hmm, it's important that, you know, this stuff exactly. So I was really nice to talk to them about a lot. I think the main topic that everyone liked and enjoyed and the one that connected us the most was TikTok, right?

It's just talking about TikTok or the time I used to love saying on TikTok and say it's for research purposes, but I'd stay on TikTok. And I remember I was trying to exp them the concept of algorithms, right? So it's kind of like TikTok has this algorithm which obviously, again, it should be common knowledge because there's so many issues that comes with having this algorithm.

Oh my goodness. What it uses that show you when and why I heard about an increase of kids, having two red syndrome ticks, just because that obviously some really nice content creators on TikTok that have to write. And they just obviously just share with the world about it, which is really nice.

They raise awareness, they have a lot of fans is really create a community around it but because some some people that will perceive, I don't know like easily impressionable which to be fat. A lot of teenagers are in general. They would just start grabbing on even like these little ticks which in the end not life-threatening, right?

But it's kind of to show how much impact TikTok and that the TikToks algorithm in general, social media algorithm has on the brain. Because if you get, if you see something every single day, you create yourself this bubble, which obviously the students didn't know about right there, what 12?

They don't get to know about social media souls but they social media. So we're talking about kind of this, I kind of mentioned a little bit about body image issues just because there were at the age in which was really easy to think that everyone looks like the Instagram influences on that situation TikTok influences.

And then I think I mentioned briefly, like I was giving an example about like, a very simple way of how the algorithm works. And I was like, you know, if you're a dog person, you're most likely to stay on videos that are have dogs like to watch them or to like them or to share them.

So then TikTok lungs quickly, right? That you like dogs, and not cats that much. So a dog person TikTok is different than cats person TikToks. But then I mentioned you know, I never have dancing videos on TikTok and the girls were so shocked. They were like, what do you mean?

You've never seen the dancing video and TikTok and I was like, I have no idea why people I've never seen the Matt, like a man woman or a person in general dancing on TikTok. And I think I had to literally open my TikTok and scroll with them for, like, two minutes because it wouldn't believe me.

And I was like, see this is how the algorithm works. My algorithm is different than yours. So it was really sweet chatting. A lot ended up for my project doing a couple of games and applications for the kids to kind of figure out the basics of computer science and applied them in different situations.

I think the one that I create like I did with Mr. Roland's. After a little brainstorming session was about Word. Oh really liked it but yeah algorithm stuff. Yeah, I was kind of like different walking through the algorithm of word or and I figuring out. It was really nice.

Really rewarding and I absolutely loved it. Great. Okay, so the next bit is what comes next. So what, what your plans for the future? I'm gonna say as much, or as little as you are making, maybe your plans are still up in the air and you haven't decided yet, but they're not up here.

I also at the thing with jobs, which I'll never understand is, I never know how much you can say about them. So, I at the end of each interview, each internship, I'd be like, right? So, if like, I'll take my manager to the sign, I'll be like, right? You tell me now, what am I allowed to say?

Because obviously, like, if you code something for you, I can't really tell them the code base, right? Someone asks, but I'm pretty sure no. And told me not to say, well, I'm gonna do next Either way. I'm gonna work at a consultancy company in London, right? I'm gonna be a software engineer.

Some I think junior software engineer. So I'm really excited because I'm moving to London and a lot of my friends are moving to London, which is really exciting as well. And that is the only next I have planned. Well what's the name? Would you rather? Not spices. Oh no it's called publicist sapien right?

It's okay. They they seem publicist sapient how sapiens sapient and spell the first bit publicist publicist with an S, Right? Okay. Posts with this first of it. See and then it's esses. So that's exciting is really exciting. These moving to London because you, because I, because you've been in Manchester for four years now, haven't you?

Yeah. Doing my placement as well. I really wanted to go to London during my placement, obviously, in the end end up fine rights as well. I've been remote, but I, I'm really excited. It feels weird to leave Manchester. Now for my graduation, that I came here and I couldn't live in my flat, and I had to get a hotel and move around.

It felt so weird, but yeah, moving to London, good. Okay, well, good luck with that wish all the best, and so, there's a few other things, a few other things left is so one of them is minority report. So, I asked people, if they identify as being a member of a minority group, we've talked about a bit about women in computing.

So I guess that's one minority group that we can talk about. So we, I think our stats are in Manchester out of about 1300 undergraduate students. Yeah, about 20% of them, a female. So you're tea? Yeah, not it's not ideal. Obviously 50% would be kind of. Yeah. But we're not there yet.

Yeah. And so, what's your experience being of that? And in the workplace as well. So and what can, what can universities and employers do to make campuses and workplaces more welcoming? Yeah to women? Well, I think my experience is quite different than someone that for example would have grown up in the UK and when to unique, I think we were talking about stats when we did that little women in STEM event and Kilbong.

We're talking about starting different countries and I think Romania is quite good with starts in terms of women in computing. So if you take informatics for example yeah your informatics class at high school was Generalized or mostly girls because I don't know. See I was just an anomaly of your school.

Most of the really taught. I don't want nicely golden super top but like a couple of the top scores in terms of like the grade you need to enter in high school because we do a little exam. It's kind of like GCSE and then depending on it it's like form that a school that you go from age 16 to 18, I know before 14.

So I know 15 to 18. So you have some kind of entrance exam but exactly basically at the age of 14. Yeah. I don't know how I, but some some of the top schools in terms of grade because I can't speak in terms of, like, if they have good results or not, I didn't look would be mostly girls.

So automatically the people that would go into the classes of informatics matter. Mathematics would be also more mostly girls. So your fellow students on that. I mean, I guess you're still in touch or you know, about some. Yeah. What sort of what sort of things did they go on?

I do, I do have plenty of female friends that went computer science and also, you know, applying in general like making the decision. They want to go to a computer science university, kind of like nicer when you know that friend. There's also like we didn't really start talking this.

Why I wanted to say, we didn't really start talking about the gender imbalance. When we were in high school just because we didn't have to just because we didn't feel like it. So an issue. Obviously, I came here. I started kind. I was not a shock then. So, you've gone from an environment where a little bit, there is no gender imbalance, or, at least it's kind of, it's in balance was men even and then all the sudden it's switched and you're in an environment which is very male-dominated.

Exactly. It was, it was really, I don't think I picked it up initially, I was, you know, I made a couple of friends were everything was fine. I signed notes saying, I think all female events and computer science and I thought I was like, oh, that's interesting, why did they need that?

I mean, obviously I knew that it went that me women could be a science but I was like why would you need just be more events. And then I started kind of like understanding how I feel like after doing like group works and everything and kind of like seeing that there are little microaggressions that people do.

So common was talking about this and we didn't really explore. You just explain what a microaggression is. So I go perhaps give an example. Yeah, I don't know that this might be wrong. I'm gonna I'm gonna do that first. But what hands from microaggression, I think what I think is it's kind of like when someone does something that they don't think it's inherently aggressive, or racist, or sexist, or whatever towards a person.

But obviously, if you think about the reason why they did it, it is It seems innocuous. Yes. Maybe you might initially think it's innocuous and it's not until afterwards. You think that was not a minute? Yeah, I was out of order. Yeah, I yeah. Happen again. I discovered all of these micro aggressions more.

I feel like my final year just because in my final years when I started hanging out, I feel like in my first two years it would be like me with one or two friends, right? So it would be like us against computer science, I guess, but in my final year I started saying more in Kilburn obviously with my third year project and I think it was also after COVID, we wanted we wanted to be yeah I'm being a parsley that we want to be in Kilba more just because we've been apart for such a long time.

I've started hanging out more with female and we started talking more about things that would happen and then I would realise some things would be microaggressions while talking to them. So, can you give but you're comfortable talking about? Yes, uncomfortable to talk. No, I'm making myself comfortable talking about it.

I feel like it's very important to just chat about things like this. I think that most important one would be, I think, months planning, which is a very delicate topic, just because some people genuinely explain in the rude, way to everyone, it's not necessarily that they explain. So man's planning being like a man explaining to someone, I think the word itself is to a female usually or someone that identifies a female as if the person they don't know.

Yeah, it's kind of like, oh let me explain to you about why your computer does this. And I'm like, thank you, I run, I wrote the program, I know why. So obviously it's quite a fine line, right? Because sometimes you don't know what the other person knows, etc. That a lot of, like, great areas.

However, sometimes like clear man's planing and initially, I just used to kind of ignoring and be, like it's fine. Just because I kind of like society kind of made that acceptable for manspling to happen and no one really questions it. But while talking to God to the girls, I'd be like, oh my god, that was Manson.

I started calling out people on it. It's quite funny, actually. I don't know if it's rude or not, but I just call them out just because I feel like it's nice. And then for them to know, if you're a man doing that, you'd be called assertive, right? But if you're a woman doing that, you might be called something not very nice.

Yeah, exactly. Learning your ground. Exactly. I'm not gonna let you do that. Exactly. So I feel like it was quite useful in the idea that just talking about, it was very important. I also noticed doing past and everything and talking to other also doing. That's why we started running the women in computer science, little pop-up events, I can call them just because we realised that just sometimes girls just don't know.

So if you hear a story, you'll be like, oh, that happened to me. That was a nice just because by when my congressions happen, I feel like they also make you feel a bit little but you don't understand why, and you think it's normal. You think maybe it's because of you, you think it's your four?

They didn't know those things before or because you didn't seem like you knew this those things before. So yeah, my progressions definitely happened. I what was the question, So how to make, how to make campuses and workplaces? I guess these would have happened at work as well, maybe. Oh, it did many things happen that work, I feel like it's a bit more, I think it was a bit more obvious at work just because obviously in computer science you interact with a lot of people, every day, 20% of them are girls.

I feel like the stats were a bit worse at work, but also, because you were, you were supposed to be in the same team all the time, right? You weren't also with COVID, you wouldn't really interact with anyone else. You would have your little team, the teams group chat and that would be it.

So it was just me and one of the girl and loads of men basically. And it was fine, it was absolutely fun but it's just kind of you wouldn't necessarily have space to talk about some things or I feel like it would be more important for workspaces in universities in general to have open conversations about it.

I also remember when we were talking because obviously in our group, we would start talking about this as the girls or complain about something and sometimes like one of the boys with us. Oh, I really know that would happen. Like I didn't know in any shape or form that that can happen to you just because I don't know, we may be overreacted at a joke that they made, which was intended to be a joke, and they wouldn't understand why.

And we started to explain to them what that joke meant to us. And why it's so stressful when so touchy. And why was so touching on the subject and feel like I'm so sorry. I did know that and it's kind of like the problem is that they didn't know that.

Right? Yeah. So I feel like talking about they're talking about good because, yeah, everyone's more aware of what. Exactly some of the issues are, I do feel like we're not necessing this place maybe to talk about it. I know we're talking with the girls, doing the women in tech event for we're kind of like, sharing experiences giving advice.

And at one point we were talking about, do we want to have almost a lecture when we invite men as well or everyone basically to attend to kind of explain because I feel like if they would know what women or just in general? Anyone that's not man or fits the stereotype of a white man and can be a science has to go through.

Maybe they'll be more it'll be more easier for them to emphasise and empathise with everyone else. But then it was kind of like the issue of, Is it your job and duty to use time and resources? Like, obviously, some people like that, right? And I personally like talking about it and talking in past and talking to other people, but it's not necessarily just because you're a woman doesn't need.

You need to talk about an educate, everyone else around you because sometimes you just don't have time exhausting. Sometimes you exhausted. Sometimes you just why do I need to teach you how terrible it is? Just try to like be a bit more aware, so I feel like it's a bit of a double-edged sword in that.

Yeah. That you want to educate people, but sometimes you just don't have time and resources to do it. So yeah. I'm pretty sure universities would sort out though because they're quite good with things like this. And I think employers are wising up to these kinds of things. Exactly. We know we have a diversity problem in, for example, in you know, technology companies exactly.

And they kind of like working towards it. But it takes a long time to make any progress and obviously that comes with the idea of more students need more that I've, in general a variet. She does need to pick up computer science in schools and then universities and then they get to the employee.

So I think it's quite of a slower. A slow advancement? Yeah, same takes years, doesn't it? Yeah. Things to change because cultural thing. Okay, good. So, is there anything else you want to say more about minorities? Oh, I love about it, but I feel like we have we are getting on for time.

So yeah, exactly. Let's move on. Then to there's two things left. So this is one tune one podcast, one film. So we love our music. Yeah. And our films and our podcasts. And Unfortunately, my playlist is dominated by lots of dad rock. So, I've been asking students to well, two things rejuvenated with something a bit different or perhaps internationalise it, you know, because obviously, a lot of the music I listen to is British and American.

Yeah. And, you know, it's kind of fun when people recommend stuff, I would never otherwise have listened to. So one tune that you the special to you for some reason, one podcast. If you, you know, maybe you don't listen to podcasts, but if perhaps some kind of could be a radio programming, let's do and then one film.

Yeah, so I'm gonna try to be brief. It took, it's very difficult. See, it's very difficult. So I want to say, I'm gonna recommend you two tunes because I can't think one. So, the first one is also quite broad. I would recommend you literally anything Harry Styles. I love it, but it's British.

See, that's another thing, but then it's also British so I don't think it's gonna widen your playlist enough. So my next was it was is recently. Oh, I love very good. Yeah, absolutely. You like it then so it's not new Harry Styles. Okay? Absolutely. Adore hairstyles anyway. Quite quite quite.

What's the word? Well dressed He's amazing. I saw him but this is not Harry Styles fan Fan podcast so I have to move on. The next one is one that I used to play during the hard times of exam season. Okay. So it's actually she is, I think yeah, she's Romanian she's a Romanian artist.

Her name is Ina is like double and how do you spell that I and and a i n n a but then the song that I like from high is called iguana iguana. It's in Spanish. Yeah. I think yeah. I actually sinks in Spanish. She's wearing either way. Absolutely amazing.

Bob. I used to listen to it every single time I would sad song or an uplifting song literally uplifting. I don't, I don't even know what she's saying. I don't know. Spanish, it's just it's very funny. Yes. And I used to listen in on the speaker every single morning during exam season because I would be so tired.

And so done, to have to go to the library again, or kill open again. So I just had, I just needed a little bit of joy, my life so that was my morning song. Excellent podcast wise. I really like it's called on being with Krista Tippett Tippett On being Being as in.

Yeah. Just on TV. Yeah. And then Christopher tip, it Krista crystal it's Krista with a k tip. It Okay are ISTA. Yeah, and then tip it is, what doppity? Yeah. How know how do you know is that? I'm just guessing This is such a British thing as well. So yeah, it's a tip, it double P and it's really nice.

She interviews. A lot of people, I think that mostly brightest, but the ones that I like the most. What I think he's called Eileen the boton. All right. Yeah, fluster. Yeah, I really don't know how to cook. Yeah, the lights. Lots of interesting books. This guy, which one? Oh yeah, that one.

Yes, I'm trying to say his name. But yeah, it's an interesting stuff and he does. He does a, is it called school of school of life? I think stuff. Oh yeah, what's one video on YouTube? Sure. I mean he's a philosopher I think by training but he writes, interesting stuff.

Yeah, he was the one that I liked the most and I think that the only ones that she did with him, what about relationships and love and kind of relationship with any kind. And I thought it was so nice and so sweet and absolutely loved it. So I recommend it to every good.

Okay. And then last one is one film. So I to say but that feel like that's very basic. I'm gonna recommend again, too. Just because in case, there's someone that wants to come to uni, right? I would suggest them watching imitation game because I feel like that kind of gives you a really good taste of what's happening and in general with the baby and like the Alan Turing and everything, was that your introduction to some of that history.

And didn't realise all this stuff. I was there. And then I went to Science Museum and I started single things. Oh my god. I was a movie about this. I loved it. I thought was really cool. So I recommend to everyone else, but if you watch there, you can watch call me by a name.

I love call me by myself. I, it's, it's about a gay love story, right? It's adorable. It's in, it's set in Italy, as well. So, it has very much some of vibes because obviously, the weather Manchester is amazing for this, right? So I might, as well pretend lamin Italy.

So, yeah, we've gone from Mediterranean, whether at the beginning of the week. Yeah. 40 degree heat too then, like typical Manchester weather, where it's 15 degrees and raining sideways already. Yeah, I love it. You've got love it, right? So good. So thank you for those recommendations, we'll put them on, we'll put them on the playlist and we'll put them on the show notes that go with this.

So, the last thing is I call this time travel. Yes. So, if you could travel back in time to meet you as a first year, incoming student, what advice would you give yourself Now? You might, it might be advice for yourself, and that might be different from advice. You'd give to other people.

So what you'd advise like how to get the most out of university? I think my personal advice realising now this year, how amazing everyone that I was friends with was I would recommend myself to kind of make a bit more? Obviously it's quite overwhelming, right? First. Yeah, you have a lot of people but I feel like I didn't try to make as many friends that were international in British in first year just because probably I was a bit scared language barrier.

A bit stressful time Romanian. Yeah, I thought I feel like I was trying to stay a bit more Romanians which I think it was very good for me. Especially in the first semester right now. Working very yeah character to come to a different country and then study in a different language that was shocking.

Yeah. But I do feel like all my friendships have been so rewarding and they're having really sweet and actually, my friend. Now third. Yeah, I would make jokes with them because I knew them in firstly, as well. I was just so scared to say hi to them. So it's kind of like, well, good friends.

Now why didn't I not become friends with you first yet? And I think it's an important part of. I mean, we touched a little bit on grades, but I see quite a few students, you know, and it's good if they want to get good grades, but then they miss out on some of that social stuff.

Which, yeah, it's important and I know it's not always used to balance grades and social life, but I think it's an important part. What you're here is to meet people from all over the world and you know, some of those people you're still being touched with 30 years later.

So, I think I think is really good and I feel like Kilburn does that amazingly? Just because obviously it's difficult to balance friends and grades but what is even better is to have friends that you exactly that hope you get your grades. So that's why I've been doing. It's been amazing.

It's been great. Great mix great. Okay. So I think that's that's everything. So, important advice to be bold and please make friends make friends and put yourself out there in throughout university career. So thank you, Alice.
