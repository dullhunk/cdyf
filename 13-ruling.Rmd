# Ruling your future {#ruling}  

In 2005, the scientist and engineer [Phil Bourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Bourne) starting publishing a series of articles which distilled people's hard won knowledge into a series *[Ten Simple Rules](https://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules)*.[@Bourne2005] Over a decade more than 1000 rules were published in over 100 articles in the scientific journal *[PLOS Computational Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_Computational_Biology)*. [@Bourne2018] These articles offer a huge range of advice from making the most of a summer internship [@Aicher2017] to considering life outside academia [@Searls2009] and even (tongue-in-cheek) winning a Nobel Prize. [@Roberts2015] Articles as lists, or “[listicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle)” as they are sometimes known, are a convenient way to summarise key points. So here are Ten Simple Rules for Coding Your Future: the too long, didn't read (TL;DR) for this guidebook.

(ref:captiontensimple) Ten Simple rules for coding your future. Know who you are, look after yourself, use what you have, grow your networks, always make new mistakes, help and thank, look beyond the obvious, stay in school, step outside your comfort zone and (*most importantly*) don't give up!

## Know who you are {#mybrand}

There is a lot more to you than your degree. Yes, you've spent three or four years getting your degree. identify your weaknesses and work out how to improve them.


<!--understand your brand your values, another word for brand is reputation. do people like you. The better you know yourself, the better-->


## Look after yourself {#onlyhuman}
Look after yourself mentally and physically.

Choose your reference points carefully, try not to compare yourself to the person at the top of the class. Ask yourself, am I doing better than last time?


## Use what you have {#gregwilson}

This rule is borrowed from software engineer Greg Wilson [\@gvwilson](https://github.com/gvwilson), who probably adapted it from a quote frequently misattributed to President Theodore Roosevelt [@teddy]. The full quote is  

> Start where you are, use what you have, help who you can, see https://third-bit.com


<!--What is the next step?

if i had a better, different degree from a better different university?

if i had more experiences, more voluntary work, more internships

If i'd done more extra-curricular activities-->

## Build your network {#network}

Build your network, use all the people you can. Remember that the weaker ties in your network may be more important than your stronger ties, especially when it comes to finding jobs.

It's not what you know, its who you know.

## Always make new mistakes {#estherdyson}

You can classify your mistakes and failures into two categories:

1. Productive mistakes: those you learnt from
1. Unproductive mistakes: those you didn't learn anything from and risk repeating


Mistakes and failure are inevitable in life, but productive mistakes are going to help you much more that unproductive ones [@henrypetroski]. That doesn't just mean  you should “fail fast, fail often” [@failfast] or “move fast and break things”, but to conciously learn from any mistakes you make so that you don't repeat them.  One way to turn unproductive mistakes into productive ones is deliberately and conciously reflect on why you made them. This is part of the growth mindset we discussed in the chapter on [your well-being](#wellbeing).

In a growth mindset, mistakes can be good, but the fear of making them is not. You are more likely to take more chances when you're unafraid to fail, and this will improve your chances of success.

Many education systems around the world don't teach people how to fail, because they put too much emphasis on success (top grades) rather than progress and learning. [@failgift] So as Ester Dyson says,

Always make new mistakes

* If you've got some harsh feedback on your CV, how can you make less buggy in the future?
* If you've applied to lots of companies and not even had a reply yet, how you improve your job search strategy?
* If you've neglected to develop interests and projects outside of work, how can you rebalance?
* If you crashed and burned in an interview, how can you use the experience to do better next time?
* If you failed to get the promotion you thought you deserved, what will you do differently in the future


## Help and thank who you can {#gratitude}

There are good reasons to be grateful, showing gratitude doesn't just help other people, it helps you too.

Join a team by helping someone, be a team player, help others, thank others for their help.


## Look beyond the obvious {#beyond}

Be flexible in approach. Not just big employers, there are startups, SME's you've never heard of. It's not just London, and other big cities. Look beyond graduate schemes, look beyond graduate jobs.

You are not just a techie, Either.

## Stay in school {#lifelonglearning}

Never stop learning.


## Step outside your comfort zone {#comfy}

Am I being insensitive asking people to step outside their comfort zone when we've all be stretched beyond breaking point during COVID-19?

We're going to need to continue to step outside of our respective comfort zones in order to meet the challenges we face around the world.

This takes courage, but that's often when you learn most. So step outside your comfort zone if you're feeling brave enough to learn.

<!--You need to be courageous to live a regret-free life but the alternative is to die full of regret. bronnie ware-->

## Don't give up {#nevergiveup}

<!--APPLY, bouncing back. It's tempting to shutdown and give up. Don't be tempted, reboot, regroup, reflect and keep going.-->

Learn to live with rejection, don't take it personally

<!--Don't give up learning either, stay in school. Science and engineering are fast moving fields with constant change. While your degree has hopefully armed you with a range of fundamental generic skills that will last your lifetime, you will constantly need to learn new things.-->

## Ten simple summaries {#tldr13}

This chapter is under construction, but hopefully you can get the general gist of what's going on.
