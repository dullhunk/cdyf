# Reading your future
<!-- was References -->
If you want to have your future read, I recommend you ignore [Tarot cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot), [crystal balls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_ball), and other psychic nonsense from shady [snake oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil) salespeople. You can read your future in books, journals, websites, magazines and anywhere else you find the written word.

So get reading your future now. Reading is good for your soul too.

This chapter lists everything (and I mean *everything*) cited in this book. For a more easily digestible version see the signposts section of any chapter in this book.
