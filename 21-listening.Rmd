# Hearing your future {#hearing}

*Hearing your Future* is the Coding your Future podcast which accompanies this guidebook. We talk to graduands and graduates of computer science to hear more about their journey from student to professional. What happens after graduation like the one shown in figure \@ref(fig:graduation-fig)? What comes next?

```{r graduation-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongraduation)"}

```

(ref:captiongraduation) Silly hat? ‚úÖ Silly frock? ‚úÖ Wearing your best outfit? ‚úÖ It must be time for graduation! What comes next? *Hearing your future* interviews current and former students to find out more about how they got to where they are and where they are going to next. Picture of obligatory hat throwing outside the [Samuel Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alexander) building in 2018.

Listen in to the episodes below, or read the transcripts, to find out more about how these students are coding their future:

* What's their story?  
* How did they get to where they are?
* What obstacles have they faced and how did they overcome them?
* Where are they planning to going next?
* What advice would they offer to their former selves and fellow students?

## Episode $x$: it could be YOU! {#you}
YOUR FUTURE WANTS YOU: Join your future! If you'd like to be interviewed for the show, [get in touch](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact), see figure \@ref(fig:yfnu-fig). Besides interviewing current graduates, I'm interested in speaking to former graduates, especially if you:

* completed a placement or internship(s) as an undergraduate or postgraduate
* consider yourself to be part of a minority or under-represented group

I'm also interested in speaking to people who graduated a while back, not just this years graduates, but any back to 1968. üéì [@babygrowsup]

```{r yfnu-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "33%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionyfnu)"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/your-future-wants-you.jpeg", 3))
```

(ref:captionyfnu) Your ~~country~~ future wants YOU. ü´µ Join your future. If you are a former student of Computer Science who'd like to appear on the show, [get in touch](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact). I'm especially interested to hear from students who did internships or placements before they graduated in Computer Science. Picture adapted from an original public domain image of the [Lord Kitchener Wants You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kitchener_Wants_You) poster by [Alfred Leete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Leete) on Wikimedia Commons at [w.wiki/3xvX](https://w.wiki/3xvX)

If you're preparing to come on the show, please have a think about the following questions:

### What's your story, coding glory? {#your-story}
With apologies to the Noel Gallagher and Liam Gallagher, see figure \@ref(fig:gallagher2-fig):

> ‚ÄúAll your dreams are made, when you're chained to [the tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue-tracking_systems) and the software trade...
> What's your story, coding glory?‚Äù

What's your story?

* What's your name and where do you come from? [@blinddate]
* Why did you choose to study computer science?
* Which organisation were you employed by, why and how did you choose them
* What were the main obstacles you faced finding employment and how did you overcome them?
* Tell us about your roles and responsibilities within the organisation
* How did you find the job and what other jobs did they look for?
* What were the main things you learned on placement?
* What was the most enjoyable or rewarding part of working for your employer?
* What did you do for your final year project?
* What comes next?

```{r gallagher2-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:caption2gallagher)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/whats-the-story.jpeg")
```

### Minority report {#minority}
This is an optional question taken from the title of the [Philip K. Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick) novel *[The Minority Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minority_Report)* and subsequent film adaptation, see figure \@ref(fig:minority-fig). Minority report asks our guests:

* Do you consider yourself to be a member of an under-represented, minority or otherwise marginalised group?
* If so which one(s) are you happy to discuss, see section \@ref(protected) and \@ref(genderid)?
* What has your experience been of being in a minority at University and in the workplace?
* How can the teaching and learning of computer science be made more [equitable, diverse and inclusive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion) for members of your minority group(s)?
* What else can universities do to make campuses more welcoming to members of your minority group(s)?
* What more can employers do to make workplaces more welcoming to members of your minority group(s)?

```{r minority-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionminority)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/minority-report.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionminority) Are you in a minority?  Inspired by the book [@theminorityreport] and its film adaptation [@minorityreport], we'll hear from some of our minorities. *The Minority Report* is short story by Philip K. Dick first published by *[Fantastic Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Universe)* magazine in 1956. What is it like being in minority and how could universities and employers be more welcoming to your minority group(s)?

### One tune, one podcast and one film {#otopof}

We love our music, films and podcasts and make gratuitous references to them throughout *Coding your Future*. Critics say our playlist in chapter \@ref(enjoying) is clogged up with:

* Lancashire boy bands, see section \@ref(lancashire)
* [DadRock](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dad-Rock/dp/B09F6GQSKK) and [BritPop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britpop), see section \@ref(dadrock)
* cardigan-swinging, [shoe-gazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze), [glastonbury-going](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival) [indie music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock), see section \@ref(indie)
* music made with digital computers rather than analogue instruments, see section  \@ref(electronica)
* other antiquities from a bygone era [@dadrock2]

So, can you recommend a:

* **TUNE!** One tune to rejuvenate or internationlise up our playlists. Why is it important to you?
    - Perhaps it makes you relax, feel happy or comforted?
    - Maybe it reminds you of special people, a special time or special place in your life?
    - We'll add it to *The Coder's Playlist* in section \@ref(coders)
* **PODCAST:** One podcast (or audiobook) you‚Äôve enjoyed that you‚Äôd recommend people listen or subscribe to üéß
* **FILM:** One film we‚Äôve got to go and watch right now, old or new üçø

### Time traveller {#your-time}

Do you wish that you knew what you know now, when you were younger? Just like [Ronnie Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Lane), [Ronnie Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Wood) and [Rod Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Stewart), we all probably feel that way sometimes, see figure \@ref(fig:faces2-fig). So, if you could travel back in time to meet the younger you, just starting University:

* What would you tell your former self, now that you are older and wiser?
* What would you tell current students to help them get the most of their preciously short time at University?

```{r faces2-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfaces2)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/faces.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionfaces2) Poor old grandad I laughed at all his words but I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger, see [Ooh La La](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_La_La_(Faces_song)). [@faces] Do you wish that you knew what you know now, when you were younger? What would you tell your younger self about getting the most from University life?

## Everything I had to know, I heard it on my radio {#radio}
We'll leave the last words on podcasting to *[The Buggles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buggles)* and *[Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band))*. Podcasting is an evolution and mutation of radio but did video kill the radio star? [@videokilled] What if everything you had to know, you could hear it on your radio, see figure \@ref(fig:gaga-fig)? Tune in to find out. üìª

```{r gaga-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongaga)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Everything-I-had-to-know-I-heard-it-on-my-radio.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiongaga) All we hear is [Radio Ga Ga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Ga_Ga) but everything I had to know, I heard it on my radio. [@radiogaga]  

### Thanks Jez {#jez}
