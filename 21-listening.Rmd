# Hearing your future {#hearing}

*Hearing your Future* is the Coding your Future podcast where we talk to current and former students of computer science to hear more about their journey from student to professional. What happens after graduation like the one shown in figure \@ref(fig:graduation-fig)? What comes next?

```{r graduation-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongraduation)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/graduation2.jpeg")
```

## Episode x: it could be you! {#you}
If you'd like to be interviewed for the show, get in touch, see figure \@ref(fig:yfnu-fig). You're future needs you! Besides interviewing current graduates, I'm interested in speaking to former graduates, especially those that did placements or internships as undergraduate or postgraduate students.

```{r yfnu-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "32%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionyfnu)"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/your-future-wants-you.jpeg", 3))
```

(ref:captionyfnu) Your ~~country~~ future needs you! If you're a former student of Computer Science who'd like to appear on the show, [get in touch](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact). I'm especially interested to hear from students who did internships or placements during their undergraduate degree in Computer Science, not just those from the University of Manchester. Picture adapted from an original public domain image of the [Lord Kitchener Wants You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kitchener_Wants_You) poster by A. Erhardt on Wikimedia Commons at [w.wiki/3xvX](https://w.wiki/3xvX)

If you're preparing to come on the show, please have a think about the following questions:

### What's your story, coding glory? {#wyscg}
* Tell us a bit about you and where you come from
* Why did you choose to study computer science?
* Which organisation were you employed by, why and how did you choose them
* Tell us about your role in the organisation
* How did you find the job and what other jobs did they look for?
* What were the main things you learned on placement?
* What was the most enjoyable or rewarding part of working for your employer?
* What was the main obstacles you faced finding employment and how did you overcome them?
* What did you do for your final year project?
* What comes next?

### Minority report {#minority}
* If you are a member of a minority group, what has your experience been at University and in the workplace
* How can teaching be made more inclusive for members of your minority group?
* What else can universities (and employers) do to make campuses (and workplaces) more welcoming for members of your minority group?

### One tune, one podcast and one film {#otopof}

There are far too many gratuitous musical references in *Coding your Future* itâ€™s mostly [DadRock](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a29419783/what-is-dad-rock/) and other antique pieces. [@dadrock] So can you recommend us:

* One tune to rejuvenate and freshen up our playlist. Why is it important to you? Perhaps itâ€™s a tune that makes you relax, feel happy, comforted, reminds you of home, family, friends etc
* One podcast youâ€™ve enjoyed to that youâ€™d recommend our listeners subscribe to
* One film weâ€™ve got to go and watch right now

### Time travel
* Advice to your former self, what would you tell yourself in first and second year now that you are older and wiser?
