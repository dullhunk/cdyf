# Ruling your future {#ruling}  

In 2005, the scientist and engineer [Phil Bourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Bourne) starting publishing a series of articles which distilled people's hard won knowledge into *[Ten Simple Rules](https://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules)*. [@Bourne2005] Over a decade more than 1000 rules were published in over 100 articles in the scientific journal *[PLOS Computational Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_Computational_Biology)*. [@Bourne2018] These articles offer a huge range of advice from making the most of a summer internship [@Aicher2017] to teaching programming [@tensimplebrown] and even winning a Nobel Prize. [@Roberts2015] Articles as lists, or “[listicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle)” as they are sometimes known, are a convenient way to summarise key points. So here are *Ten Simple Rules for Coding Your Future*: the too long, didn't read ([TL;DR](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read)) summary of this guidebook.

```{r ten-simple-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiontensimple)"}

(ref:captiontensimple) Ten Simple rules for coding your future. Know who you are, look after yourself, use what you have, grow your networks, always make new mistakes, help and thank, look beyond the obvious, stay in school, step outside your comfort zone and (*most importantly*) don't give up!

## Know who you are {#mybrand}

There is a lot more to you than your degree. Yes, you've spent (or will be spending) three or four years getting your degree. Use this time to identify your weaknesses and work out how to improve them. Knowing your future depends on knowing who you are now, see chapter \@ref(knowing) and figure \@ref(fig:knowing-fig).

```{r knowing-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionknowmyself)"}

<!--understand your brand your values, another word for brand is reputation. do people like you. The better you know yourself, the better-->


## Look after yourself {#onlyhuman}
Look after yourself mentally and physically. Studying at University can be enjoyable but it can also make you stressed, anxious and depressed. Choose your reference points carefully, try not to compare yourself to the person at the top of the class. Ask yourself, am I doing better than last time? Be kind to yourself because nurturing yourself now will nurture your future, see chapter \@ref(nurturing).

```{r lookafter-again-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionlookafteragain)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Look after yourself.png")
```

## Use what you have {#gregwilson}

It's too easy to fall into a trap of thikning *if I had...* when job hunting. Use what you already have, see figure \@ref(fig:usewhatyouhave-fig).

```{r usewhatyouhave-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionusewhatyouhave)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Use what you have.png")
```

This rule is borrowed from software engineer Greg Wilson [\@gvwilson](https://github.com/gvwilson) in figure \@ref(fig:greg-wilson-fig), who probably adapted it from a quote frequently misattributed to Theodore Roosevelt [@teddy].

```{r greg-wilson-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongregwilson)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/greg-wilson-software-carpentry.jpeg")
```

When you're job hunting, it can be competitive and cut-throat. You can sometimes fall into poor habits of mind:

* “*If I had a better degree from a different university, I'd be more successful...*” see section \@ref(entitled)
* “*If I had more experience, more voluntary work, more internships, I'd stand a better chance...*” see section \@ref(areuexperienced)
* “*If I'd done more projects and extra-curricular activities...*” etc see section \@ref(mycvpj)
* “*If I'd got better grades at school and Uni...*” see section \@ref(academentia)
* “*If only I'd worked harder...*” see \@ref(regret)
* “*If I was more confident at speaking and interviews ... *” see chapter \@ref(speaking) on *Speaking your future*
* “*If I'd been to a different school, I could be more successful...*” see the [93percent.club](https://www.93percent.club/) [@93bbc; @93guardian]

Coulda. Woulda. Shoulda. This is all the usual dialogue you can expect from your inner critic. Acknowledge these thoughts, see section \@ref(lays), then try distance yourself from them. Start from where you are, use whatever you have and help who you can.

## Build your networks {#networking}

Build your networks, make use of all the people you can, because people can help you, see figure \@ref(fig:yournetwork-fig)

```{r yournetwork-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionyournetwork)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Grow your networks.png")
```
(ref:captionyournetwork) Grow and use your network, both the strong ties and the weak ties described in section \@ref(weakties). Grow your network by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Remember that the weaker ties in your network (see section \@ref(weakties)) may be more important than your stronger ties, especially when it comes to finding jobs.

```{r allpeople-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionallaboutpeople)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/its-all-about-people-2.png")
```

(ref:captionallaboutpeople) Your network can help you before, during and after your employment, so be sure to grow your network when you can. This includes both the stronger ties of trusted friends alongside the weaker ties too, described in section \@ref(weakties). Both are important.

[It's not (just) what you know, but *who* you know](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it%27s_not_what_you_know_but_who_you_know).

## Always make new mistakes {#estherdyson}

You can classify your mistakes and failures into two categories:

1. Productive mistakes: those you learnt from
1. Unproductive mistakes: those you didn't learn anything from (and risk repeating)

Mistakes and failure are inevitable in life, but productive mistakes are going to help you much more that unproductive ones [@henrypetroski]. That doesn't just mean  you should “*fail fast, fail often*” [@failfast] or “*move fast and break things*”, but to conciously learn from any mistakes you make so that you don't repeat them.  One way to turn unproductive mistakes into productive ones is deliberately and conciously reflect on why you made them. This is part of the growth mindset we discussed in chapter \@ref(nurturing).

In a growth mindset, mistakes can be good, but the fear of making them is not. You are more likely to take more chances when you're unafraid to fail, and this will improve your chances of success.

Many education systems around the world don't teach people how to fail, because they put too much emphasis on success (as measured by grades) rather than progress and learning. [@failgift] So as the angel investor [Esther Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson) once said, “Always make new mistakes”, see figure \@ref(fig:esther-dyson-fig)

```{r esther-dyson-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionestherdyson)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/esther-dyson-always-make-new-mistakes.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionestherdyson) Mistakes are inevitable in life, so there's no shame in making them especially if they are new. Making *new* mistakes can be a form of productive failure that you learn from rather than a source of unproductive failure that you repeat (old mistakes). Portrait of [Esther Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson) by Christopher Michel (CC BY-SA) via Wikimedia commons [w.wiki/3TEY](https://w.wiki/3TEY) adapted using the [Wikipedia App](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238).

So:

* If you've got some harsh feedback on your CV, how can you make less buggy in the future?
* If you've applied to lots of companies and not even had a reply yet, how you improve your job search strategy?
* If you've neglected to develop interests and projects outside of work, how can you rebalance?
* If you crashed and burned in an interview, how can you use the experience to do better next time?
* If you failed to get the promotion you thought you deserved, what will you do differently in the future


## Help and thank who you can {#gratitude}

There are good reasons to be grateful, showing gratitude doesn't just help other people, it helps you too see figure \@ref(fig:helpandthank-fig)

```{r helpandthank-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionhelp)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Help and Thank.png")
```
(ref:captionhelp) Help and thank who you can. Help by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Join a team by helping someone, be a team player, help others, thank others for their help.


## Look beyond the obvious {#beyond}

Be flexible in approach. Not just big employers, there are startups, SME's you've never heard of. It's not just London (see chapter \@ref(moving)), and other big cities. Look beyond graduate schemes, look beyond graduate jobs. Broaden your horizons and your job search, see chapter \@ref(broadening).

You are not just a techie, Either.

## Stay in school {#lifelonglearning}

Part of what you learn during your education is *how* to learn. But your learning shouldn't finish when you leave University. Computer science is a young and rapidly changing discipline which means you can not afford to be left behind. Never stop learning, see chapter \@ref(achieving).


## Step outside your comfort zone {#comfy}

Am I being insensitive asking people to step outside their comfort zone when we've all be stretched beyond breaking point during COVID-19?

We're going to need to continue to step outside of our respective comfort zones in order to meet the challenges we face around the world.

This takes courage, but that's often when you learn most. So step outside your comfort zone if you're feeling brave enough to learn.

<!--You need to be courageous to live a regret-free life but the alternative is to die full of regret. bronnie ware-->

## Don't give up {#nevergiveup}

<!--APPLY, bouncing back. It's tempting to shutdown and give up. Don't be tempted, reboot, regroup, reflect and keep going.-->

Job hunting is hard. Job hunting is stressful. Job hunting is time consuming. Some employers will waste your valuable time, see section \@ref(timesink). Some employers will reject you but try not to take it personally, see \@ref(rejection). Job hunting may affect your mental health, see chapter \@ref(nurturing). The important thing is to not give up, see figure \@ref(fig:katebush-fig). Try to make any failure productive, rather than unproductive, see section \@ref(estherdyson).

```{r katebush-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionkatebush)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dont-give-up-bush-gabriel.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionkatebush) You were taught to fight, taught to win, perhaps you never thought you could fail? Don't give up, because you have friends. Don't give up, you're not beaten yet. Don't give up, I know you can make it good.

[@dontgiveup]


<!--Don't give up learning either, stay in school. Science and engineering are fast moving fields with constant change. While your degree has hopefully armed you with a range of fundamental generic skills that will last your lifetime, you will constantly need to learn new things.-->
