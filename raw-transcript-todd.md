Welcome Todd, thank you for coming on hearing your future. Could you start by saying a little bit about who you are? Yeah. How are you came to be here today? 

> Thank you so much for having me. It's great to be on the podcast. So my name is Todd Davis. I was here back in 2013, originallyto do my bachelor's degree and I'm back here for the open day tomorrow. Manchester where I, I'll be speaking in the engineering faculty. And and also, of course, to visit the friends that I have. So Manchester I'm always looking for reasons to come back excuses. Yeah, yeah. Um, so it's always nice to be back.

> Good, well, welcome back. Welcome back to Manchester. Um, So in terms of let's go back right back to the beginning. So um, Can you remember you obviously chose to study computer science? Um, can you remember what it was that switched you on to that subject as a possibility when you're in primary or high school?

I think it was a bunch of things. Um, my earliest memory of kind of being interested in computers, was in primary school. When I saw the I.T technician in the school typing in the master, password, into one of the computers and I ducively watched what key she pressed and then told her oh, the password is such and such and I thought she was going to be quite pleased with me. I think when I was, you know, five or six or however, older, I was, and she was actually not very pleased with me. She, she then had to go and change the password and all the different computers. Um, and I think perhaps it was this. Um, but also, when I was growing up kind of You having internet, we weren't not having a computer at all to having a computer. So this kind of came in as I was kind of also coming of age if I was growing up. So, um, I was something that was quite naturally drawn to, um, And I remember, uh, going going to high school and just always being interested and kind of trying to play with the computers and then subsequently getting in trouble for inverting almost hacking them.

> Penetration testing? 

Yeah, I mean that that would be how I would phrase it. That's not entirely how the school understood it. Um and then I guess a combination of the schools uh encouragement uh in my parents encouragement, to kind of take this in a slightly more productive direction.

Um saw me programming, right? Um, and to be honest, I I lived in, in a, in a place that was quite far from where a lot of my school friends would live, right? So, in the evenings on the weekends, I would have a lot of time with me and my siblings, and there's only so much time you can spend with your brother and sister really.

So I ended up, you know, at the computer programming, quite quite a lot. Um, and was it was it a social thing as well? Were you, were you socialising with your friends online at that time? Yeah, surprisingly. So so I have two big memories of this. The first um, was it was like in Internet form dates, right?

So there were like forums

Stuff. Um I was like always trying to make my own encryption algorithms which were inevitably like an absolutely disaster. Um, Yeah, right. Yeah. This kind of stuff. Um, and and then also, I had a friend who was in the U.S, um, and he was, uh, he was making apps and things and websites all the time.

So he would be making a website. I will be making the companion Android app for that website, quite often. So we we made a passive manager together. We made a homework tracking app together, right? Um, and that was the first time I got paid to do programming. Um, Kind of, you know, cross Atlantic collaboration with someone who I'd never met which, which was was quite good.

I also made, I remember making, uh, an Android app called Push-up partner. When I was there, when I was a kid and basically, you would put it on the smartphone, you would put the smartphone on the floor and then, as you would do a push-up, you would touch the smartphone with your notes and it would count how many you've done.

Uh, okay, yeah. So I was really like, you know, there's an app for that, that was my coming of age. Uh, You was it a subject that you studied at GCSE or animal? Or was it something? So, where you were just doing this on the side, basically? Yeah. Actively.

Yeah. So was it on off or at your school? Or was it something that you decided not to do because you could teach it yourself? Yeah. I I think I wasn't really pushed in this direction at all my bicycle. Um, I originally wanted to become a doctor actually and I, I found chemistry extremely hard.

Which which kind of, um, made me think twice about becoming a doctor. And then this idea of transitioning into or doing more Computing stuff became more interesting. And at school at high school, there was no like Computing course. Um, and I I honestly, I really didn't like maths. I distinctly remember getting uh, was it 14 in the last test at school and then, you know, even though I got 14, I knew 14 wasn't very high.

Um, so so I was all to try really hard for the next exam and then proceeded to get 12 on this, on subsequent test. So, math was something was really difficult for me at school and and because of that I was also worried about whether I could be successful as as a as a computer scientist as well.

So I was like looking at the the maths grade to get in. So I had to really um, bust a gut in my, in my, a levels to, to get the grades to come to Manchester right in the day. But yeah, there was there was no um, computer Computing, a levels offered at all right.

Which isn't unusual? I mean, it's a, it is a kind of a bit of a minority subject in law schools anyway and honestly I'm I think it's okay. I think having a foundation in the math. Yeah, maths is important.

Seems. Yeah. Just over 10 years ago. Yeah. Um, to study computer science. So can we talk about your journey through the degree? So, you're right here in first year was um, What was it like getting to grips for the subject at University having not studied it, other than Right.

There's a sideline. It was strange because I distinctly had this feeling that some things I knew quite well, because I'd already been doing programming for a while and other things I didn't know at all. Um, and it was this kind of quite a funny dichotomy in that sense where simultaneously I felt quite, you know, confident and very underconfident so especially with some of the maths.

Um, so there was like, more kind of decision maths and logic that I had never seen before, um, outside of a few books that maybe we can come to later. Um, but then like the introduction to programming courses. I was really quite comfortable with. Yeah. Um, which is good because, um, I think the parts why I was feeling more comfortable comfortable that gave me confidence, to be able to like, you know, be keep keep going with some of the tougher things, I think if it was all like, very, very theoretical kind of mathematical applied maths, and then it would have been more challenging.

And, to be honest, some of my favourite courses later on, in the degree, ended up

You did an internship at the end of your first year and talk us about how you went about getting that. Um, I think you actually did internships in high school as well. Yeah. So where you come, this, you're already on the ball when you got here. So, uh, how how did that all happen?

Yeah, well, I think, on the ball, there's a bit of a, there's a bit of a generous phrasing, actually. I think what actually happened is that my parents were pushing me to get a summer job, right? And the thought of waiting, yeah, the thought of like waiting on or something was a bit scary.

So, I was always thinking like well how can I not do that? Those two like web development companies, they were my parents lived and who were nice enough to take me on as this like 16 year old kid who, you know, yeah, claimed that he could write websites. So when he actually couldn't really write websites very well at all.

And so I had done two different kind of web development internships over this. I guess that probably helped a little bit in that your CV was Be a little bit stronger than perhaps a lot of undergraduates. So I speak to lots of students where they say, I don't have any experience and that is okay.

You know, a lot of people are in that situation, but you're in a, perhaps a bit of a stronger situation because you had these projects on your CV that set you apart from your competitors. Yeah, I think it also help. Help. Give me a little bit again of confidence.

So so we had these careers days at Manchester where lots of different companies would come in and they would, they would all set up stores, maybe go and talk to them. And that's how he got my first, like, real inversity Commerce internship at Morgan Stanley. This investment Bank in London and I remember going in talking to them and I I knew what I was signing up for that, I knew like what it was like to go and have an internship and

That was like, the next step because I've already done one of those steps if you like. Yeah, so I think having done it before gave me a little bit of confidence to kind of do it again, but a little bit better that time, if that makes it more of the same but bigger.

And yeah, better paid hopefully yeah. And perhaps, Is a huge organisation, so there's kind of a massive. Yeah, yeah, I have to say. So I went to Morgan Stanley, it would have been in the summer of 2014, I think, and it was really tough. Um, so basically, they had me in London, in Canary Wharf, I was wearing a suit I was turning up.

I distinctly remember as a kid, I would watch the television like join the financial crisis and they would have these all the people on walking across London Bridge. Well, not London Bridge. They had the specific shot of Canary War fight next to the tube session. You have these, like, clocks every time.

There's a big Financial issue. You know, this was the shot, they would use and I would kind of walk past that on my way into the banking, as kind of quite surreal for me, is this, you know, 19. So maybe I was even 18 when I first started. No, I can't.

Get 18. I must be 19. Um, maybe anyway, but like, is this very young? Yeah, student and going into this big office and feeling like I was at this kind of somehow the nerve centre of

Thankfully kind of similar to Java in a sense. Um, it runs on the same virtual machine. If, if functional programming at this point exactly the first exposure to underneath, right? So I'd read I'd read. Um, what's it called? The little schema, which is this, this book about lisp, um, which gave me a very theoretical and Incredibly impractical understanding of functional program is and I get to, you know, Morgan's only where they have this, you know, Enterprise level Scholars stack and I'm absolutely 100 over my head, you know, I don't know what's going on and that was that was honestly quite tough.

It was it was quite formative for me to be under that pressure. Um, and also little things like wearing a suit, you know. I I wore the student in school so it wasn't unusual but somehow like being in an office. Yeah. Like with the big big office it was really scary.

And did you have to wear a suit? Because I guess in Pro programmers in Banks. Don't always wear suits. Yeah, I don't know if that's still the same but back then people were

Because you must have had good support from your team, the people around you to explain, you know, the stuff that you weren't you're struggling with. So you had good support I guess. What so what happened coming back to University? Then you were what happened through your seconds were now into second year.

You're then looking at doing another summer internship again the next summer or were you and you know you didn't do a placement but you were thinking again or about applying for other stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, so despite it being difficult amongst somebody didn't put me off. I I I really enjoyed it.

It's good to be clear like and I think in general, I'm not someone who shies away from difficulties and this was probably why it was enjoyable, right? Because they're giving you proper work to do. That is important and consequential. It's not just thing that never sees the light of day you're actually working on software that's being used by.

Yeah. Hundreds thousands of users potentially so you've kind of got to get it right? Yeah. Right. Um and so I came back in second year and already I had this idea like what's next like you know what is, what am I gonna do the next summer? Um, you know, probably I should have been also thinking about.

What am I going to do in the courses? I'm taking that year. Um,

With what the current students are thinking to be honest. Um, maybe there's a stronger focus on AI these days. I'm not sure. I think big Tech's always going to be a draw, just because the brand. Yeah, is pulls people in, doesn't it? Yeah. And it's well known. Yeah, and it's often what People think of when they think of computer science they think of Google or yeah.

And that was 100 the case for me. So as I was saying before I was building these Android apps when I was when I was young and I would literally um, it would be Google. I O which is Google's like big flagship conference every year and I wouldn't know the software Engineers who would go on stage and enhance stuff.

Them every year, the same people. And this is a huge thing for me. So, like, I really, it wasn't just big Tech. It wasn't Facebook. I was kidding or Microsoft I was going to hackathons and stuff that that they were putting on, but I wanted to go to Google.

Uh, that was why I really wanted to go. So I applied uh, for an internship there. And Yeah they Google only do summer internships, don't they say they don't there's no such thing as a year as far as I know. A lot of these big American companies, don't offer these I think occasionally there are slightly different rules that are one year long, but not for a software engineering internship.

But I mean, they're also changing quite often. So I'm not sure most students have managed to negotiate placements but it never seems to be some something sort of under the counter. If you ask the right person at the right time, but I think there's often a lot of flexibility for for things like this.

You have to when you get your foot in the door, you can get off. Leverage. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, yeah.

So can you talk us through like how applying to Google was in your second year? I mean, you you then obviously quite rigorous selection process. How did you handle all of that? Yeah. So We don't know, Morgan sunglers as well, not to just not to say that that was easy, but, um, you kind of guess you've got some experience of that from doing moment standing, but how was your?

Yeah, yeah, I think that the previous internships were vital to help prepare me for the Google one as well. Um, and the monsani selection process to be, to be like, it was very rigorous. I mean, I went down to London, I had a full day of interviews. Yeah. So and it was tough and it was also a lot of fun.

Uh, It's it's a lot less so you do two or I did two online interviews that were 45 minutes each and I think you remember telling me a horror story about this. It was just about you having to write code in Google in in Google Docs and it had to compile.

Yeah, basically. Yeah. So that you don't even have an idea. Yeah. Yeah. You don't get any help from your editor. You just literally have to type in Google Docs and so later on, spoiler of that I went to Google and I was doing the, the interviews. Um, I was the interviewer sometimes and you as the interfere you you're quite generous to candidates, you know, if you can't remember the name of some obscure API call, it's fine, you know, like it's something you can look up, it's not the end of the world but at the same time as the candidate, you know, you want to write code, you don't want to make those mistakes, you know, you want to try and show Mastery of.

Yeah, the way that this works as much as possible. So you know, I was while I was doing my second year in Manchester, I was also, you know practising a lot of coding interviews uh and and also practising.

Early braces are for whatever it is but honestly, I'm not sure if it really helps that much, I think it probably makes you feel a bit more at home when you're writing it in that kind of editor. But I think, fundamentally like, you either, If you're gonna do well, you're gonna do well, regardless of the avatar.

Um, yeah, probably. So, I mean, were you using things like things like lead code and hacker rank exist by and I guess hacker rank would have done. But yeah, I think they're both existing. Were you using those or were you? Yeah, right. Yeah, I would I would basically like mine the internet for right for different different, coding questions and go them out, but but also just reviewing the basic algorithms.

So like I wanted to be able to, you know, a lot of the, the mainstream ones, just code them without without having to make mistakes or without having to go back and refer to it so quick sort and merge saw Etc, those kinds of things. So I'd write them in Google Docs and I would copy paste them into the editor and then compile it, and if it would compile first time, and if it would work without books, that I'd be like, good.

That's all I want to do in interview. So I did a lot of preps, long story short, for those interviews, right? Um, and yeah, bye. I guess a combination of

Talk about what you were doing at Google or was it? Yeah, yeah, I can. Yeah, well, I think the first thing to mention which was like quite a shock to me was that you apply for, at least back then you applied for Europe. Um, so you applied to all of the offices simultaneously in Europe and I in my head was going to go to the London office.

And while they actually offered me was a place in Munich A huge thing because I had never to speak German well. Now, I do again spoil all that, um, although it's not very fluent but you didn't know, but I didn't then and I never left the UK, exactly once to go to Florida, which is not entirely, you know, Worlds Apart, culturally speaking.

So, I remember Landing in Germany and being absolutely like, a rabbit in a headlight, so I had no idea what was going on. I had no idea where to go, how to use the the underground there. Etc, etc. Yeah. So this is a huge transition for me. And to answer your question, though.

What was I doing? Um, so back then I was working in the families team. So, essentially, that team was part of the Google accounts team. Right? So, you know, most a lot of people have Google accounts and that team managers, um, kind of that construct within within Google's. Yeah system.

Accounts and that child's account. All right. Okay, so it's our family link family, link? Yes, yeah, yeah. So I spend a lot of time doing family link things, um, which obviously intersects a lot with regulation. Yeah. And and privacy and security and also ethics as well. Yeah. So it was quite an interesting area to work in.

Um, although as an intern, you know, mostly you get a project, uh, and and you're quite far removed from these kind of more exciting discussions. Uh, but the project is exciting enough. Yeah. Quite a lot. So That's your some, at the end of your second year, you're now into final year.

So can you talk us through? I think you said earlier, you proposed your own project and so it's a little bit about what your third year project was. Yeah, yeah. So I my my first year project was one. I came up with mainly because I had this this, uh, Always been interested in parallelism which is you know taking some Computing task and trying to do it more quickly by running it on more cores at once.

So having multiple questions. Yeah. Um, so back then there was this kind of Rise of GPU Computing. So, you know, usually software runs on the CPU and which nowadays might have quite a lot of cores, but back then, you know, maybe we'll have two or four calls. Having these days, they have a humongous number of calls back then, I think you were thinking like, maybe 500 cores, right?

For a good one. I think the machine I had had like 90 or 128 or something like that, but basically like the long story show is they have a lot more parallel processing cases. Yeah. CPU. So my project was to try and speed up a text mining pipeline. So a pipeline that would ingest large amounts of text and kind of extract insights from them.

Part of that pipeline, which was the part of speech tagger. So, looking at every word and saying, is this a noun? Is this a verb? Etc, which sounds like an easy task, but there's a lot of edge cases, which make it a bit more difficult and running that not on the, on the CPU, um, but trying to paralyse it and running it on GPU where it could be faster, right?

And it worked. Um, it worked well enough to for the project, um, Yeah, so I guess it's kind of fun on me because kind of I'm quite open-ended project where you kind of just follow your nose basically and find find an interesting problem and try and solve it as best you can.

Yeah. And I have to say maybe like that was my very first introduction to research ethink, right? Yeah. So, I was reading papers trying to engage with the literature a little bit, um, and yeah, by coming up with a problem and trying to trying to solve it not knowing whether it was actually going to work out.

But doing the research regardless, I think that Sergio project, quite a big transition, for a lot of people because whereas, you you've gone from To then maths as well I suppose. But then to the the the big output of the third year project isn't just the software. It's the actual written report that which is describing the problem you've solved but also why that problem is important than how other people have tried to solve that same problem.

So, um, I know some people, some people struggle with this more than others, but how did you find the sort of process of Writing a big, long report, which is probably the first big long report that you've done. Actually. Yeah. So I, I did this really unusual thing in my undergrad where I produce these notes because Todd's notes.

Yeah, so actually, I was, I was quite used to producing these kind of like rather longish latex documents, um, of. And what I would do is, is like, as I was doing the courses at Manchester, I would try and summarise them and like, distil them down. It's a prose, essentially, as much as I could.

Um, and then Purposes, which I would then publish after the course, have that been something you've done previously for like a levels and stuff? Or was this a sort of new thing? You started doing University? I did do it for a levels. Yeah, I did it. I think the first ones they didn't put for gcses.

Right. Um, and honestly I think it started out as a way to procrastinate. Um I I loved to like write in latex and and it was just fun to like you know, as I was supposed to be revising for my yeah. So like it was much more fun for me to type set than to actually revise.

Um, and I think that's how it started and then, you know, but there is also a bit of reflection in there, isn't there? Because you're thinking when you're writing these notes, you're thinking, what's this all about and why would anyone care? Yeah, and actually like all those were really useful for other people but actually

It was, it was a weird thing for me, that these things I was producing for myself. Then turned out to be useful for other people internet sensation. No. I imagine I go that far. Well, at least within the Kelvin building. Yeah. But um, yeah, I think the, the person who learnt the most from them was almost certainly me because I was the one who was having to kind of figure out how do I understand this, and how do I, then explain it.

Um, which and then use, explain it in your own words, rather than the words of your professors or lecturers. You would use probably different words. Yeah. Some other time I guess. Yeah. 100. Is there anything more we want to say? I think we've covered the interesting stuff in one thing.

I would say is I, I had this big deal number. Did I want to do an eon industry, right? Um, and in the end, I decided not to because I did a few internships before, um, but my friends were doing years in Industry and that was, that was part of the dilemma for me.

So I didn't want to like go and do it and kind of delay graduation, right? Yeah. And but at the same time, I meant my the third year that I did I didn't do with my some of my best friends who I went out and then came back and you graduated.

Yeah. But it worked out fine. In the end and they stayed in Manchester so I still live with them. Yeah. But like we didn't do the course together. Yeah. Yeah. And I think I think I think we always say to students is, um,

Is by apply for everything and and you can fit your degree around whatever you find. Yeah, if you find the right job for you in the right place and work out what sort of degree, whether it needs to be three or four years. Yeah, I think that's great advice because what you don't want is to be in a position where you have only bad options.

Yeah, you want. If you can give yourself a few good options, then you know whatever happens you'll be fine but if you end up in a situation where, you know, And you're gonna have to make a decision that isn't what you want which might turn out to be fine, but probably it's better better if you can avoid being in that situation in the first place.

Easier said than done, right? That so that comes to the end of Uh your degree yeah normally ask like people what they're doing next. You've obviously done quite a lot since next because this is now nine years ago because 2016. Yeah and so the interesting thing is what you've done since because you've taken Journey in getting interested in policy around technology and science.

So, can you tell us a little bit about how that Journey started? You started out as a graduate. Software engineer at, what did you go back to going? Back to going back to Google and then then things started happening. So can you talk us through that a little bit?

Yeah, so yeah, I went back to Google, um, and that was for me, like, this huge thing and I was absolutely over the moon, to, to go back to Google and it was wonderful. You know, I had everything I had the job that I wanted ever since I was a kid, I had a great salary, I lived in a place.

I'd really come to love Munich. Um, Google tourism where you could go to different species and use your, your use your ID card to go into and, you know, let's see what the London office is like. So I think the culture is slightly changed now, but back then, um, being being a part of Google was, it was a bit like having access to an exclusive club because, you know, I I could go to pretty much any capital city and badge my way into an office, which would have, you know, Jim and sometimes at swimming pool climbing climbing gym, you know like all sorts of

Um, and and, you know, and often there was a lot of, uh, quite vernacular culture in these offices, like, the Italian office. I remember, against the Milan office and they had great lunch, they had great Italian food, and so yeah, these aspects of working there were quite special at the time and I think back then that they kind of perhaps Google had this special culture when it was a startup.

Yeah. And so that still carried on when it was quite a big company. Yeah. So I remember joining him, they still had these meetings every Friday where the founders Larry and Sergey, they would kind of go on stage and they would, they would. It was really funny. Like Sergey Bryn is quite the comic, he would go on stage and then there would be a bunch of slides.

And he wouldn't know what they were or like, at least it didn't look like, he knew what was coming, and then he would like, look at the slide. I mean, he'd be like, oh, there's a product lunch that we've done this week. Like what is it? And then he would try and figure out what Google had launched from this one slide that he'd been given and and it was like simultaneously say this but also quite quite unserious and as a result quite funny and that was the the atmosphere, um, it was it was like really, they push people push each other a lot.

The quality was very high but at the same time, it was, there was a trying to be a culture of having having fun, which is great.

Choosing that. So where did the interest in? Yeah. What do you do now? Yeah, so so not from this actually. Um, so I Basically, um, I've always had a public interest, uh, kind of bent in in what I, what I wanted to do. So I mentioned, I wanted to be a doctor to begin with and then one of the things that Drew me toward was computer science and being a programmer was, it was basically the, uh, when apps, like Google Maps came along.

Um, you know, I witnessed my parents arguing in the car with paper maps. You know, my mum trying to read the map and trying to not get casted because my dad's trying to drive, but he also couldn't read the map and driving etc, etc. And then we got the TomTom, um, which basically didn't stop the amount of arguments but directed the arguments towards the TomTom, which was, which was a big Improvement.

Um, and then we got Google Maps, which was again a big Improvement over that. Yeah, so in my head as someone who was growing up like this was what Tech was doing was like, it was creating things that would be useful, and that could make your life better. Yeah.

Um, yeah.

These team. As I said, I mean as a graduate. Yeah. Back to the family. I went back to the families team but then the whole team house switched around and we ended up working on passwords and so by the time, like most of my favourite school interests, right? Yeah, honestly has really been a feature of my Injury.

Um, so yeah, I work. So Google's password manager and which was a really fun project because, you know, a lot of people use a, um, you can launch code and you see like, the amount of people using it and the request coming in and there's a lot of them.

And obviously, the stakes are quite high because people security is at risk. So, just using using a Google login on the Federated, one where you're using your different, you mean, so that was part of the kind of wider Universe of Paso management but specifically, like, when you're using Android or Google Chrome, remember right.

Okay. Yeah. So that, that was there, what the team I was working with, right? Um, so that's what I was doing at Google and it was a lot of fun. But here's, here's what got me, kind of thinking outside of of that world, if you like, was that in my head, um, I kind of had bought into what I would frame is the kind of silicon Valley approach to what the role of technology in society which is that we have a bunch of these problems and Tech comes along with.

However, I would also, you know, wake up, um, on days when I would go to work, uh, to build the password manager. And I would look at the news and then on the news, there would be, you know, crushing inequality climate crisis, uh, there'd be all sorts of geopolitical, you know, issues, which, you know, continue to get worse and worse all the time.

And then look at what I was doing, and then in my head, there's a few things happening. It's like, I On the one hand, this is something I put on myself and on other people, but I kind of feel a responsibility for some of this stuff. Not that, I think that it's up to me to, you know, right.

Yeah, but I, I think I've been very lucky, um, in the sense that I had lots of opportunities and and I think, you know, I have the capability to, to go. Because I, because I was so lucky and I had so many opportunities. And then in some of that someone has to um and lots of people are, you know, it's not not to say that they aren't.

Yeah. Um and also I I kind of think to myself, you know, this is where this is where the big questions are. This is where some of the real deep stuff is. So I decided to think more about that and and at the start I was really thinking about the climate crisis.

Um I was I was doing like a lot of research and things like carbon offsets Look back at that. And think that I was, you know, just starting out, didn't really understand how, what the, lay of the land was in in these kind of spheres and a friend, um, he was also Google.

Um, she pointed out to me that well in Germany, master's degrees are extremely cheap, like 200 euros, a semester or something, right? With public transport bundled in. So basically free. Time and do a part-time master's degree. So that was over two years. That was my my trial one. Yeah.

So I I did that over. Yeah, two and a half years. So that would have been from 20. It's still quite demanding, because you're having you're doing. Work part-time. Are you doing four? What four, three day weeks for work or yeah, it was, it was demanding. I think demanding is the word.

So I initially went down to 80 so I was doing 80 at work and then 66 Masters degree which of course, if you had those two offers 144. Um, so that was tough. And then I ended up going down to 60 at work so then that comes with that as well.

Yeah, you're having a salary. The pay cut isn't too bad because you're already being paid a good salary. Anyway. Well that's but also and the way that compensation works at these big tech companies is usually you get paid in stock, right? As well as salary and the stock kind of vests over several years.

So what happens is, if you go on to part-time, um, the stock that you previously earned continues to rest, right? And so, the lower salary kicks in kind of gradually. And so you feel the effects of the lower salary most or

I don't know if that makes sense. Yeah, that's what I mean. So it is. Yeah. It's, it's a, it's a, what would you call it? Like a delay. Yeah, a lag. A lag, a time lag. That's the, that's the systems Dynamic. Switch to say. Yeah, um, So so that wasn't too bad.

Um, and I think It, it was a wonderful time because I was really doing something you're interested in, right? That's some more important than how much money you're running. It was so fun. And really so I went into I went to study politics and Technology which was a master of science basically inputs.

But looking at how technology changes the way that Society works, right? And then how politics but also Society more broadly kind of responds to that uh through regulation, or through changing institutions or through like not responding adequately in some cases, etc, etc. Um, and for the first time, I think I got a little bit of a critical perspective on on technology if you like and, you know, maybe just coding and coding and coding and coding, was not going to be it for us basically.

Game, it kind of had slowly dawned on me that Was working at Google, which is a huge company and which is a tremendously important company. You know, it's like it's gateway to all this information that we see, um, online advertising is Google's, obviously its main business, but that has all sorts of questions about privacy as well.

Yeah. Um, and so, this was interesting to me and I think and and to cut a long story short where I went next from that was I realised that Google was, um, a monopoly like in search Google has, you know, High nine kit sharing and a lot of different countries.

It's kind of like the a t of it's it is. Yeah. Yeah. But appreciate the ATT was a regulated Monopoly. Yeah. Um, regulated in the same way, maybe that's changing a little bit. Um, and that was an interesting question to me because I was like, well, why is Google Monopoly?

Um, why is that the case? Um, and the the narrative I had as someone who was working Google was that Google is a very Innovative company. It produces the best search engine. The people want to use

I think most intense in purpose is free. Um, yeah. Like they have this whole ecosystem of products and services. And, and what happened was that I, um went, sorry. I took a course in competition law in my masters. Um, and I ended up competitional competition law. Yes, yeah, so we'll get on to competition look, probably.

Um, and, and I went to a conference with all these competitional academics and for them, Google in particular, but also big other big tech, companies were like the big uh, kind of where the big questions were at essentially, right? Uh and and still are to a large extent because it doesn't have well, I'm sure it does have a competitor in chat GPT now in a sense, right?

Not just competing on its products, isn't that there's no competitor in search? Well,

I think the big difficulty that was that was there kind of from From like 2012 up until like the early 2020s that maybe I would characterise as the difficult part was that Google was giving away things for free. So usually if there's big business, one of the ways that they uh can exploit power is that they will increase prices for things you know so you become a monopoly what you do you increase your prices consumers have to pay more um and then you get lots of profit right and and this was the mental model, the competition lawyers were using competition economist to to think about Market power and which doesn't really applied to Google.

Exactly. Yeah. And Tech had taken this and like, completely turned down its head, and they were really trying to conceptualize. Well, hang on a minute. Google is giving away stuff for free, but like how is it making money? How is it Monopoly? And and there was these theories of two-sided markets, which basically bring advertising Etc, but no one had quite figured out like, what exactly was going on here and the big narrative for why, Google was a Monopoly at the time, was it has all the data like Google has access to everyone's

Um, and and you know, to this day you can find academic papers. Um, that authorities have authoritatively will tell you that big Tech is big because they have all the data. But, you know, I, I was there trying to build these platforms at Google with access to all the data you know, not because Google has very strong controls in terms of what DC can read, Etc.

Um, Know in principle. If there was business interest, you could, you could probably access data that you would need. And the, the key thing, this would miss, of course, and if you're, if you're a tech person, you probably understand it's quite intuitively. Is that well, you might have all sorts of data.

But what information does it contain, you know, if I have data about, you know, the the gene sequences that I've sequenced of some pigeons then it's not going to help me figure out what the next lottery. Ticket number is. Yeah. Um, and so, this was something I really saw and there I began to see a gap.

I saw ah, like there was a gap where I understand something about the way these platforms are built and the way they work, and the way that the competitive Dynamics work a little bit. And either, I don't understand that properly, um, or these people in this other field that I've just kind of dipped my toe in.

Don't understand it properly, but clearly there's a gap. Yeah. So I began to get more interested in this thing called competition. Um,

The competition law is the law, which tries to make sure that our market economy remains competitive. Right. So, you know, we have, you can make a company you can make products that people want to consume. That's the way that our society works for for, you know, better or worse.

And obviously, if you're a company, you don't want to compete against people other companies because they will take away your profit. Yeah, basically um they they're going to force you to innovate or force you to drop your prices and things. So you want to introduce the competition, but if you do that, then you're gonna benefit and consumers out.

There are going to not benefit, uh, they'll have a worse deal. So competition is about trying to make sure that companies actually compete against each other rather than the pretend it could be. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the referee of the market economy. Yeah. Basically and then occasionally, you have computational authorities that call in the VAR and they say, hang on what, what happened here.

I mean that's where antitrust laws. What's the equivalent of antitrust? That's competition in Europe. We call it competitional in the US. Okay, right. I can't realise the same thing. So, so then I ended up, I found myself applying for PHD programs in competition law. Um, Yeah, and you're replying.

So this is what you've been doing for the last four years now at UCL in London. Yeah. Um you uh, I mean, I suppose. Was it was, it was, were there any difficulties in? Because, I guess the people you're competing with. To get on the PHD program, but then also, to publish papers, Coming from very different backgrounds that must have been quite an interesting Journey.

Yeah, the first paper I submitted to a journal got quite brutally rejected, right? Because of this. And and I think for good reason I, you know, I think I it was not framed in the right way. But yeah. Um, And it was weird. So I think I'm very, very lucky at UCL to have a supervisor who's very open-minded and can take someone like me who has a quite unconventional background in law.

Um or for a lawyer sorry um because yeah like coming in I had no I had no training at all. So it was kind of interesting question now is, do you think it's easier for a computer scientist to pick up law or a lawyer to pick up computer science technology.

Depending it depends a little bit on what their backgrounds are, obviously. But so generally speaking, I think, generally speaking, it's easier to go from a kind of more I'm not sure if I like the word hard but a harder discipline, as in like, it's more with more mathematical. Yeah, into a softer discipline like like law like political science or sociology or something.

And the reason why is I think it's hard to learn maths. It's hard to go get to grips with with that computer science and software, engineering really is like, this is applied maths at the end of the day. Um, and I think you need to spend a lot of time doing that and kind of sitting with it and, you know, and and the thing is, if you're already quite senior, it's hard to give yourself that time to like.

Yeah. Um, Although I have to say my PhD, there's been a lot of failing repeatedly but hopefully in a way that is Progressive failing. I think there's programs like cs50 do cs50 for law, don't they? So there's a law, there's a law, a special law version of cs50. I've seen interesting, it's pitched at lawyers like you're a lawyer, but you need to learn how to program.

Yeah. So here's a flavour of cs50 for you same versions of that but it's quite interesting. Yeah, but I mean, I think it's still doable and it's probably still worth it but Whether it makes sense. Depends on you. It depends on what you want to do. Yeah. For what it's worth.

I've been teaching uh the undergraduate law, uh, first years in the past two weeks and there was one of them who had a computer science degree and wanted to do a second degree in law. And I've seen people do the other way as well like me. Um yeah it's I I have to say going and reading law judgements is In a different way to begin with a lot of words, you have to navigate.

Yeah, yeah. Understand really change your attention span. Learn a different language. Basically, it's still written in English but mentioning Latin as well earlier is like a laced with Latin? Yeah. France Centre No Doubt it. Is it it is? Yeah. It can be tough. Okay. So um Think we've covered.

We've covered your very interesting story and there's probably a lot more that we could talk about. But, let's move on to, I'd like to move on to we've touched on this already. Actually is minority Report, it is um, I ask people if they identify as being a member of a particular, minority group, and then also, like what that experience has been?

Is there anything that Universities or employers could do to make it easier. For people who are a member of that minority group. So you can, you can you describe the minority group? You'd consider yourself? Yeah. Well, I had to wrap my brains a little bit because I'm not entirely the person who, like, intuitive into the minority report.

But, um, yeah, I mean, we've talked about it. I, I am someone who works and does research in a law faculty, but I don't have a lot of green. Yeah. Um, and This kind of weird interdisciplinary, background is something that probably is going to becoming more common. Um, especially I mean, in in Lords, it's so obvious because now so many things in my field are touched by Tech.

Um, and you know, some of the questions I wrote recently on generative, AI in competition law. And the reason why that is relevant is because companies keep using generative AI in their Pro, in their products, and that just creates a bunch of legal questions. And then, if you want to write authoritatively on that, then having a computer science background and having taken a bunch of AI courses.

In your undergrad, is like really, really helpful. Yeah. Um, and Really like, Cool with it. The fact that I don't have a law degree, I think the person who's least cool with it is probably me actually when I have to go into, you know, a faculty and and start to try and teach.

Yeah. Um and and trying to convince myself that actually. It's okay. And I do I do have something something to say that's of Interest. Yeah. And I think being open to that, open to these different backgrounds and And the different people can give different things with when they have those different backgrounds.

It's probably something I would say, because there was a, there was a company that we worked with recently that in that offered these dual internships, which were quite interesting. So they said, they want back a computer scientist to work with a Philosophy. Because they were looking at exactly this.

And so, rather than trying to teach the computer science to the philosophy student or to teach philosophy to a computer science students, they said, well, hire them as a pair, we'll pair them up. I work on the same project. Yeah, I can't remember the name of the company, but I'll see if I can dig it out.

But those come that worked quite well because they could see that, you know, Is right. And where where the good stuff often happens is where you pair people up from quite different backgrounds. Yeah, often from Humanities with science. Yeah. Yeah, I can definitely speak to that. Yeah. I so my PhD is again.

Surprisingly, I didn't intend this but in my first year I found out that ecology. Um, so the people who study living species have been doing all this research on the way that species compete with each other. And that, um, Which in, in my undergrad here, I'd done some complex complex networks, which is like super related to conflict systems.

Now a master they've done complex systems and like, I only had this, uh, kind of perspective and then I found out that ecologists have been studying competition with sorry, not competitional competition from the same perspective, right? Yeah. And so what my PhD has ended up being which I had no idea at all going in and if you look at like the initial research purpose, like I made, it's like nothing nothing to do with.

It is taking these theories from ecology and then transplanting them into the way. The competition law thinks about what is right, well, so are you talking like mathematical model that's going on? Yeah, so from a formal, mathematical perspective, right? Um, and also from a more like philosophical, like, what is going on here?

An ontology. If you like, right, we should get into that. That's really interesting. So, yeah. Um,

Yeah, it's going pretty well. Um, I'd like to know um what you do to not, not to improve research and that's just that's a separate question is to improve the quality of the teaching and learning while at University. Now, obviously A lot's changed since you graduated but you were exposed to some good teaching and you were probably exposed to some less good teaching.

Um, To try and improve the quality of teaching and learning that students do at University. Yeah. Semi strongly opinionated view on this. I would bam AI from University, right? And, and the reason why is, is, I think AI does not help you learn. And at University, we are here to learn fundamentally and research is a little bit different because you know, that is something else.

But if you're doing, you know, you're doing a degree where you are training yourself. Then I, I think AI is something to be very suspicious of, and to use an analogy. Um, I would think about a forklift truck. Um, now if you work in a warehouse, a forklift truck is absolutely invaluable.

Like, unless you're you know, super strong, you know, you want this machine to be picking up these super heavy crates and shifting them around for you, but then to take your forklift truck after, uh, you know, an eight hour shift in the warehouse and drive it to your local gym and then, you know, start using it to on the bench press kind of defeats the object of the gym and is also probably going to annoy everyone with the petrol fumes.

Broadway and then we will learn. And then when we've kind of learnt how to do these things ourselves and and, you know, being in the gym, you know, the gym is a hard place. You have to push these heavy weights around and it's uncomfortable. But when you've done that, then you come out, ideally, uh, better.

Yeah. And then, if you want to use the forklift truck, great, but you can rely on the forklift truck and be an incredibly unhealthy unfit forklift truck driver and it won't help you if you then no longer have the forklift or if you need to have, if you need to do something else.

So that would be my something, there's two problems with that. Is one. Problem is obviously it's almost impossible. Well, it's very hard to ban it because like there's a lot of conversation about. Okay, we've just got to adapt and we've got to change the way that we assess students learning, for example.

A solution to that problem. It'd be nice if you could ban it. So you say people who forces people to do things, the hard way and to actually think about what they're doing. But um, How could we actually do that in practise? I mean, it, you're right. If you was to literally figure out a way to ban it, it would be difficult because, you know, every year also, like these these models, get smaller and smaller, and you can fit them in more and more devices, right?

So, it's, it's going to be like a losing battle. I think, from a technological point of view to figure out how to do it, and I know also it attempts to figure out ways to fingerprint the outputs of llms. So it's like detectable exposed have also, uh, been difficult.

I think Scott Arsen was working on that is this wonderful, uh, complexity there is and if he can't do it, like, I don't know if you can. Um, I don't know what this test of that project was.

Know, it's not going to help you. You know, you can, you can get AI to solve this question. Like, you know, let's go back to me, trying to prepare for these coding interviews. Yeah, you can get an LLN to produce and a Flawless, merge sort for you in in the third of a second.

And it might take me, you know, like five minutes to figure out how to write merge salt on a good day, and it probably is not going to be flawless, but like there is value in doing that myself because then I deeply understand it. And I think as humans, we only learn through experience.

I think, you know, you can't get the L and to produce it and then look at it and be like, ah yes, I understand it like there's a deeper level of understanding but you have to push through and I think it's hard to enforce that, except through, you know, vigorous in-person exams from the point of view at the University, but I think the first line defence of Defence should be a cultural one.

A cultural thing where smoking becomes unacceptable in public spaces and it just, it took a while to happen, but it did happen. Uh, maybe there's a similar thing with AI where it's like, it becomes. Culturally unacceptable to be using it. Yeah, in certain contexts. Yeah but especially when you're trying to learn.

Yeah I think it should be. I mean I've seen academics using AI at conferences to write papers. Yeah. And I felt yeah, it really changed my view of the academic that I saw doing that to be honest. Like I I think the research is good but then when I watched them generating it with an llm, I'm like, well, you know what's, why should I read it?

What's the point in reading it? Detection problem, isn't there particularly with the papers is like you? How do you know whether it's difficult to prove one way or another? Where something whether something's come from another level or not? Yeah, yeah. With or without fingerprinting? Yeah, but I think from the University's point of view, one option is to make assessments, which are, which are a in person and B, like, very hard to use an llm with right?

And I, that's that's tough. That is very tough, particularly in computer science because you're given, you know, if you're doing an algorithms course, then you're given usually quite well, defined problems. Yeah, llms are absolutely brilliant ads. Yeah. Give me an algorithm that does this with these inputs create these outputs.

It's like, yeah, you can do that until the cows come out, right? Yeah. But I think it does depend on the course. But one example, I really like is the University of Waterloo, they have a kind of like a low-level programming lab, which I think locally is called the train lab, right?

And basically they give you a model train set and you have to write the microcontrollable software that will do the switching for

And I think a lot of the problems like a lot of the debugging there is going to be so task specific and like a lot of the the the exercise is going to be figuring out. Why is my train repeatedly crashing at this particular Junction? And I think you know, To get chat GPT to help you with that.

Like, by the time you figured out how to formulate the question to chat TPT in a way that will get it. To give you a coherent response, you've done. The majority of the work to like, actually think about that. So I think there are ways but it the bar is high.

Yeah, it's difficult. Yeah. You've done done everything you want? Is there anything else without supreme power as Vice Chancellor? Uh, okay. Well, maybe because you could so, the other part of this is your, your influence as a vice Chancellor, it isn't just within the university. It's in, Through our, the vice Chancellor.

When you were a student here was Nancy Rothwell and she also chaired the Russell group, which is A large group of universities in the UK. So you also have influence in what other universities are doing. Yeah, just what your own University's doing. Well, if I, if I had more political influence of course, I would raise the the question of funding for universities, which is a big issue today, I'm not, I'm not sure if I have the expertise.

Yeah. So have a good opinion about that now, but it's a big question that we should be thinking about. But, aside from that, the other thing that comes to mind is I think in this perspective, I got from studying in Germany, in in the UK, our degree courses are quite linear, in the sense that you go and do computer science as a bachelor's degree.

And then almost all the courses, you will do, will be computer science, courses and in a way that's fine. And I think that's also part of our academic culture, we specialise in the UK, quite early. Like we only do, I only did three a levels but if you speak to a French student, they'll still be studying like 10 subjects.

Um, but I think one thing that could be really good is to give students more flexibility in what courses they want. And, of course, like, I'm this like,

Taking of the faculties. And I think we should be really trying to enable that more and giving And giving students like the ability to choose to do these these courses um, without barriers. And at the end of the day, if they've then fail your exam that's on them, in my opinion.

You know? Like, and, and I speak from first-hand experience. I went and did a physics course in my master's degree, uh, on complex systems, non-linear Dynamics, and boy, was I unqualified for this, right? It was like a master's level course, I never taken bachelor's level physics and, and it was super tough and I got a bad grade and but it was really, really important for them laying the foundations for the PHD research centre right now.

Um, and and it was a great decision. I love the course I didn't, I did, well, I guess at the extreme end of this, this is like

The idea behind prerequisites. Is that okay? You say that in order to do this, you need to know this first. Yeah, the linear approach. Whereas the flexible approach is, well, anyone can do this course. And if you haven't done this, this and this then you might struggle, you're going to have to a lot to learn but you can still do it.

Yeah, if you have determine. Yeah. And I I think the middle ground there here is to say these are the prerequisites that we think you should have. Have them, it's on you, you know, don't come to me saying that, you know, I I can't add up if you're then doing a doing a like a master's level physics course, you know, like I I'm not gonna be the person teaching you to add, but, you know, if, if you did the prerequisites and you still don't understand that.

That's okay. Yeah. Um, and I think some people are better that that than others in the Where the gaps are and then filling them. Some people are better at that than others but yeah, this afternoon there's often a way. Yeah. Okay, good. So um, we I think we've done vice Chancellor now I think.

So let's move on to stressful positions. The last two questions. Well, the last one is, this is more the personal one. So, one tune, one podcast, one book and one film. Yeah. Uh, so should we start with one two, a piece of music or pieces of music that are important to you?

You recommend other people. Listen to them. Why say, why they're important? So I am a huge Muse fan, right? I absolutely love news. Um, so I have two pieces or two songs from, from Muse, um, Is, it's called map of the problematique. Um, and I think a lot of the Muse songs.

I like I like, because of the musicality, and you never quite know what you're going to get from them because they're quite eclectic. Um, but one of the reasons I'd like map of the problematic is, is for the references. So it references. So the problematic is this idea that you have all these different kind of coinciding problems.

And that in order to try and address one of them, you need to also address all the other ones. Um, so for example, or some of the other ones. So, for example, like the climate process today, you know, if we are to address it, we also need to be thinking about inequality.

Yeah. Um, and, and in the song, harks back to this, this seminal report that was produced in 1972, the limits to growth of which one of my academic Heroes, uh, what was she called? Danelle and Meadows, was one of the authors. Um, there's a wonderful podcast about that, actually, well, on the topic of podcasts, um, by Sarah Woods who's who's a playwright on the limits

Is kind of systemic issues. Um, and why can't we see that when we bleed real bleed the same as in like, in order to overcome some of these questions or like big dilemmas that we face as a collective. We need to have empathy for each other and see that, you know, we're all in this kind of predicament.

Yeah. And and yeah, exactly, exactly. So that's one of my one of the ones I love and then related to that uh Muse has this other song called butterflies and hurricanes. Um, It draws on. Um, this this idea of Chaos Theory, you know, when a butterfly flaps its wings in Tokyo, then there might be a hurricane in in New York or something like that.

Um, but ultimately it's a song about Hope actually is it's a song about when you win this, these predicaments. Uh, you know, when you have this apparently intractable problematique, um, there are there's gonna be a way. There's, there's things that you can do. And, and if you look at the lyrics of the song, I feel a bit guilty, kind of saying, what the Abserver, cheesy in a sense, but there there is, sometimes it don't translate from it works.

Well in a musical when you translate it into just speaking. I don't have Matt. Melanie kind of Biz to be able to pull that off. I think so I'll I'll leave that as homework.

Next one is one podcast, so you kind of touched on one podcast already, but I think there was a, was there. Another one you wanted to mention? Yeah, uh, so any podcasts, I love podcasts. Um, so is that a podcast? I really got a lot from is, is philosophized.

This, it's, it's quite a popular one, I think. But basically, uh, there's there's basically one episode on most of the big philosophers and it goes all the way from kind of heraclitus and ancient Greece, all the way up to jijek today, and it's kind of Western, but it's not only exclusively Western and it's, and it's you.

And it's, it's just so fascinating to kind of, like, do a deep dive in all these different perspectives. Um, we've done a kind of accessible way it is, it doesn't assume that you know about philosophy already. No, it tries to make it fun and I would say it's accessible.

I mean, most the time I half, listen while I'm exercising. So so, you know, it's it's not that intense. As far as philosophy podcasts go at least and then there's so many others are, how many of us? There's one there's one in London called, make poetry weird again, which is basically what it says.

Same swimming pool in London, that the Alistair Campbell who's the host of Classics is always talking about him. I occasionally, see him in the pool, but so far. He's never talked about something, tell him to talk about in the podcast. So, It maybe one day, I'm like the rest of it.

It's good. It's a good podcast. It's fun. Um, So as from Pakistan, we've got one book, could be fiction non-fiction. Yeah, okay, so I have, I have two books, I'm so sorry. And so my book for computer science, people actually they're both looking to be science people. But but I think the one that really um, helped me as a engineer, I guess is the art of doing science and engineering by Richard Hamming, right?

I came across Hamming in my third year, um, where [Barry Cheetham](https://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~barry) who's wonderful wonderful lecture here. I don't know if he's still retired now, but yeah, and but he was teaching us about things like having codes and and stuff like that and I stumbled across Richard having's book and he's basically this like very very distinguished.

Now I'm using this policies to terminology. Uh he's this distinguished um professor of mathematics and computer science. He's sadly passed away now but this book is his like Grand Grandpa, wisdom of career basically and it's about being an academic, it's about being a researcher, it's about being a good engineer.

Yeah, how to interact with colleagues, how to choose problems, how to make your own look, etc. Etc. Um, and just Reflections basically and and also there's an addition from stripe press, which is quite beautiful. It's like an aesthetic object as well. So the hardback a hardback. Yeah, yeah, it's, it's very nice.

So, that's one recommendation. The other one, which I've spied on your shelf actually is, uh, gold lasher. Embark. All right, yes. Um, which I had I, I guess it's the fortune, but also the misfortune of having recommended to me when I was 14. So, for 14 year olds, it was a lot.

And I don't think I really got it back then. But at the same time, it kind of late put these seeds in my head of like, uh, of being interested in systems being interested in philosophy and being interested in ideas about like what is cognition self-reference, that kind of thing.

And yeah, the book is the book is about this thing called a strange Loop. So, this idea that, um, there's a hierarchy of things, and then when you get to the top of the hierarchy,

Super recessive law and which is also something that hofstra talks about. Um if if we have a disagreement and then we go to court and then let's say you went the court case and then I appeal and I guess the appeals court and then I win and then because of the Supreme Court and then you win I'm still not happy.

Then the only quote that's higher than the Supreme Court is the court of public opinion. Outside of the court system and back in the domain of public life, which is why we have the dispute in the first place, right? And this is like a strange Loop. So this concept pops up all over the place and I mean we've got seen a thing with God Elisha back is a lot of people struggle with the length of it.

It isn't. How did you? Tackle that any strategies for tackling it, because It's got lots of interesting important things to say, but it is quite The Bose. Yeah. What can we say? Yeah, the way the way I tackled that is but is is by, you know, trying to read it over an entire summer, right?

Very slowly dipping into it. Like yeah. And, and I wouldn't recommend that because there's many, many more productive and useful, and fulfilling ways than you can spend your summer and bashing your head against this book repeatedly. Um, I think the, I think the author, uh, Douglas hofstra has, actually answered this question where she's produced a sequel called.

I am a strange Loop? Oh okay. Um, which is is I I have to say it's a really beautiful book, there's a section on it about his wife who passed away um, and about his relationship with her and how like he, um,

And how he knew her. So well that she's kind of like a copy of her exist within him. Right. And then like but this is explained and framed in the whole story. Yeah. Strangely, it's a bit more accessible. Would you say? I would say it's more accessible. It's more concise, it's more focused and on the arguement.

Yeah. And and the reason why I think he wrote that book was because people were confused about what exactly good life was trying to say. Okay, which is understandable. Yeah. Uh gold leschenbach is extremely impacted. Yeah, yeah.

I think we've done my books so I think we've done my books. Yeah we've got well the last one is one film. Yeah, people don't watch. So I I was last year I went to the British Film Festival. It was the BFI Film Festival, sorry. Um and I watched this wonderful Brazilian movie called, I'm still here by Walter Salas and it's a movie set in 1971.

I think, um, under the Brazilian dictatorship at the time It's a movie about the false disappearances that were happening. So it kind of dictated which was taking political the important figures and making them go away. Um and but really the movie is about the family. It's about the preciousness of the family.

How how like the frivious, what's the word? Uh the frivial nature of family, life is special in a sense. Yeah and how horrible dictation can take that away right? But then how after that the family can re-knit itself and kind of overcome that and it's very it's quite moving in some Portuguese.

Okay. But I was sometimes subtitles that make it work. Yeah. Yeah. Um, actually the, the other thing it's not on the list here, but one thing you talked about earlier briefly mentioned is you did a stand-up comedy course

Little bit about that in terms of Why you did it? Yeah, I got from it. Well sometimes I don't know if this happens to you but I will get an email and when I read the email, I have kind of a sinking feeling because it's an email that I with an opportunity, that is incredibly scary but I also know that I have to do it.

If that makes sense. And that's exactly what happened. You're sort of person who can't say no or are you uh is it one of those words? Can't say no. But it's tempting. Not to say yeah. Because, you know, it's going to be hard but you know, it's going to be also be interesting.

Exactly. Yeah. I I might my curiosity get to the better of me. Basically. And that's exactly what happened and basically, this course was a sustainable stand-up course. It's called and run by this wonderful facility. It's called billina uh bellina Rafi. Um and and the idea is is to communicate ideas about um sustainability and the predicament that we Face relating to that, which is a heavy thing, you know, it's a tough thing.

If you take things like the ipcc reports and Tipping Points, seriously, it's not an easy topic and to communicate those ideas in a way that is obviously humorous, but with compassion and with love, right? So it's a tough brief basically. Um, you can't resort to sarcasm.

Me all sorts of things. Um, about trying to tell stories, right? And making sure that the person you're telling the story to has all the information that they need to understand the story, right about the narrative, how that works because the joke, really? It's, it's supposed to be a story where there's kind of a missing bit of information that's unexpected, right?

That, that you then drop in at the end and then it's like, ah, that's right, that's comfortable. Yeah, yeah. And you like, build up the tension and then you release the tension with work. Um,

And the process was, uh, was almost Socratic where we would go on a zoom call every week for eight weeks and we would perform our sets, which at the start were embryonic, um, and and we would, you would be able to see the other people on the zoom call not laughing.

As you would tell the jokes, and then slowly as dying Elaine comedians. Call out dying. I think, and where you die on stage? Yeah. Do you think what you're saying is funny? Yeah. No one's ritualistic. Yeah. And, and then slowly over the eight weeks, like, people set started to develop and the things that they think were funny, but weren't funny.

It start to drop away and the things that were getting a few laughs like, got more. Yeah. Yeah. And by the end. Yeah. Like we had something. So there was I think eight of us who did the course and then we did it, it's just entirely online. No, so the the course itself was mostly online.

The final thing is the first session and the fighting future. Yeah, in person and then

Excellent. Um, so we're on to the last thing which is time, traveller. So you mentioned physics. There somebody in physics, in Manchester has invented a time machine. Well, they've lent us great. And they assure me that it works. And you can travel back in time to meet yourself. At any point, really?

But I suppose, the interesting point is starting University. What would you? What would you tell your former self? Yeah, I have. I have an obvious bit of advice and a deeper bit of advice to the obvious bit of advice is in 2013, Todd Davis by Bitcoin as much as you can.

Yeah. All that money, that you end being a web developer reinvest it like do not spend any of it. Um, you know, like live off beans. Yeah, eat beans. Yeah. And yeah, because back then it was like, 400 dollars. And what is it? Now, I think it's over 100 000 around after that.

Yeah. So yeah, that would have been great and just be people out there who have done that. Yeah, I knew about it back then, like I only had myself to blame. I and I talked about, you know, Mining and stuff with with my colleagues at the time, and yeah, I didn't do it.

So, oh, well. So that's one thing. The other thing I would say to myself, um, is

And I think when I went in, I had this idea that I was going to learn this skill and then I was going to get a job and put the skill into practise. And I think University is about a lot more than that, it's about becoming educated. And at University like I guess the the trivial way to say is like the more you get in the more you put get out but what I also mean is like a long different dimensions.

Um so you know if you just work and you just try and get good great grades then you know, probably you'll do well academically. But there's so many more things that you want to learn. And the university is such a great opportunity to really stretch yourself, intellectually emotionally spiritually.

You know, you have to date people. You have to like, go on crazy trips. You have to like, you know, join society's stuff. You'd never normally do. Yeah, and really push yourself. Like, you know, go and go and take the stand-up comedy course. And that's something I learnt much, much later on.

And I really benefited a lot from the things that I did when I learnt that. But at University, I remember like, distinctly having this feeling, I need to get great grades because those grade grades are. What's going to help me? I can understand, I see a lot of students in the same position now where it might be, parental pressure or it might just be their own.

It means that. And doing something else? Yeah, whatever else is and some so some people else is finding a job like I've spoken to students who said that I I focused my second year on getting a good job. I wanted and my grades took a hit but I'm so glad I did that because I got this fantastic opportunity to end up new doors.

But then, the other one is all the social stuff as well. It's all the people that you're surrounded with the university is you're not here for very long in flies by yeah. Can I think back to my time at University and all the things I remember aren't? I'm the academic stuff was good and interesting but it was as much.

The climbing club and stuff. We still remember years later. I mean, there's some easy wins. You can get like, you know, if you're spending three hours a day on Instagram, reels, like that can go and probably, yeah, you're not gonna lose very much. If I could tell me something, that would be one of them actually.

It's like, you know, now I've stopped the social media basically cut off also. Yeah, I have this tiny phone, um, which is like, like I said, like, it's not a dumb finish. It's got Android right? But, because it's so small, it's just a pain to use, right? Which is wonderful because I can use it to, like, navigate around the city or to apply to a text.

Um, but I can't use it to like spend all day because I'll end up needing a much stronger prescription for my glasses, right? Um,

It's a minority of the time that when you do this other stuff, your grades are going to get hit. I think it's actually the other way around. Is that when you start to broaden yourself you you yeah this can really help you and it can give you a lot more motivation and you can you can study more effectively but also as you kind of transcend, The the earlier on stuff at University.

Um, and you maybe like start to look, not not just within, for example, computer science, but it's intersections with other things then having a broader base, um, will really help you and give you a big competitive Advantage against other people. And that's something I really felt. It's like, the more weird, I became as like an academic or as an individual, and they're more like different things, I added the easier it became for me to do stuff because I wasn't competing against anyone in, in a way.

Um, sort of changes as good as a rest thing, where if you're doing something even if you're studying, I know. German, for example, instead of taking a computer science module, although it's going to be work, it's going to be a different kind of work. And that's actually gonna, I think learning General might be one of the exceptions, the rule actually.

But yeah, this morning, he was doing exactly that they're doing German as a, as a module. Yeah. Second year.

But it's, I mean the principle is definitely right. Like my I can't claim to be a natural language learner and I, I found German hard, but other people, I know have really enjoyed it and I, I took it despite me saying before the British universities are so like kind of set in and getting you to just study.

I think I did manage to take a biology course while I was here. All right. Okay. Um, and you know, maybe that put an idea in my head later on for for my PhD when I've been doing all the psychology. Uh but it was fascinating and it's it's also so rewarding to like do Because you like that, initial learning period is you get a lot of quick wins from that.

Like you get to Grant to grips like the first 80, you can actually quite quickly in like that last 20 might be a bit more difficult and it's very motivating to do that. So that's something else I would say. Yeah. Okay good. I think that's all good goodbye. So I think, um, We'll step back out of our time.

Travel machine back to the day. Thank you very much for coming on today. It's been really interesting to talk to you and we'll to do the video that we did earlier. Maybe I can add that to the show notes maybe. Yeah. Um, Thank you for coming and good luck with finishing off the PHD, and wherever that leads to.

I'm sure it'll go somewhere, interesting and enjoy doing the open day tomorrow, as well. Thank you so much. Thank you for having me on. Thank you. I don't know how long that was.
