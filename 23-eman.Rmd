## One Book {#eman-book}

```

(ref:captionwikikhaled) [Khaled Hosseini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaled_Hosseini)'s debut novel *The Kite Runner* was a critical and commercial success; the book and his subsequent novels have all been at least partially set in Afghanistan and have featured an Afghan as the protagonist. Hosseini's novels have enlightened the global audience about Afghanistan's people and culture. ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡«
