# (PART) BUILDING YOUR FUTURE {-}

# Organising your future {#organising}
You might find it a bit scary thinking about your future. You might be tempted to procrastinate making important decisions about your future, see figure \@ref(fig:schedule-fig). There is a risk of [thrashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)) or getting stuck in a `do-nothing` or [`busy waiting`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting) loop. This guidebook is here to help you break out of that loop. One way to breakout of an unproductive loop is to organise and schedule some time every week where you work on personal development and job applications. Doing good applications takes time and you'll probably find you can't do as many applications as you might like, especially when you consider [Hofstadter's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law): It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

```
(ref:captionschedule) The biggest waste of time is the time spent not getting started on a project. Your future might seem big and unknown but it's really not as scary as you might think and getting started can be surprisingly enjoyable. [New Project?

Your future is bright, your future needs organising, so let's start organising your future.

## Building your future {#make}
In section \@ref(by-quantity) and \@ref(by-quantity) we discussed the importance of timing in your job search. *When* you apply for jobs will determine *what* kind of jobs are available because most graduate schemes and graduate jobs follow a rhythmic recruitment cycle of some kind. How many jobs you apply for is largely a function of how much time you spend doing it. The more time you spend, the more applications you can do.

We haven't explicitly discussed the timing and organisation of the activities outlined in the preceding chapters:

1. *Designing your Future* in chapters \@ref(rebooting) to \@ref(computing)
1. *Testing your Future* in chapters \@ref(debugging) to \@ref(speaking)

Let's imagine you could precisely specify all of the tests using [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) in a `makefile` or specify them somehow in your favourite Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Ideally, you'd like to automatically run these tests, so that you can build your future systematically. You'd like to repeat these tests periodically, e.g. once a day, week, month or whatever your schedule is, similar to [build automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation) in software engineering. Attempts to automate aspects of job applications and interviews have so far had very mixed results. [@airesume; @dastinai] But, as another thought experiment, let's image it was possible

* So what's in your make file? 
* How often will you run it?
* Which tasks can you automate?
* Which tasks are always going to be manual?

## Scheduling your future {#scheduling}

If you're a University of Manchester student, the live *Coding your Future* (COMP2CARS) workshops sessions are also here to help, every Tuesday at 4pm.  COMP2CARS complements the second year tutorials (COMP2TUT) at the University of Manchester and takes place in the same slot as COMP2TUT when you meet your personal tutor. See your timetable at [timetables.manchester.ac.uk](https://timetables.manchester.ac.uk/). The outline is:

 
* Weeks 1 and 2: COMP2TUT, meet with personal tutor
* Weeks 3 to 6: Seminars in Lecture Theatre A, engineering building 
* Week 7: Reading week - take a breather
* Weeks 8 to 10: Seminars in Lecture Theatre A, engineering building
* Weeks 11 & 12: COMP2TUT, meet with personal tutor

Outside of that, its a good idea to organise some scheduled time to work on continuous professional development (CPD), particularly the not very scary and actually quite enjoyable tasks of designing, building, testing, deploying and coding your future.

## Week 0: Experiencing {#week0}
Welcome week, starting 1th September. 

* Following from the welcome back to year 2 talk from the second year tutor Ahmed Saeed, a panel of students returning from their year of industrial experience told their stories of recruitment and employment 
* Organisations represented included [alpine-cars.co.uk](https://www.alpine-cars.co.uk/), [arm.com](https://www.arm.com/), [bentleymotors.com](https://www.bentleymotors.com/), [cantarus.com](https://www.cantarus.com/), [codethink.co.uk](https://www.codethink.co.uk/), [interactsoftware.com](https://www.interactsoftware.com/), [jpmorgan.com](https://www.jpmorgan.com/), [meta.com](meta.com) (Facebook),  [netcraft.com](https://www.netcraft.com/), [ocado.com](https://www.ocado.com/) and [recourseai.com](https://www.recourseai.com/).

Thanks to our panellists for answering questions via mentimeter Ask Me Anything (A.M.A.) from the audience about their placements and their transition from students to professionals. 

There is more information on *Experiencing Your Future* chapter \@ref(experiencing) and student case studies of employment in chapter \@ref(hearing) on *Hearing your Future*: the Coding Your Future podcast.

## Week 1: Debugging {#week1}
**Tuesday 26th September** at 4pm: Depending on your when you meet your tutor

* *Either* COMP2CARS: Debug your CV (self assessment) using section \@ref(checklist) in *Debugging your future* (chapter \@ref(debugging))
* *Or* COMP2TUT: Meet your tutor see [digital.cs.manchester.ac.uk/student-groups](https://digital.cs.manchester.ac.uk/student-groups/) get feedback on your CV

## Week 2: Debugging {#week2}
**Tuesday 3rd October** at 4pm: Depending on your when you meet your tutor

* *Either* COMP2TUT: Meet your tutor (if you didn't meet them last week) see [digital.cs.manchester.ac.uk/student-groups](https://digital.cs.manchester.ac.uk/student-groups/)
* *Either* COMP2CARS: Debug your CV (self assessment) using section \@ref(checklist). Read *Debugging your future* (chapter \@ref(debugging)) and *Hacking your future* (chapter \@ref(hacking))
