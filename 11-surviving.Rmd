(ref:captionbadges) Your education doesn't finish when you start work, it should be a loop where you constantly acquire knowledge and skills during your career. You don't stop learning when you leave University, surviving and thriving in the workplace is dependent on your constantly acquiring new skills and knowledge, some of which will be badged.

## Survive, thrive or dive? {#scenarios}
Starting a new job is a bit like starting a new relationship. You've been through the courtship of recruitment, this might have been quick or may have had many rounds of first and second dates. Now you're both committed to each other and starting the relationship for real. Simply put, there are three scenarios for you as a new employee. You'll survive, thrive or dive.

### Survive {#survive}

It will go OK, you'll meet the expectations of your employer and become and valued employee. Most employees fit in to this category. 🆗


### Thrive  {#thrive}
It will go brilliantly, you'll exceed the expectations of your employer. If you're on a fixed term contract, such as a summer internship or year long placement, they'll make you a job offer during or soon after your contract of employment expires. If you're on a more permanent contract, such as a graduate job or graduate scheme you'll be promoted and given more responsibility. 💪

You're doing really well if you can impress your manager. Some lucky people make it into this category.


### Dive {#dive}

It will go badly, you will struggle to fit in and won't meet the expectations of your employer. Once you were [star-crossed lovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-crossed), but the relationship has turned sour and may end in tragedy. [@romeo; @goblewroe] There are several relationship problems that could lead to you breaking up with (or being dumped by) your newly estranged lover. 💔

* **Relationship problems**: Your relationship with your manager(s) is not going well. You've tried solving problems informally by talking to your manager but you’re not satisfied with the response and want to [raise a formal grievance complaint in writing](https://www.gov.uk/raise-grievance-at-work). [@grievance]
* **It's not you, it's me**: You might ultimately decide to you want to [hand in your notice](https://www.gov.uk/handing-in-your-notice) to terminate your contract of employment and leave. [@iquit]
* **It's not me, it's you**: If things get really bad, your employer may [take disciplinary action against you](https://www.gov.uk/disciplinary-procedures-and-action-at-work) [@dive] and in the worst case scenario, you'll be [fired (dismissed)](https://www.gov.uk/dismissal). [@yourefired]

Dismissal is rare, but it **does** happen, even to interns and placement students. In this scenario in the UK, the employer has a duty to do everything they reasonably can to prevent this from happening. It's not your employers interests to fire you because they've invested a lot of time and money in you by this point. If they have sensible recruitment procedures, those procedures will root out unsuitable candidates long before they make it to the workplace where they can cause real and lasting damage to the organisation once in post.

All employers have procedures for making sure that you can agree on work that suits both of your needs. Better employers will have better procedures to ensure this happens. Employers don't want their employees to "dive"'"' and will try prevent this from happening wherever possible.

## Managing your manager {#manager}
Building a good relationship with your manager(s) will be key to determining which of the *dive, survive or thrive* scenarios above plays out. At University, you didn't have a manager. Yes you had deadlines, but you didn't have a boss. That changes when you're an employee so it's in your interests to understand what your boss expects of you.

Julia Evans has authored a series of programming [zines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine), there's one called [HELP! I have manager](https://wizardzines.com/zines/manager/) [@helpihaveamanager] you might find useful. It will help you understand your managers job better so that you can work together more effectively It will help you survive and thrive, not dive because it covers:

* understanding your manager's job
* setting clear expectations
* talking about problems early
* promotions & performance reviews
* getting better feedback with specific questions

```

The zine has the benefit of being written by a software engineer so is aimed at people just like you. Thoroughly recommended! You might also enjoy Julia's other more technical zines such as *HTTP: learn your browser's language* [@browserslanguage] and *Oh Shit, Git!*. [@ohshitgit]

## Placement visits {#visits}

During your placement you will be visited by an academic member of staff who will meet with you and your manager at the same time. If you want to meet with your academic tutor without your manager being around, please let your tutor know] The visit is a good opportunity to reflect on what progress you have made during the year alongside areas you need to improve. You will probably already have had similar meetings with your manager or managers, for examples as part of your personal development review (or whatever your employer calls performance reviews). There are three basic questions your tutor will ask you:

1. What have you been doing?
1. WWW: What Went Well?
1. EBI: Even Better If?

### What have you been doing?
Briefly describe your roles and responsibilities during your placement to date. What projects have you worked on? What were the main technologies that you used?

### WWW: What went well?
Are there any projects you are particularly proud of? What new knowledge or skills have your learnt or improved? Remember to include both non-technical as well as technical aspects of your job. Non-technical skills include organisation, time-management, confidence, communication etc.

### EBI: Even Better If?
What areas have you identified for improvement in the future? Again, this includes non-technical as well as technical skills.

### Managers comments
Your tutor will ask your manager to ask the same questions. Are there any differences between your view and your managers view of your placement? If so, why do you differ?

### Placement report
Both your tutor and you need to fill in the placement report, no more than two pages. See the [industrial placement report template on overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/industrial-placement-report/vcjymrgmcpzh)

## Summarising survival {#tldr10}

[Too long, didn't read](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read) (TL;DR)? Here's a summary:
