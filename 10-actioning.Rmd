# Actioning your future {#actioning}

Employers are often more interested in what you have *done*, rather than what you just *know*. Your actions are a key part of your story we discussed in section \@ref(care). A simple technique for emphasising the `action` in your stories is to lead  descriptions of your projects, education and experience with carefully chosen `verbs`, see section \@ref(verbsfirst) for examples.

## Your actions define your impact {#impact}
Your actions define your impact, see figure \@ref(fig:action-fig). What stories you can tell of your actions to date? What verbs best describe how you achieved a result or had an impact? What was the context, action, result and evidence (CARE) we discussed in section \@ref(care) of each (short) story?

```{r action-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionactions)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/your-actions.png")
```
(ref:captionactions) What action have you taken and what stories can you tell about the results and your impact? What are the best verbs for highlighting your actions?

By leading with verbs you will highlight what you have *actually done* and how you did it, rather than what you know. It also helps you cut down on repetitive personal pronouns: `I`, `me`, `my` etc. See the verbs first section \@ref(verbsfirst) of chapter \@ref(debugging) *debugging your future*.

Your future is bright, your future needs actioning, so let's start actioning your future.

## What you will learn {#ilo17}

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

1. Emphasise your *actions* when describing your education, projects and experience on your CV 
1. Reflect on
    + what skills you already have
    + what skills you need to develop
1. Demonstrate those skills explicitly and quickly in job applications

## Breakpoints {#bp17}
(ref:breakpoint)

```md
* PAUSE ⏸️
```

Quickly scan your CV, covering letter or application form for VERBS:

* Where are the verbs?
    + buried deep in long sections of prose? **OR**
    + prominently leading descriptions of your activities?
* Have you over-used certain verbs (like `worked` or `assisted` for example) or been repetitive (like over-using `developed` see alternatives in section \@ref(engineering))
* How can you increase the variety of verbs you have used (without exaggerating or lying)?
* Which verbs are stronger than others and why?
* Are there any categories of verbs you can't provide evidence for, such as leadership (see section \@ref(leading)) or influencing (see section \@ref(influencing))?
    + What activities or projects could you do that would help you develop these missing skills?

## Weasel verbs {#weasel}

The following verbs are [weasel words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word) that *some* people say are too vague and ambiguous:

* `involved` What was your role exactly?
* `worked` Most people work, can you be more specific? 
* `joined` So you became a `member` of something? What did your `membership` actually entail? Did you eagerly sign up at the freshers fair with good intentions never to return, or did you play a more active role?

Weasel words should be avoided, they *look* like they're telling your reader something important, but usually they fail to deliver, see figure \@ref(fig:weasel-fig).

```{r weasel-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionweasel)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/weasel-words.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionweasel) Popular in political parlance, [Weasel words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word) create an impression that something specific and meaningful has been said when in fact only a vague, ambiguous or irrelevant claim has been communicated.

## Bullshit verbs {#BS}

We discussed the dangers of bullshit in section \@ref(bullshit). You might think you can bullshit your readers, but you'll probably just trigger their *bullshit detector*. Examples include:

* `honed` saying you `improved` something and then **quantifying** by *how much* you improved it would be much more convincing
* `spearheaded` Really, are you some kind of hunter-gatherer? Howabout `led`, `managed`, `co-ordinated` or `organised`? See section \@ref(leading). 
* `streamlined` Something smells a bit fishy, it's the kind of thing a politician would say
* `leveraged` not sure about this one, smells a bit dodgy?
* `relished` 
* `delighted` 
* `thrilled`
* `fascinated` 
* `imagineered` Yes, imagination is a crucial part of engineering. But software imagineering? Really? C'mon! 

```{r bullshitter-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbullshitter)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/on-bullshit.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionbullshitter) Are you a bullshitter? Do you have any bullshitty verbs on your CV? Fair use image of the cover of [Harry G. Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Frankfurt)'s best selling little book *[On Bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit)* [@onbullshit] via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/6Bnu](https://w.wiki/6Bnu) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238) 


It's probably best to leave *emotive* verbs and *bullshitty* language out of your CV, see figure \@ref(fig:bullshitter-fig). You may well have been `fascinated, thrilled and delighted to hone your leadership skills while spearheading an innovative project that streamlined business processes`, but there are more professional and less bullshitty ways to describe your experience. 💩



## Summarising your actions {#tldr18}
(ref:tldr)

Your future is bright, your future needs you to take action. Highlighting your actions will help you to test your future and debug your CV. Testing and debugging your future will help you to start coding your future.

Actions speak louder than words, or as suffragette and political activist [Emmeline Pankhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst) frequently said “Deeds not Words”, see figure \@ref(fig:pankhurst-fig). Your CV needs to emphasise your deeds and actions using words. Those words are `verbs`.

```{r pankhurst-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionpankhurst)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/deeds-not-words-pankhurst.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionpankhurst) “Deeds not words” was the rallying cry of suffragette [Emmeline Pankhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst).  Emphasise the deeds (actions) on your CV by leading your stories with carefully chosen `verbs`. Public domain image of Emmeline Pankhurst by Richard Gordon Matzene restored by Adam Cuerden on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3bPa](https://w.wiki/3bPa) and adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238) (If you get the chance, you should visit the [pankhurstmuseum.com](https://www.pankhurstmuseum.com/) on the Oxford Road in Manchester)

On your CV, leading descriptions of your `projects`, `experience`, `leadership and awards` with `verbs` is a simple but powerful technique that enables you to provide evidence (rather than assertion) for the skills, knowledge, competencies and capabilities you have. Choose your `verbs` carefully. Which verbs are missing from your CV? These verbs can help you identify gaps in your professional and personal development.

In the next part, chapter \@ref(finding): *Finding your Future* we will investigate some job search strategies so that you can work out who and where to send your debugged CV to.
