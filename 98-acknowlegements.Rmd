# Acknowledging My Future {#thankyou}

When you stop to think about all the people in your [Personal Learning Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network) (PLNs) who have helped you or made you what you are, it quickly turns into a telephone directory. These acknowledgements started small with a few thanks to students in section \@ref(students) but then it rapidly got out of control and ended up being a chapter in itself. Thanks to everyone in this chapter, part of my PLNs, see figure \@ref(fig:plns-fig)

```{r plns-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionplns)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/PLNs.png")
```

(ref:captionplns) Some people who've helped me have very grand job titles like the `Thought-Leading Disruptive Innovation Technology Overlord` pictured here. Others do not. Their titles are tinsel [@shelley] but I'm grateful for what they taught me, whatever their title. This chapter acknowledges some of them. [PLNS figure](https://bryanmmathers.com/plns/) from an thought by [tomwhitby.com](https://tomwhitby.com) via [Aaron Davis](https://readwriterespond.com) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

## Thank you students {#studentsagain}
Thanks again to all the students who've contributed to this book, directly or indirectly described in section \@ref(students).

::: {.rmdnote}
(ref:codingcomment)

These acknowledgements are really looooooong because I try to practice what I preach about the importance of expressing gratitude, see section \@ref(lays). It also serves as a live demonstration of a (public) [gratitude journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal). Expressing gratitude, publicly and privately, is a simple and proven technique for improving your mental health. It will also improve the mental health of the people who you thank, and strengthen the communities that you are part of, see \@ref(signposts3).

## Thank you employers {#employers}

Thanks to all the organisations who have employed students from the Department of Computer Science as either summer interns, year long placements or graduates. A big chunk of this guidebook documents their experience of employers and their graduate recruitment programs.

<!--use mutate here e.g. https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/14-->

Thanks to Niall Beard and [Sharif Salah](https://github.com/sharifsalah) at Google for introducing me to Google's Technical Writing course in section \@ref(techwriting). Writing is rewriting!

So, thanks employers for employing our students. üôè

## Thank you colleagues {#colleagues}
I've also had significant support from colleagues in the Department of Computer Science , and many other parts of the University: (engineering, natural sciences, social sciences, biology, medicine and health etc) and support staff at the University of Manchester: Careers service and Alumni office.

Thank you [Carole Goble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Goble) for building the community that supported me through postgraduate study. Thanks for creating the environment which this book was written in, especially the [e-Science lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/), Information Management Group (IMG), Software Sustainability Institute ([software.ac.uk](https://software.ac.uk/)) and their spin-offs. Thanks for patiently re-teaching me how to write better by covering early drafts of my Masters thesis in red ink and less patiently (on subsequent revisions) swear words. ü§¨

Thank you [Steve Furber](https://www.cdyf.me/steve) for playing guitar in our ‚Äúboy band‚Äù [Tuning Complete](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/research#tuningcomplete), see chapter \@ref(steve). All we've got is your bass guitar, [three chords and the truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Chords_and_the_Truth). [@harlan; @allalongthewatchtower] üé∏

Thank you [Jim Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_John_Miles) for encouraging me to write a book shortly after you offered me a job. I thought you were joking (about the book) but it actually turned out to be another one of your great ideas. Thanks Jim. üôè

I'd also like to thank the only three people in the whole world who've had the ~~misfortune~~ pleasure of reading all of my PhD thesis cover to cover; [Robert Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_David_Stevens), [Anil Wipat](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/anil.wipat/) and [Steve Pettifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Pettifer). I suspect it was as painful for you to read as it was for me to write it. Thanks Robert for your relentless patience and giving me a well timed, well aimed kick up the (proverbial) arse to write this book in the [Midland Hotel, Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Hotel,_Manchester) at the May ball.

So, thank you colleagues for being collegiate. You make the University of Manchester an enjoyable place to work.

(ref:captionhitch) Optimists will tell you that ‚Äúeveryone has a book in them...‚Äù, but pessimists like [Christopher Hitchens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens) will add that ‚Äú...in most cases that's exactly where it should remain‚Äù.

So thanks academics for being even more sceptical than Christopher Hitchens, see figure \@ref(fig:hitchens-fig). Thanks academics for being academic. üôè

In the heart of [Thomas Hardy's Wessex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy%27s_Wessex), Shaftesbury has been used as a location for several films including a screen adaptation of *[Far from the Madding Crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_from_the_Madding_Crowd)* [@farfrom] and *the* [Hovis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hovis) advert, one of Britain's best-loved adverts [@hovisadvert].

Why not serve your local community as a ‚Äú[critical friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_friend)‚Äù on the governing board of a school?

Situated between the [Yamuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamuna) and [Ganges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges), the institute was founded in 1963 by the late Reverend Eliyah Thsetsan Phuntsog in [Ladakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladakh), [Jammu & Kashmir state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(state)) to provide education for [Tibetan refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_diaspora) fleeing from their homeland across the Himalayas.

## Thank you Bryan {#visualthinkery}
Many of the illustrations for this book have been drawn by the very talented Bryan Mathers shown in figure \@ref(fig:tedx-galway-vid).

Bryan is an artist, visual thinker, entrepreneur and listener who turns stories into pictures. He also happens to have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Glasgow. As a [renaissance man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_man), his combined skills in art, science and engineering made him the perfect fit for illustrating this guidebook. You can find out more about Bryan at [bryanmathers.com](https://bryanmmathers.com) and [visualthinkery.com](https://visualthinkery.com). I'm very glad we randomly bumped into each other at the `#wikiedu20` conference: [wikiedusummit.coventry.domains](https://wikiedusummit.coventry.domains/).

## Thank you NHS {#thxnhs}

[Thank you NHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_You_NHS) for all the healthcare you've provided for me and my family from our cradles to our graves, see figure \@ref(fig:nhs-fig). I had taken your services for granted until I thought I was on my deathbed, see section \@ref(regrets). Thankfully, I was granted some extra ‚Äú[Fergie time](https://bbc.in/3Puj3PV)‚Äù from the [Grim Reaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(personification)). [@fergietime] ‚ò†Ô∏è

(ref:captionnhs) [Thank you NHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_You_NHS) started in during the COVID-19 pandemic when people in the UK posted messages of gratitude for their [National Health Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service) (NHS), to acknowledge their crucial work.

So, thanks NHS ‚ù§Ô∏è for all the publicly funded healthcare. üôè
