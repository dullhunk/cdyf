# Actioning your future {#actioning}

Employers are often more interested in what you have *done*, rather than what you just *know*. Your actions are a key part of your story we discussed in section \@ref(care). A simple technique for emphasising the `action` in your stories is to lead  descriptions of your projects, education and experience with carefully chosen `verbs`, see section \@ref(verbsfirst) for examples.

## Your actions define your impact {#impact}
Your actions define your impact, see figure \@ref(fig:action-fig). What stories you can tell of your actions to date? What verbs best describe how you achieved a result or had an impact? What was the context, action, result and evidence (CARE) we discussed in section \@ref(care) of each (short) story?

```{r action-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionactions)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/your-actions.png")
```
(ref:captionactions) What action have you taken and what stories can you tell about the results and your impact? What are the best verbs for highlighting your actions?

By leading with verbs you will highlight what you have *actually done* and how you did it, rather than what you know. See the verbs first section \@ref(verbsfirst) of chapter \@ref(debugging) *debugging your future*.

## What you will learn {#ilo17}

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

1. Emphasise your *actions* when describing your education, projects and experience
1. Reflect on
    + what skills you already have
    + what skills you need to develop
1. Demonstrate those skills explicitly and quickly in job applications

## Breakpoints {#bp17}
(ref:breakpoint)

```md
* PAUSE ⏸️
```

Quickly scan your CV, covering letter or application form for VERBS:

* Where are the verbs?
    + buried deep in long sections of prose? **OR**
    + prominently leading descriptions of your activities?
* Have you over-used certain verbs (like `worked` or `assisted` for example) or been repetitive (like over-using `developed` see alternatives in section \@ref(engineering))
* How can you increase the variety of verbs you have used (without exaggerating or lying)?
* Which verbs are stronger than others and why?
* Are there any categories of verbs you can't provide evidence for, such as leadership (see section \@ref(leading)) or influencing (see section \@ref(influencing))?
    + What activities or projects could you do that would help you develop these missing skills?

## Summarising your actions
(ref:tldr)

Actions speak louder than words, or as suffragette and political activist [Emmeline Pankhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst) frequently said “Deeds not Words”, see figure \@ref(fig:pankhurst-fig). Your CV needs to emphasise your deeds and actions using words. Those words are `verbs`.

```{r pankhurst-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionpankhurst)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/deeds-not-words-pankhurst.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionpankhurst) “Deeds not words” was the rallying cry of suffragette [Emmeline Pankhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst). Emphasise the deeds (actions) on your CV by leading your stories with carefully chosen `verbs`.

Leading with `verbs` is a simple but powerful technique that enables you to provide evidence (rather than assertion) for the skills and knowledge you have. Choose your `verbs` carefully. Which verbs are missing from your CV? These verbs can help you identify gaps in your professional and personal development.
