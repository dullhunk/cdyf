## Where can you for look for jobs? {#looking}

The marketplace for job searching and job hunting advice is incredibly crowded. Employers spend huge amounts of money recruiting staff and this is reflected in the enormous range of job websites, which are often accompanied by advice on job hunting. I've broken resources down here into three categories, student specific, more general resources and recruiters.

### Student and graduate specific resources {#studentjobs}

These resources are specifically aimed at undergraduate students and graduates:

* [gradcracker.com](http://www.gradcracker.com/) for engineering and technology students, you can filter e.g. by [Computing/Technology jobs](https://www.gradcracker.com/search/computing-technology/jobs), from the publishers of the popular [gradcracker toolkit](http://www.gradcracker.com/career-centre/toolkit)
*  [ratemyplacement.co.uk](http://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/) is a leading UK job resource for undergraduates seeking placements and internships.
* [targetjobs.co.uk](http://www.targetjobs.co.uk/) graduate jobs, schemes and internships from the people behind [The Guardian 300 top graduate employers](https://targetjobs.co.uk/uk300)
* [milkround.com](http://www.milkround.com/), placements and graduate positions from the people behind [The Times Top 100 Graduate employers](https://digital.top100graduateemployers.com/view/153459/)
*  [graduateland.com](https://graduateland.com/), placements and graduate positions around Europe
*  [prospects.ac.uk](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/), a jobs board accompanied by job searching advice
* [InsideCareers.co.uk](https://www.insidecareers.co.uk) is good if you're looking for jobs in the  financial sector
* [varsitycareershub.co.uk](https://www.varsitycareershub.co.uk/), targeting students from [Loxbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxbridge) but many of the employers recruit much more widely
*  [Year in Industry](https://www.etrust.org.uk/yini-vacancies) if you're looking for a year in industry
* Your University careers service, e.g. if you're studying at the University of Manchester it's [careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk](https://careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk/). University jobs boards are good places to look for opportunities that are specifically targeted at the University where you are studying

### More general resources {#generaljobs}

These resources are aimed at a wider audience (not just students and graduates) but are useful nonetheless.

* Google job search aggregates content from many ([but not all](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44853472)) of the sources listed above. You can use google job search use to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven't used it already try the searches below. Unlike other sites, Google job search works by indexing embedded [microdata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)) based on [schema.org/JobPosting](https://schema.org/JobPosting). Keywords like `job`, `intern` and `placement` in an regular google search will trigger the job search product:

    -[google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester](https://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester)

    -[google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern](https://www.google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern)

    -[google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer](https://www.google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer)

    -[google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london](https://www.google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london)

    -[google.com/search?q=data+scientist+placement](https://www.google.com/search?q=data+scientist+placement)

    -If you're looking for a job AT google, they have moved from [jobs.google.com](https://jobs.google.com/about/) to [careers.google.com](https://careers.google.com/)

* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) advertises job vacancies, is [frequently visited by recruiters](https://blog.linkedin.com/2016/10/06/now-you-can-privately-signal-to-recruiters-youre-open-to-new-job) and you can often [apply for jobs directly on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/75815/applying-for-jobs-on-linkedin?lang=en) (athough [making fast applications is not always a good thing](https://medium.com/otta-blog/job-boards-making-fast-applications-is-not-a-good-thing-5a4970887ecd)). See [university.linkedin.com/linkedin-for-students](https://university.linkedin.com/linkedin-for-students) and [linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students)
* [glassdoor.co.uk](http://www.glassdoor.co.uk/) is like tripadvisor for jobs. Find out what it's *really* like to work for given employers from current and former employees. A student oriented version can be found at [glassdoor.com/Students](https://www.glassdoor.com/Students), this means you can use it without writing a review of a previous employer (which is what non-student users have to do to access the content)
*  [HiPEAC jobs](https://www.hipeac.net/jobs) (High Performance and Embedded Architecture and Compilation) is good for jobs in hardware, supercomputing and related fields
*  [Indeed.co.uk](http://www.indeed.co.uk), [adzuna.co.uk](https://www.adzuna.co.uk), [cwjobs.co.uk](https://www.cwjobs.co.uk/), [fish4.co.uk](https://www.fish4.co.uk), [reed.co.uk](https://www.reed.co.uk/), [totaljobs.com](https://www.totaljobs.com), [monster.co.uk](https://www.monster.co.uk), [jobs.smartrecruiters.com](https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com), [workinstartups.com](https://workinstartups.com), [cv-library.co.uk](https://www.cv-library.co.uk), [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk) are general jobs boards that also advertise jobs for students and graduates, alongside many other vacancies.
*  [stackoverflow.com/jobs](http://stackoverflow.com/jobs) jobs via StackOverflow. You've cut and pasted the code... they advertise technical vacancies too
* [Otta.com](https://otta.com/) for people with 0-10 years experience. From engineering to sales, discover jobs & internships at London\'s most innovative companies.

### Recruiters {#recruiters}

Recruiters can help you find work and they operate in every industry sector. There are two basic kinds of recruiters that can help you:

1. Recruiters employed directly by an employer, for example in the human resources (HR) department of a given organisation.
1. Recruiters who are self-employed or work for a recruitment agency. They typically earn money from the number of interview candidates and successful hires they provide for their clients.

Recruiters are not always technical people, so don't expect them to have lots of knowledge about software engineering (for example) - that isn't usually their skill set. Although recruiters can help you, it is worth being wary of recruiters as shown in figure \@ref(fig:recruiter-fig), especially if they work for an agency rather than being directly employed by the organisation you are interested in.

```{r recruiter-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionrecruiter)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/recruiters-are.png")
```
(ref:captionrecruiter) The autocomplete algorithm of a well known search engine gives you an idea of what *some* people think about *some* recruiters. This doesn't mean you should avoid recruiters, just be careful how you use them.

Some recruiters are very good and can help you. For example, there are some recruitment agencies that specialise in helping employers recruit graduates, these may be useful to you. However some recruiters are not very good, and don't provide a valued service for employers or potential employees like you. This is why you sometimes see `no recruiters` or `no agencies` on job adverts. So be wary of recruiters, but it is worth remembering that some recruiters work primarily for their clients (employers) not you.

## Job search strategies

It is a good idea to have a range of different strategies for job hunting, and change the strategy during the year. Before we look at strategies, it's important to realise that when you're reading job descriptions for vacancies, some employers will over state their requirements in the hope they get their dream candidate. You might look at the job description and think, I've only got 70% of what they're asking for, so I won't bother applying. The truth is, if you've got 75% of what they are asking for, you should definitely apply.

### Over specified job descriptions
Employers and recruiters routinely over-specify job descriptions. A good example of this is, when the [Swift programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) was released in 2014 at the [Apple Worldwide Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference) (WWDC) in California, job adverts instantly appeared asking for programmers with `5 years experience in Swift`! How can *anyone* have five years experience in a programming language that's only just been made public?! Aside from the people who developed the language, like [Chris Lattner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner), the recruiters and employers are going to have *long* search trying to find their unicorn. It will probably take them at least five years! 🦄

```{r iamdevloper-fig,echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Job interview: sort binary tree. Job: manually update csv files ... We're looking for someone aged 22-26 with 30 years of experience "}
library(tweetrmd)
include_tweet("https://twitter.com/Mubeeen_/status/1288115932154363905")
```

The moral of the Apple story above is, if you don't meet all the criteria on a job spec, that shouldn't stop you applying. Most job specifications are over-specified as wishful employers dream up their ideal candidate.

At the beginning of the academic year in September you might target large multinational organisations. If you're not successful, you can switch to smaller employers later in the academic year. Table \@ref(tab:shortcuts) shows summarises some of the when and where some employers advertise.

```{r shortcuts, echo = FALSE}
job_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ ""       , ~ "Large corporations", ~ "SMEs",
  "Where"    , "Advertise broadly", "Less likely to advertise on big jobs boards",
  "When"     , "Vacancies earlier in the academic year", "Vacancies tend to be later in the academic year",
  "Type"     , "Unlikely to consider speculative applications", "May consider speculative or informal applications",
  "How"      , "Multistage applications, several rounds of interviews", "Shorter application processes"
)
knitr::kable(job_table, caption = "Where, when and how to apply for vacancies, internships, placements, graduate jobs and schemes in large multinational corporations and small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs)", booktabs = TRUE)
```


## Breakpoints

Take a pause and check the values of your parameters and variables. Here are some [breakpoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint) for reflection and discussion:

* How many jobs should you apply for?  
* Why is it important to build your network?
* How can recruiters help you?
* Why do recruiters have a bad reputation?
* How long does it take to apply for a job?
* Should I optimise for *quality* or *quantity* of job applications?
* How can you deal with the inevitable rejections that come during job hunting?


## The power of weak ties {#weakties}

Your close network probably won't change that much, the friends and family you trust and rely on. Its important to recognise the importance of more casual acquaintances, or what sociologist [Mark Granovetter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter) calls  “weak ties”. [@granovetter]

```{r bumped-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbumped)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Bumped into.png")
```
(ref:captionbumped) It's not what you know, its who you know. Networking is an essential part of any job search, your networks can help you now and in the future. One of the things looked at in this chapter is how to build and use your networks to help find the job you're after. The simplest networking technique is bumping into people, but you need create opportunities for that to happen.

 Weak ties are people you don't know as well, but are important for a range of reasons. Research has shown that [building networks of weak ties is good for your mental health and can give you an edge in job hunting](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-why-your-weak-tie-friendships-may-mean-more-than-you-think). [@weakties] Granovetter showed that many job opportunities came through weak ties, rather than strong ones. This is true not just of jobs early on in your career (like now) but also later too. So it is in your interests to continually foster weak connections and be open to serendipitous meetings where you bump into people, as in Figure \@ref(fig:bumped-fig). “Bumping into” here, could mean either physical or virtual.

```{r net-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionnetworks)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/grow your networks.png")
```

(ref:captionnetworks) Who is in your network? Grow and use your network, both the strong ties and the weak ties. Weak ties are often the most important when it comes to job hunting.

<!--### Academics

Academics have careers too, and some will have extensive networks of contacts in industry and academia that might be useful to you. If you ask nicely, they might introduce you to people they know who can help, such as former students or collaborators.

```{r teachers-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionpurveyors)"}
