## Where can you for look for jobs? {#looking}

The marketplace for job searching and job hunting advice is incredibly crowded. Employers spend huge amounts of money on recruitment and this is reflected in the enormous range of job websites, which are often accompanied by advice on job hunting. I've broken resources down here into three categories, student specific, more general resources and recruiters. Before we look at those, we need to define some terms.

### Job terminology {#jobterms}
Employers use terms to describe jobs for undergraduates and graduates inconsistently. In this book we use the following terms shown in Table \@ref(tab:jobterms).

```{r jobterms, echo = FALSE}
jobterm_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ "Name", ~ "Employment contract",
  "Insight", "Usually no contract. One to three weeks, sometimes known as work experience, work shadowing, spring weeks, vacation schemes or even [externships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externship). Usually unpaid, but often expensed. See [ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights](https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights) for some examples",
  "Internship", "Fixed term contract, typically 3 months full-time over summer, but anywhere between 1 and 6 months. Sometimes part-time, *may* be an assessed part of an undergraduate or postgraduate degree.",
  "Placement", "Fixed term contract, typically 12 months long and an assessed part of a degree. In Europe they are sometimes known as “sandwich” years because they typically take place somewhere around the middle of a degree. In America, placements are usually [known as co-ops](https://career.vt.edu/experience/ceip/ceip-internship-coop.html)",
  "Graduate job", "Full-time permanent contract typically working in one department of an organisation",
  "Graduate scheme", "Full-time permanent contract. Fast-track or high-flier managerial scheme, in your first two years, you'll probably rotate around different departments in an organisation"
)
knitr::kable(jobterm_table, caption = "Terms used in this guidebook to describe employment opportunities for undergraduates and graduates", booktabs = TRUE)
```
Now that we've defined terms for jobs we can look at resources for finding them.

### Student and graduate specific resources {#studentjobs}

The following job finding resources are specifically aimed at undergraduate students and graduates:

* [gradcracker.com](http://www.gradcracker.com/) for engineering and technology students, you can filter e.g. by [Computing/Technology jobs](https://www.gradcracker.com/search/computing-technology/jobs), from the publishers of the popular [gradcracker toolkit](http://www.gradcracker.com/career-centre/toolkit)
*  [ratemyplacement.co.uk](http://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/) is a leading UK job resource for undergraduates seeking placements and internships.
* [targetjobs.co.uk](http://www.targetjobs.co.uk/) graduate jobs, schemes and internships from the people behind [The Guardian 300 top graduate employers](https://targetjobs.co.uk/uk300)
* [milkround.com](http://www.milkround.com/), placements and graduate positions from the people behind [The Times Top 100 Graduate employers](https://digital.top100graduateemployers.com/view/153459/)
*  [graduateland.com](https://graduateland.com/), placements and graduate positions around Europe
*  [prospects.ac.uk](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/), a jobs board accompanied by job searching advice
* [InsideCareers.co.uk](https://www.insidecareers.co.uk) is good if you're looking for jobs in the  financial sector
* [varsitycareershub.co.uk](https://www.varsitycareershub.co.uk/), targeting students from [Loxbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxbridge) but many of the employers recruit much more widely
*  [Year in Industry](https://www.etrust.org.uk/yini-vacancies) if you're looking for a year in industry
* Your University careers service, e.g. if you're studying at the University of Manchester it's [careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk](https://careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk/user/jobs.html). University jobs boards are good places to look for opportunities that are specifically targeted at students of the University where you are studying.

### More general resources {#generaljobs}

The following job finding resources are aimed at a wider audience (not just students and graduates) but are useful nonetheless.

* Google job search indexes jobs advertised by many of the resources mentioned in this chapter. You can use google job search use to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven't used it already try the searches below. Unlike other sites, Google job search works by indexing embedded [microdata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)) based on [schema.org/JobPosting](https://schema.org/JobPosting). Keywords like `job`, `intern` and `placement` in an regular google search will trigger the job search product:

    -[google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester](https://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester)

    -[google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern](https://www.google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern)

    -[google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer](https://www.google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer)

    -[google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london](https://www.google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london)

    -[google.com/search?q=data+scientist+placement](https://www.google.com/search?q=data+scientist+placement)

    -Google job search is an impressive product, but it doesn't index *everything*. See [Google's job hunting service comes to UK](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44853472) [@noindeed] If you're looking for a job AT google, they have moved from [jobs.google.com](https://jobs.google.com/about/) to [careers.google.com](https://careers.google.com/), see also section \@ref(bignames)

* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) advertises job vacancies, is [frequently visited by recruiters](https://blog.linkedin.com/2016/10/06/now-you-can-privately-signal-to-recruiters-youre-open-to-new-job) and you can often [apply for jobs directly on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/75815/applying-for-jobs-on-linkedin?lang=en) (athough [making fast applications is not always a good thing](https://medium.com/otta-blog/job-boards-making-fast-applications-is-not-a-good-thing-5a4970887ecd)). See [university.linkedin.com/linkedin-for-students](https://university.linkedin.com/linkedin-for-students) and [linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students)
* [glassdoor.co.uk](http://www.glassdoor.co.uk/) is like tripadvisor for jobs. Find out what it's *really* like to work for given employers from current and former employees. A student oriented version can be found at [glassdoor.com/Students](https://www.glassdoor.com/Students), this means you can use it without writing a review of a previous employer (which is what non-student users have to do to access the content)
*  [HiPEAC jobs](https://www.hipeac.net/jobs) (High Performance and Embedded Architecture and Compilation) is good for jobs in hardware, supercomputing and related fields
*  [Indeed.co.uk](http://www.indeed.co.uk), [adzuna.co.uk](https://www.adzuna.co.uk), [cwjobs.co.uk](https://www.cwjobs.co.uk/), [fish4.co.uk](https://www.fish4.co.uk), [reed.co.uk](https://www.reed.co.uk/), [totaljobs.com](https://www.totaljobs.com), [monster.co.uk](https://www.monster.co.uk), [jobs.smartrecruiters.com](https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com), [workinstartups.com](https://workinstartups.com), [cv-library.co.uk](https://www.cv-library.co.uk), [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk) are general jobs boards that also advertise jobs for students and graduates, alongside many other vacancies.
*  [stackoverflow.com/jobs](http://stackoverflow.com/jobs) jobs via StackOverflow. You've cut and pasted the code... they advertise technical vacancies too
* [Otta.com](https://otta.com/) for people with 0-10 years experience. From engineering to sales, discover jobs & internships at London\'s most innovative companies.

### Recruiters {#recruiters}

Recruiters can help you find work and they operate in every industry sector. They are sometimes called “head-hunters”, and there are two basic kinds that can help you:

1. Recruiters employed directly by an employer, for example in the human resources (HR) department of a given organisation.
1. Recruiters who are self-employed or work for a recruitment agency. They typically earn money from the number of interview candidates and successful hires they provide for their clients.

Recruiters are usually not technical people, so don't expect them to have lots of knowledge about software engineering (for example) - that isn't usually their skill set. Although recruiters can help you, it is worth being wary of recruiters as shown in figure \@ref(fig:recruiter-fig), especially if they work for an agency rather than being directly employed by the organisation you are interested in.

```{r recruiter-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionrecruiter)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/recruiters-are.png")
```
(ref:captionrecruiter) The autocomplete algorithm of a well known search engine gives you an idea of what *some* people think about *some* recruiters. This doesn't mean you should avoid recruiters, just be careful how you use them.

Some recruiters are very good and can help you. For example, there are some recruitment agencies that specialise in helping employers recruit graduates, these may be useful to you. However some recruiters are not very good, and don't provide a valued service for employers or potential employees like you. This is why you sometimes see `no recruiters` or `no agencies` on job adverts. So be wary of recruiters, and remember that some recruiters work primarily for their clients (employers) not you.

In most cases you shouldn't have to pay recruiters up front but job scammers will sometimes pose as recruiters so beware. Talking of job scammers, there's some things you need to be wary of when you are job hunting:

## Buyer beware {#beware}
When you're looking for job you're acting as both a buyer *and* a seller.

1. **SELLING**: You're selling your services in a marketplace, for the best price you can get
1. **BUYING**: You're buying into the culture and values of an employer, who are trying to sell themselves to you.

When you’re buying, you should be wary of the following:

### Beware of the job scammers {#scams}
Most job adverts are legitimate but you are vulnerable when you are job hunting. You may become more vulnerable over time if you are getting repeated rejections (remember: repeated rejection is quite normal). Unfortunately there are some shady characters out there looking to exploit your vulnerability through various kinds of [employment fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_fraud). [@jobscammers] You should be wary of anyone asking you for:

* Money up front - be very suspicious
* Excessive personal data such birth dates, passport numbers and bank details. These could be used for identity theft, fraud or other criminal activities
* See for example [google.com/search?q=job+scams](https://www.google.com/search?q=job+scams)

Reputable employers (and jobs boards) will not try to scam you, but you should beware of job scammers if you find yourself looking for employment off the beaten track.

### Beware of over-specified jobs {#overspec}
Employers and recruiters routinely over-specify job descriptions. A good example of this is, when the [Swift programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) was released in 2014 at the [Apple Worldwide Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference) (WWDC) in California, job adverts instantly appeared asking for programmers with `5 years experience in Swift`! How can *anyone* have five years experience in a programming language that's only just been made public?! Aside from the people who developed the language, like [Chris Lattner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner), the recruiters and employers must have had a *long* search trying to find their candidate. It must have taken them at least five years!

```{r iamdevloper-fig,echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Job interview: sort binary tree. Job: manually update csv files ... We're looking for someone aged 22-26 with 30 years of experience "}
library(tweetrmd)
include_tweet("https://twitter.com/Mubeeen_/status/1288115932154363905")
```

The moral of this Apple story above is, if you don't meet *all* the criteria in a job specification, that shouldn't stop you applying. Most job specifications are over-specified as wishful employers dream up their ideal candidate.^[Using a relationship analogy, describe your ideal romantic partner. PAUSE. How many people are actually likely to have ALL of those attributes?] Many employers will over state their requirements in the hope they get their dream candidate. You might look at the job description and think, I've only got 70% of what they're asking for, so I won't bother applying. The reality is, if you've got 60% of what they are asking for, you should definitely apply. It's unlikely that *anyone* will meet 100% of the job requirements.

If you see things on job adverts you don't understand or are not sure about, go and find out about them. There's a good chance it will be similar to something you already know about, or can self-educate yourself to fill any gaps.

### Beware of unpaid internships {#unpaid}
In the United Kingdom, it is illegal to employ people without paying them a salary. However, there are exceptions which can allow employers to take on unpaid interns depending on how they classify their employment status. See for example:

* Employment rights and pay for interns [gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns](https://www.gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns)
* Targetjobs position on [the law on unpaid internships: know your rights ](https://targetjobs.co.uk/internships/advice/275017-the-law-on-unpaid-internships-know-your-rights)
* RateMyPlacement article: [Why I Regret Doing an Unpaid Internship](https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/blog/why-i-regret-doing-an-unpaid-internship/)
* For more horror stories see [google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships](https://www.google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships)

In science, technology and engineering, unpaid internships are much less common than in other sectors as demand for skilled engineers and scientists is generally high. Some employers, particularly startups, may offer company equity (e.g. shares) as an alternative to a salary - again you should be wary of this. Like many people, I don't endorse unpaid internships, and I recommend you avoid them completely. They are a form of modern slavery.

### Beware of overselling {#oversell}
When people try to sell you things, you should be wary of overselling and fake news shown in figure \@ref(fig:fakenews-fig).

```{r fakenews-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfakenews)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fakenews.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionfakenews) Beware of fake news in the jobs marketplace. Are employers *really* as good as they say they are? Are *you* as good as you say you are? Public domain cartoon by Frederick Burr Opper via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3KKt](https://w.wiki/3KKt)

There's two kinds of overselling that are common in the jobs marketplace:

1. Employers overselling themselves. Recruitment can be a beauty contest, with everyone trying to show you their best side. Some employers may make promises they can't deliver but a quick look on sites like [glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com) will help you evaluate employers. Even better, talk directly with actual employees of the organisation, both current and former. Is their employer really as good as they say they are?
1. You exaggerate your achievements: It can be tempting to overstate your case to sell your services in the marketplace. An experienced reader or interviewer will be able to spot your fake news and find you out, see chapter \@ref(debugging) *debugging your future*

You should be wary of both. Likewise, you should make sure you don't undersell yourself. Know your value (financial), know who you are and try to understand how that fits with a given employer. It is easy to find out about salaries, for example see [technical intern salaries in the UK](https://github.com/IgWod/interns-salaries-uk-2018) [@igwod] and [graduate salaries in the UK](https://luminate.prospects.ac.uk/graduate-salaries-in-the-uk). [@michaelgrove] Salaries in the UK for interns range from [minimum wage](https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage) to £50k, with everything in between.

### Beware of rejection {#rejection}
Repeated rejections are a normal part of applying for jobs. They can take a heavy toll on your mental health described in chapter \@ref(nurturing) and for most people, it's a struggle. Some employers won't even bother to reply to reject you, welcome to the black hole described in section \@ref(blackhole) and shown in figure \@ref(fig:blackhole-fig).

```{r blackhole-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionblackhole)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/blackhole.jpg")
```

(ref:captionblackhole) Rejection is a normal part of applying for jobs, some of your applications may disappear without trace into employers “black holes”, especially if they are large and have a strong gravitational force on job applicants. CC-BY image of the black hole in [Messier 87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87) by the [Event Horizon Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Horizon_Telescope) team via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3RCa](https://w.wiki/3RCa)


If you're getting too many rejections or all your applications are sucked into black holes, it might be because:

* you need to debug your CV again, see chapter \@ref(debugging)
* you need to change your job search strategy

So, lets looks at job search strategies you can use.

## Job search strategies {#strategies}
Now that you're aware of some pitfalls you need to think about developing a range of different strategies for job hunting, and change the strategy during the year. At the beginning of the academic year in September you might target large multinational organisations. If you're not successful, you could switch to smaller employers later in the academic year. Table \@ref(tab:shortcuts) shows summarises some of the when and where some employers advertise.

```{r shortcuts, echo = FALSE}
job_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ ""       , ~ "Large corporations", ~ "SMEs",
  "Where"    , "Advertise broadly", "Less likely to advertise on big jobs boards",
  "When"     , "Vacancies earlier in the academic year", "Vacancies tend to be later in the academic year",
  "Type"     , "Unlikely to consider speculative applications", "May consider speculative or informal applications",
  "How"      , "Multistage applications, several rounds of interviews", "Shorter application processes"
)
knitr::kable(job_table, caption = "Where, when and how to apply for vacancies, internships, placements, graduate jobs and schemes in large multinational corporations and small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs)", booktabs = TRUE)
```


## Breakpoints

Take a pause and check the values of your parameters and variables. Here are some [breakpoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint) for reflection and discussion:

* How many jobs should you apply for?  
* Why is it important to build your network?
* How can recruiters help you?
* Why do recruiters have a bad reputation?
* How long does it take to apply for a job?
* Should I optimise for *quality* or *quantity* of job applications?
* How can you deal with the inevitable rejections that come during job hunting?


## The power of weak ties {#weakties}

Your close network probably won't change that much, the friends and family you trust and rely on. Its important to recognise the importance of more casual acquaintances, or what sociologist [Mark Granovetter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter) calls  “weak ties”. [@granovetter]

```{r bumped-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbumped)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Bumped into.png")
```
(ref:captionbumped) It's not what you know, its who you know. Networking is an essential part of any job search, your networks can help you now and in the future. One of the things looked at in this chapter is how to build and use your networks to help find the job you're after. The simplest networking technique is bumping into people, but you need create opportunities for that to happen. Bumped into sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

 Weak ties are people you don't know as well, but are important for a range of reasons. Research has shown that [building networks of weak ties is good for your mental health and can give you an edge in job hunting](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-why-your-weak-tie-friendships-may-mean-more-than-you-think). [@weakties] Granovetter showed that many job opportunities came through weak ties, rather than strong ones. This is true not just of jobs early on in your career (like now) but also later too. So it is in your interests to continually foster weak connections and be open to serendipitous meetings where you bump into people, as in Figure \@ref(fig:bumped-fig). “Bumping into” here, could mean either physical or virtual.

```{r net-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionnetworks)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/grow your networks.png")
```

(ref:captionnetworks) Who is in your network? Grow and use your network, both the strong ties and the weak ties. Weak ties are often the most important when it comes to job hunting.

<!--### Academics

Academics have careers too, and some will have extensive networks of contacts in industry and academia that might be useful to you. If you ask nicely, they might introduce you to people they know who can help, such as former students or collaborators.

<!--
It is no secret that, when applying for placements and graduate jobs, you are likely to submit multiple applications before being offered a role. In response to rejections, students are often encouraged to ‘be resilient’ and ‘keep trying’ – but there’s a lot more to it than that.

While it’s important to bounce back from rejection and keep applying to opportunities, churning out one application after another in the name of resilience isn’t always productive. It is more important that you are taking steps to minimise rejection and increase your chances of success. And there are several ways that you can do this.

Don’t take a scattergun approach

You are more likely to be successful sending out five targeted, tailored applications than twenty untailored applications for roles you do not meet all the requirements for. So, my first piece of advice is to create targeted applications for opportunities you have a reasonable chance of getting (i.e. you meet all the necessary criteria).

You’ll need to tailor each application to the employer and the role, detailing why you are interested in the opportunity and giving examples of what makes you the best person for the job. This will ensure that the applications you do send out are of a high quality.

Learn from feedback

If you’re unsuccessful at interview, make use of any feedback to identify areas for improvement. It’s important that you are self-critical and that you don’t take rejection personally. Acknowledge what you did well and improve on what you could have done better, so that your next application has a greater chance of success.

Create a schedule

Set yourself a reasonable target for the number of applications you are going to submit each week. It’s important that this target is realistic for you, so be sure to factor in your other responsibilities and priorities.

Designating a specific time to work on your applications should help you stay focused and motivated. It’s also likely to safeguard against burnout; in other words, it’ll stop you from overworking yourself, which doesn’t usually do much for the quality of your work.

Moreover, working to a schedule means you’ll have ongoing applications at different stages. If you receive a rejection from one application, you’re likely to have others in progress, which should help you stay motivated and remain optimistic.

Keep an open mind

Try to think laterally when choosing which opportunities to apply for. It can be tempting to apply to companies which you are already familiar with, and while there are lots of advantages of working for large, well-known organisations, there are just as many benefits to working for medium-sized companies and SMEs that you perhaps might not have heard of.

By considering the full range of companies on Gradcracker, you open yourself up to more opportunities, and more chances of success.

Equally, don’t just go for the opportunities that are directly related to your degree discipline. As a STEM student, your transferable skills make you highly sought after in a diverse range of sectors and roles, so try to keep an open mind when searching for opportunities.

Now, it’s time to try again!
I hope these steps help you to bounce back from rejection – but also to prevent rejection and increase your chances of success.-->
