So um, welcome Robert, thank you for coming on. Thank you. Uh, let's start with well can you say a little bit about who you are? Um and hadn't came to be here. Well I I Robert Stevens a long long time ago. 1983 to 86. My first degree was in biochemistry.

And for some reasons, we'll come on to, I ended up in computer science, then postdocs lectureship. Trailed through senior lecturer reader Professor and then head of Department and then returning to be a, just another member of staff. And then retirement that that's the timeline Lori. So and that you actually retired on Friday.

So yes. Uh well, it actually Sunday technically So, can we go back to the beginning? And so, um, You're studying what a levels were you studying? And what how did you come to choose biochemistry as a degree? So I did maths pure statistics uh biology and chemistry a level.

Yeah, I've always I always just loved biology. It's one of those subjects that I could just do. I just didn't have to try. I've got A's at O level and a level and revised for neither of them really because I, I could just do I just loved it. Yeah, I went to do biochemistry so partly because it was a mixture of biology.

And chemistry is so sort of ignoring physics. You know, is the basis of all life. It's the Machinery. Your cells are just beautiful little assemblies of proteins, made out of, you know, 21 odd. Amino acids that would just make these beautiful little molecular machines. Yeah. Wushi and it's the same fundamentally across all of life.

Most definitely fascinating. So was that something that came from teachers at school or is it? Did you have particularly good teachers teaching in biology and chemistry? Or was it? Well, I have to say that my o level chemistry teacher was superb and she was also my mother so it was a bit of Parental influence there.

Well, both my mum and dad were scientists. They were both chemistry teachers but even from an early age, I just loved it. Of, you know fairy stories about children's books. The first two ladybirds though, but I books, I got were insects and other small animals and plants and how they grow.

Yeah, and I was always one, you know, every time we went out he's collecting sticks leaves poking Corners. You know, I just loved it, just did it all the Curiosity. Yes, young man. I suppose. Yes good. Um, And then I said, once you graduated You're making decisions about, you know, you've got to University, you've done your degree.

And they agree. You wish to design your bestie was that always on the cards or was it? This isn't you made after doing the degree. I from, as long ago, as I can remember, I wanted to be a scientist, right? And PhD was the obvious route to that started.

A PhD in molecular biology, Lester. Yeah. Looking at the To find repressor protein, how it bounds the DNA in the in E coli which was NMR and, you know, straightforward molecular biology of the time, six months into that my site went. Yeah. Doing wet. Biology is a bit problematic when you can't see.

Yes. And computers were the obvious thing to do. Yeah, at that point, if you couldn't see Are you using? What was, what kind of competition were you using in the lab were you using? Was there and computational? Because I think in their wet lab, it was all just doing.

My chemistry course, is a Bristol. In my undergraduate degree, we used to computer once to do some plotting of data. And that was it. They had Bristol Jessica, as I was leaving, Mr. Just got hold of an Evelyn's and Sutherland. Uh, protein, prediction voting structure manipulating computer. Yeah, where you try and fit protein sequences to Contour maps of electron, density, and proteins to try and work out.

What the structure was. This is pretty radical. Yeah, up until that point buying counters with the computers have been

Schools Commodore pet, racial, which my mum had brought home for from school, right? So, look at that kind of thing. To look after a one small computer, the one school computer After that, though the the next company trying that was sort of As with a lot of people of my generation was the BBC microcomputer, and there was one in the lab where I was doing like PhD and after my site was going, I got hold of a screen reader, my mum and dad bought four, it happened and could get them on a, on a beater micro or a pet.

No, an external bit of software, right? You had to plug in a speech synthesiser, right? And one of the people in the lab knew quite a lot about computers, and it was someone called Richard Reese, right, who you might remember, who was high up in the teaching? Hierarching, this University?

Oh, right? A few years ago, right? And was the only person in the University, he knew me when I could see right where it was waiting. Fairly, uh, So I played with the BBC micro computer just to sort of learn how to do it. But then so this is uh obviously a tall, not just a tool of curiosity, but this is then an essential well it's a way, it's a mean to an end because I think up until up until computers came around and we're talking to six students.

Yeah, blind people did piano tuning. Working for the rnib. Sociotherapy. Um, so let's be a solicitor. And that was about it otherwise, and it's still true today that 75 of Brushes of blind. People of employable age are unemployed, right? Which is still pretty shocking. But computers. No matter how unaccessible they were at the time.

Offered people a route to do something with their brains? Yeah. Yeah. And I was taught how to program in COBOL. Yeah. At the rnib. Vocational College, in Loughborough by someone who had been Programmer in the 16s a blind person. Yeah. Who could read Punch Cards with his fingers, right?

And uh, read the screen with something called the Opticon, which is a little camera, you moved over the screen and it turned it into a tactile display a vibrating pins, right? So you sort of read the text? Yeah, with your hand running a camera over the screen now, right?

Like the hard way. And then screen readers came around in the first, when, when I started training to be a programmer, blind programmer 286s had just come in. Yeah. And, uh, we thought they were amazing. You're talking Windows, Windows? No windows free windows, free Windows and windows wasn't in excessive graphic user.

Interfaces were a big known up. Yeah, until until my until I got here late 90s, they became much more accessible. Was King was readable because his text, the text and the screen reader didn't have to do anything. Particularly fancy to to tell you what what you were doing. So I was a whis with command lines.

Yeah. Interesting. So And so you've done this, you've obviously changing Virginia career, effectively shifting sideways. I I saw computers as a way that I could continue to do biology right. And even though as they are an IB vocational College, I sort of gained the system because I just wanted experience with computers.

Yeah and to learn how to program even though it was COBOL which Is a business language rather than the scientific language, but programming programmings. Yeah, you know, and then I went to do an MSC in a computational biological computation at York, right? Which was very biological as opposed to molecular Biology, and it was very very math to see.

Um, some stats, yes, stats modelling. Lots of differential equations and all that kind of thing. Feel that kind of thing. And the thing that was really interesting there because I've never been a great mathematician. But the thing that was really operationally interesting is my ability to do math. Was neither better nor worse, having lost my side.

You have a mathematic ability, hadn't changed, but my ability to operationalise. It had changed fundamentally, which comes down to not being able to scribble on a bit of paper. Yeah. And Alistair Edwards York was my sort of personal tutor there partly because he was on the Master's course on the Master's course in, uh, York and he worked in accessibility, so, they sort of coupled it back with me.

And I was talking to him about this and he said, We could probably do something interesting there. Yeah. So he set up uh your Masters project for me which was great. And, uh, it was basically turning latex into synthetic speech so you can read out equations and there's lots of really interesting things going on with how How do you can present?

Complex dense complex information, like, algebra in speech so that it becomes cognitively manageable. So, I did my PhD on that directly, if I remember the same supervised with Aston with Alistar and then that PhD led to a big EU project, which employed me for a post-doc, right? Which was even better because I had a job.

I came to the end of that and I needed a job and I was applying away and getting you know, getting nowhere. I always have a suspicion that you have been quite open about the fact I couldn't see just many people, but Application. Yeah, but I wandered into uh, the common route staff, common route, but York, and my mate, Andy dearden, who was doing a PhD was reading new scientists and he said, yes to do biology, didn't you?

Robert and I said, that's right. He said there's a bunch of people over in Manchester who are looking someone who's both a computer scientist, And those biology do I want to work on a project for ontologies so I said, send me the details then Andy. So I looked up ontology in the dictionary Which was my prep for the interview.

Yeah, yeah and I came when I was interviewed by Carol Goble Norman, Payton and Andy brass, right? And this was that, Ambis project and in 96, are we talking? This will be 96 right? And I started here in February 1997, right? So was that 28 years ago now? Yeah.

So I did that project and it was just You know, that one of those turning points was Bumping into Andy, did it. York computer science, common rooms here. Yes to do biology, didn't you? And it all turns on that. There's something that weighs and there's a certain amount of serendipity inved in.

I think for everything you've just got to take your opportunities where they arise Youngest project transparent access for multiple bioinformatics information systems, which use an ontology as a sort of core of the system, which Captured biology and bioinformatics tools and how they were related and what could be used for what they did query generation.

Which In some ways, the project was ultimately, sort of unsuccessful even though it worked. I always think it was just a bit early if we had had web services and the like, which we got before, five years later, it could have been a whole lot different. But, yeah, we didn't.

But it was a highly influential project. And at the same time, uh, in Horics was doing his PhD, uh, which resulted in fact, Fast. More fact stands for well fast classification of terminologies. Yeah description Logics. Yeah automated reasoning. Which ultimately through oil then daml plus oil led to how.

Yeah. And Alan Rector was big into. Magical ontologies and we in that group, we developed an owl tutorial and Uh, Protege. Al Wage became the sort of and still is a sort of de facto. Ontology bodily told and we developed a tutorial. Yeah. And Folly of the tambis staff and Carol.

We got into doing tutorials and running by ontology workshops which sort of placed me in the centre of the growing interest in. Bio ontologies, which has led to this huge explosion of activity. No, I wouldn't like doing players all down to me at all, much more influential and important people than me.

But doing the sort of training and advocacy for ontologies, put me in a very, very good place. Then you know, for the last 25 years I've just had a laugh really Uh, Doing. And I still think, you know, Articulating. A bunch of axioms about something as complex as biology.

Pressing a button and you out pops this, well, formed Ontology. Yeah, I still find that endlessly. Beautiful. I it's just lovely and they said I mean it was at the time they are looking now at a lot of the generative AI stuff, the piece that's missing in some of them.

Some of it is the reasoning that you're talking about about saying, well, you know, uh, this protein is a phosphatase so therefore, we can refer a lot of things about it. And here's, here's the, the knowledge base that backs up all these assertions, these axioms you're talking about, well, sort of missing in a lot of generative AIS.

It's just it doesn't tell you where, there's not always tell you where that information came from. Well, one of the ways I always put it put, put it is we need to know what we're talking about. Yeah. Because we have loads and loads of data in biology and the person who produced it often knows what it's about.

But without the metadata that really describes what it's about, which we have no clue.

This lovely story, I think. We have this nice representation in biology for DNA and protein sequences or gesturings of letters. And biologists and biome petitions become. You know, world-class whizzes as string similarity. Searches. Comparing sequences of proteins or DNA? Yeah, so we could compare, you know, nf2 sequences are sufficiently similar.

We use quite often infer That are somehow Evolution related and doing the same thing. But what we didn't didn't have a good handle on is we know that these two Sequences are similar. But we don't know if what they do is similar because different model organism Community, so Mouse and fly, and human in different organisms.

But each domain had its own vocabulary. So how do you compare what you know about them? And this is where you get into controlled vocabularies and ontologies are a good way of delivering, controlled vocabulary. Yes, Neurontology. Well formed in computationally. Useful is a real Boon and that's where things like owl come in.

And and so it just all carries on from that and I think, you know, the generative llms you if you're careful, you can just do amazing things with But, and you can do. Reasonably, good. So the general rule is if these words are used in the same way, then they mean the same thing.

So it works quite a lot of the time. Box, it's it's dangerous. But then you have to go with the overheads of building these. But there's a hell of work going on. Now about how you can combine all diesel knowledge bases with. So, um, With the sort of machine learning.

Yeah natural language processing. Yeah llm probabilistic stuff. Logical stuff. Yeah it's what they call it uh yeah this incorporating the symbolic reasoning. Yeah yeah and combining it with a machine learning. Yeah more and more powerful stuff. The Whistle Stop tour of your career. Um, We talked about well, so we were any particular obstacles that you faced on that Journey.

The. Were interesting or that and how did you overcome them? Well, I find this really interesting. Um, They're obviously not being able to see presents is difficulties. But, Well, I I suppose one of my strategies over time was Um, I voided the bits of bioinformatics that involve pretty pictures and if the accessibility was against magical and did something else instead, actually, things like ontology's work, Very well in in this respect.

But the visualisation isn't necessarily the it's not there for the, it's not that machines, it's there for the humans, I suppose. Well one of the things I I think I believe I've learnt. Over the years is that most diagrams. Scientific obstacles. So just have to make them look pretty.

I mean they are an alternative way of presenting the information. I'm most used to non-sighted readers well because there's a question. Are they useful? Decided people. And yes, sure, they, they are often or should be an alternative way of presenting the information summarising. Perhaps enabling you to show relationships, which are somewhat implicit in text, but over the years, I mean, I guess I sort of construct, the diagram in my head.

Yeah. And, I mean, and, and having, I mean, one thing I remember. So, uh, when you, when I first meeting, when, uh, PhD supervision meeting, I sent you an email with a list of things I wanted to discuss. And the thing that surprised me, was you memorised? Well, because you couldn't write that down, you couldn't rely on the visual cue and you didn't want to be using the screen reader.

Presumably in the meeting. So though I think nine points on the on the agenda and you just memorised them all. Now a sat there thinking

A day ago whenever it was and memorised it all I reached so it seemed remarkable but so you have to do all the time. So there's uh they're slightly snarky response to that is Points might well have been obvious and I could just work them out anyway, but the thing is human memory is great.

Apart from that is really flaking. And most people use paper because the paper remembers. Or screens or screens. And so you'd write things down on the paper you don't have to bother but human memories is good. You know how how for how long have human beings done writing over the last few thousand years?

Yeah. So we relied on memory from most of our existence, it's a species Because I had to rely on it more. I just use it more and most people could do it if they wanted to, but they don't need to. So why why spend the effort? You know? I I have this policy of strategic laziness Which is, I think every computer scientist show, if you can all, if you can automate it, why do it yourself?

And I think being strategically lazy is, uh, key to so much. So many advances strategy, I think. And I think one, one of the things, one of the things I love about universities is they're liberal estate liberal with a small L. You know, there's tip, you know, Autobiography, which I was rereading.

So he's saying that uh, being liberal in the sense that accepting of your disability. Yes, in a way that Wouldn't be the case elsewhere. Yes. And I think universities have flawed meritocracies If you, if you're if you're good you'll probably usually win out now. And I I emphasise the imperfect meritocracy and, you know, liberal.

But you know, that doesn't mean The fact that I've been successful, means it all disabled people. Yeah, you can, you know, blah, blah, put all these obvious caveats on it. And certainly one so many people. Feel it's okay to top me. Stop me in the street and tell me things.

Like I don't think I can cope. I lost my size which On British, which I saw, I find that quite a surprising thing to do, but my certainly my, my inner silent response is Well, you've got two options and you either cope, or you don't cope. Yeah. And one of those isn't an option.

You know, not the way I was brought up. Somebody's stoic attitude too. Look at you, though. I'm not knocking it obviously like you say, you don't have any choice, you just got to get on with it. Well, yes, man. The dangerous exercise complacent and arrogant and I I know my experience is only my home.

Yeah. And uh, yeah, I'm not saying that all blind people could are all disabled people could have done what I've, you know, circumstances during all these obvious caveats but You know. And to be supportive. I mean I guess people like your wife have been a key to helping you as well as colleagues and so computer science at Manchester, Is full of great people.

Yeah. And Yeah. I'm a bit collaborator. I've got lots of other people to work. Do the bits? I can't do. Yeah. And I try and give as much as I take. I might not always be successful, but the office is full of great people. Both support staff and and other academics.

And Man, I don't know because I can't see them. They might be panicking all the time, but, you know, I just turn up and I do stuff and everyone's very accepting and they argue with me, if they think I'm wrong, we just sort of decide what we're going to do and do it.

So, I mean, being so being, uh, being a member of a minority group and in being visually impaired is, is sometimes a challenge for people. I say, you talked about how, how you can get around that, but what could employers and universities do to make uh, workplaces like this one more accessible to visually impaired people?

I mean the other thing I would add is I'm also I'm white and male. Yes. Wait sure. Master mediate, these things. Yeah yeah, a bit.

Appoint people like you and it's a sort of fundamental attitude that we You know, as you well know we've always struggled in computer science to get women. Interested.

Could employers and young universities do to make workplaces like this one more accessible to visually impaired people. I think the other thing that I would add is I, I'm also I'm white and male. Yes, wait sure must ameliorate these things, yeah, yeah. Uh a bit. I think. It's the usual story about diversity.

That you don't only appoint people like you and it's a sort of fundamental attitude that Um, You know, as you well know we've always struggled in computer science to get women. Interested in it and into computer science. Yeah. Undergraduate. Upwards and the problems are further back. I think in British Society.

Yeah, computers are for boys. Yeah, which is a particularly sort of North American UK thing, which is very different elsewhere in the world. Um, And there's all that talent out there, you know, from all the people who are, you know, white men. Yeah. Yeah. The, the discipline is missing out on, but we're just missing out on.

I I don't think we sit here saying computers are only for boys. But it's a, a big approachment. It's much deeper than we can do, but it's sort of deeply frustrating and I think that's just general true for people, you know, all sorts of minorities disability or otherwise accepting that people have, you know, the human beings and they've got brains.

Yeah, and I think the university is Is well intentioned but it does have a habit of buying software which is sub-optimal in its accessibility. Yeah yeah and there's you know, things like the web W3c's web accessibility initiative, which gives you basic basic. Um, accessibility I very much believe that if you design, Elegant accessible user interfaces that they tend to us to be good for everybody.

Yeah, yeah. Not just the people that and fancy pants trying too hard fancy user interface and you just messy and cluttery and hard work. Yeah. I I offer you Blackboard. As I think one of the most inaccessible lumps of software I've ever come across in my life, I was saying goodbye to it and and Coming more Senior Management and University and stepping aside from teaching men that I've basically almost never had to use Blackboard, which I'm truly thankful.

It's as much as I can attribute to evilness to a piece of software. It's evil. So, in terms of, I mean, you mentioned senior Management there. So in terms of the next question is, um, you're the next vice Chancellor. So this is a hypothetical question because I really don't want to be the next voice answer.

But let's say you are, what would you do to make to improve? You know, uh, Does so attribution. Academics, love moaning and and I will move along with the best academic, but I still think the academic life is Wonderful. Yeah. What job can I get paid to largely do what the hell I want.

Nevertheless, we're in certain constraints within certain constraints. A lot of people paying me to do it and not being illegal and things like that and not too grossly. Unethical. But I think, um, Partly. I think covid the pandemic has Amplified it but I think the university has slipped into Control freak mode, and this can be very controlling and I think The university that Great Central.

Uh, entity in the hollowed-out volcano where the university run runs its operations, it needs to trust us. The the University of the university is full of Wonderfully able people trust, trust them to do it, and then management or leadership. Jobs are to kick people's backsides when they get it wrong rather than just trying to control everything.

Yeah, yeah. And I think that if there's one thing I I'd like to see in the University is trust its staff. What might flow from that is staff trusts seeing a management a bit more. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Good. All right. Um we've not got one actually we've got 15 minutes left so um to to wrap things up or start wrapping things up there.

The next bit is one tune one podcast, one book one film. So um Start with one tune. Would you recommend our rediscovery? Yes. No. That I'm going to choose the Beatles. So I even though I was only born in 1965 and barely, remember the Beatles BB a thing, a current thing.

I, I have a long-standing Love of The Beatles. My current, my current favourite Beatles. June is I want you. She's so heavy which is a John Lennon track, right? From side. One of Abbey Road which I just think is marvellous. Does it have? Is there any particular reason that's important to you?

Is it take you to a time and a place? Or is it just a? I think it was. There was a well, it's just some music, but time and place would be the summer of 1981. Just after I've finished my over levels, right? Okay. Because go to sixth one college was a completely different experience, right?

Just separate your own. Also, please tell us a bit like an intermediary University, effectively, you're not. You're very much so. Okay. Um, so that's one tune one. I know one podcast so I know you're you're a bit of a radio for junkie. Yes. So you're gonna have might have a bit of difficulty in choosing one.

There's lots of there's lots of favour, but so if I had to choose one, Would make more or less on Radio 4 compulsory listening for the whole population because they, it looks at numbers. Yeah, in the news and pulls them apart usually. So Tim Harvard, Tim Harford who's an economist and it's done in collaboration with the open University.

And typically, you know, people say there was this number in the news and I'm suspicious of it. Can you have a look at it? Yeah. Can they just put it apart is with the whole team of people? I mean, it's obviously not just him. It's this whole production team of staff that and statisticians and researchers that go and investigate the story behind the data.

Yes it is. Fascinating So, Uh obviously Radio 4. I have got my uh Desert Island disc lists of tunes and book and luxury. So my book is the uh Fallen rise of retinal bearing, right? Oh what's his name? David knobs. So the book which got made into the 1970s television series issues much darker than the TV series.

And it was I was a book is darker than the TV series. Yes. And it's It's just, um, and I read it. I saw the television series and read it when I was 11 or 12. And it was this man trapped in a tedious, middle management job and he just wants to caucus Snoop, but Typical.

Typical jobs and careers and life. So he just threw it all up, right? And uh, Went on the road. Right? And then came back as a different person and marriage his wife, right? And, you know, he's massively anti-establishment and just cocking a smooth with everything I just thought it was wonderful and uh, as resulted in me, not being able to take anything very seriously.

Excellent. Apart from apart, from my wife, tea and cheese. All of which I take very seriously, they can do that. Well, yes, definitely. Um, that's good. So I haven't seen, I have not seen the series or read the read the books myself to go and investigate. But I heard of it obviously but never never got any deeper than that.

Um, so that's the book. And the last one is one film favourite film Brazil. Uh, it's a film. I've actually seen Fine, what's it about Terry Gilliam? Right? And with Michael Palin in it, does this post python or pre-python post, post python, it was It was in the 80s or even yeah, early 80s, I think Brazil was And it's in this massively, authoritarian society.

And is about sort of subversion, you might be seeing as film the theme coming out here, subverb subversing controlling authorities, right? And had Robert De Niro as a gorilla. Central heating engineer what sort of what sort of area are we talking about of 17, early 80s? I think, right?

Early 80s, I think Or. Okay good. So that's um, Add one, two in one book, one podcast Hotel. We've got uh, the last few things is time traveller. So I ask all the guests on a show. Step into our colleague, in the physics department, has been to the time machine has led to us.

You can, you can step in that time. You can go back to meet yourself either as perhaps starting a degree or and or starting a PhD, what would you tell your former self? Um, Enjoy yourself. It's going to be really great, right? I think. And paint is like in a luxury career, a PhD is a luxury thing to do.

And, Let's just be the law, really. I suppose it's easy to get diverted by Distractions or anxieties or pressures to perform, or whatever it might be, and you're saying it, you know, it's important to not lose side effect to enjoy what you're doing? Yes, I think it really is, enjoy what you're doing and I think, uh, I don't regret which degree I I did, but I think if choosing a degree purely on weight eating is going to get you a job.

Uh, that's obviously important but you've also got to choose something you're interested in, make sure you're interested in it and enjoy it. I think the the doing it for a career is we'll get you a certain distance I suppose, but it doesn't. I mean, I assume cases where that's broken down where there's lots of parental pressure to see a certain subject and then you know whatever subject not just computer science but I think having him struggle because they're not.

Yeah, I think having a bit of a pass for your subject area. Yeah, it really does help. Right. I've always, uh, I've always tried to imagine how you have a passion about accountancy. But obviously people do and where when when we're not all the same, yeah. Uh luckily Anything else apart from enjoying yourself?

I mean you were mentioning enjoy yourself a little bit too much. Yeah, things not to do. I, I think I might have enjoyed myself too much in my undergraduate degree. I got what used to be referred to as a drinking man's first. Otherwise known as a 2-1. And I I know, I did drink a little too much at Universe and it says the joint is two sizes, is enjoying the academic stuff, right?

But then there's also enjoying all the social stuff that comes alongside. It being part of a community of people. Yeah, Scholars and students and you learn so much more than just your degree subject and, yeah, and back back in those days. Those eight percent of 18 year old 20 universities.

So it's a bit of a lock train as a very protected idyllic environment. Yes. Not like, yeah, we got 950 percent of eight from Euros going to University. Yeah. And it's a very different thing, but I still think there's obviously all those opportunities. They call it protected environments, just explore so many people.

Yeah, there's no, I came from a small small provincial town on the south coast of England. Then went to a you know, a big city. I met all these different sorts of people from different places. Yeah. Yeah. Obviously they're all white and middle classes, most times. But, but even with that within that, you know, no to those of different people.

I've had people who didn't come from the UK, right? Which I think most dates are quite astonishing. Excellent. So um, that's the time traveller piece. Then there's some I mean we've talked, I think we've covered I think this is going to talk more about is your PhD and biomatics we've covered that in the first bit.

So I'll move on to Um, one of the other things significant things you did in, your career was service head of Department. Yes. Third, longest serving department. Um and you had some unique challenges in that. So, you were head of Department during It's always a challenging post, but you Had brexit, you had Kobe, the other pandemic you had.

Um Restructuring faculty. And you also had a sort of a big spike in student numbers caused by some of those circumstances. So, Um, can you talk about? The challenges of facing that. And what your experience was, how you how you cope with it. Well, I think, uh, It's horribly cliched but you go back to the, you know, keep calm and Carry On.

Yeah. And I think to do these kind of jobs, you've got to be resilient But you're not you're not alone in these things and I had a fantastic bunch of people around me both the PS and academic staff and the whole department. Um, you know, really, I think really pulled together and I can remember when, when we had the first big spike in numbers and Sean, and I called a staff meeting saying, look, we've almost got twice as many students as we're planning for Shown and I were really kacking it.

Yeah, we thought we'd be lynched, but everyone just says the big sort of thing that I got from the room is, right? We're in this situation. What do we know? What do we need to do to? You know, make sure it works for the students and for ours and I shouldn't have been surprised really?

Because that's what this department is. Like. Yeah, yeah. Gonna be quite grumpy sometimes. But you know, everyone, you know, more or less wants to do wants to do their best and do a good job. And you know, that just makes all those big disruptive things that came along during my time.

Header departments. Just meant that, you know, Computer science, which I think is and it's not just down to me. I think it's been true for a long time. I think is respected for just being a really well functioning. Yeah. Um, It might be awkward. So the management outside the uh department, but I think some of that awkwardness, I mean, you you've been experienced this firsthand.

So observing heads of department and Steve Furby, who's been another guest on this show, said that one of the things that's challenging about being a header department, is that the power goes up and the responsibility goes down. So you have a lot of responsibility as a head of Department, but the sort of the power that you have, for example, in deciding, how money is spent, is slightly curtailed, shall we?

Say going back to a point about the University being quite controlled there? How delicately put Duncan, um, But so, I mean, I I how you know that must have been, I quite frustrating. I imagine and but you just got on with it. I mean, how how do you, how did you manage that?

Personally? Um, Even with it, within all the constraints, you can still find ways of, of doing things. And this isn't, you know, doing wizard wheezes or cheating. You can, you can look for areas of flexibility, right? Computer scientists always read the specification. We can see the gaps in it.

Did you have an example specifically of something like where something where you managed to find some flexibility that you were able to? Used. So for the benefit of, I can remember at a faculty leadership. Team meeting there was a certain amount of pressure being applied for heads of school which I wasn't.

The time I had the department to chair all the examination boards and since uh, marketing has become Anonymous and the progression rules and uh, classification rules have progressed. It's almost algorithmic. And there's this sort of Thing that, you know, had to be a, you know, Overseen by someone responsible.

Yeah. And my view was that either typically they were immensely tedious and we're still in the mode that all academics should have turned up. But I read the policy and said it's recommended. But it's chaired by their school and recommended means you don't have to do it. Yes. So I didn't and I thought having someone much more competent, like, Sean Beckoff, uh, or the other yeah headset.

Yeah, heads of function. Yeah. The the director of undergraduate studies or director of PGT, doing here with a much smaller bunch of people who weren't wasting their time. Yeah sitting around voting on things where they didn't understand. Okay. Um, and so you can look, it's not and it's not it's not gaming it's

In your interpretation of the policy. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Which are typically so badly written. Good. Okay, so um you've got you've got another appointment to Dash to it let's welcome to you. So I'm going to say um Thank you for coming on the show. Thank you for telling us a little bit more about your story.

Um, we'll be sorry to see you leave obviously. So I know we're having a celebration next week uh but I'll be hanging around you'll be hanging around as uh Emeritus telling everybody. It was actually my day. Time a pleasure. Duncan, thanks.


# Just a minute

Your attention. Thank you. Um, as I said earlier, we're not ourselves very seriously today and we're marking this occasion where the panel game has called, just a minute. So, our speakers will be talking for 60 seconds, on a subject of my choosing Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to just a minute.

Thank you. Thank you. Okay. And is the minute Wars, Fades. That was seamless when I practised it. Sue, just a minute.

As the minute Waltz Fades away. Once more, it's my huge pleasure to welcome our many listeners. Not only in this country, but from around the world, And welcome to the program. This week, our 12 ish Talented. An articulate players of the game, who will introduce shortly. Please welcome all 12 of them.

As usual on this show, I'm going to ask them to speak. If they can on a subject I will choose. Now in the London version of this game. They have to do this without hesitation repetition or deviation. And the Manchester version of this game, they're all going to be talking about the same subject for 60 seconds and that subject is Robert Stevens.

They can't challenge each other about their hesitation deviation repetition, which they would do on the London verse of the show. However, there can challenge them Robert. Yes. Well, well guessed, um, If you challenge them, I will stop the clock and you can explain your challenge if it's not consistent with the Robert Stevens ontology.

Choose your challenges wisely. Uh, we're not keeping the score, but if you've got any scores to settle with any of these people, This is your chance. 

# Andrew Stewart 

So we're going to start the game. With, um, Andrew Stewart. So for those of you don't know, Andrew Stewart is a current header department and it was his job to take over when Robert's reign of terror.

As he likes to call it finished the reign of terror. For those who don't know, Robert his his leadership style is Machiavellian. He He believes that it's better to be feared than loved. And it's been really Andrew's job, uh, to map up all the broken pieces after Robert's gone.

So, You can't change the chair. Anyway now so uh Andrew um, And get my stopwatch ready? Your subject is Robert Stevens. Wait a second, okay. It takes me a few seconds to get up and there will be noises okay oh sorry. Okay, time your time starts. Now, okay. Robert When I was signing your Robert, when I was signing your card, I knew, just just my personal heartfelt, the messages were that had been written by others.

This suggests one of two things to me either you have become and achieved a mother Teresa level of respect amongst all your friends and colleagues. You know so much gossip and dirt. I've heard so many people that were all absolutely desperate to stay in your good books. As the second is true, then the amount of hyperbole and different shanty.

By each of your colleagues lightly corresponds to the amount of Gossip that you have on each of them. So now Lou Robert you're clearly one of the greatest human beings that has ever walked on this Earth and I will forever remain your most humble servant.



Um, I should explain the rules of the game for people who don't listen to radio for. I understand, you know, we're an inclusive and diverse uh department and we don't want to discriminate people against people who don't listen to Radio 4. The way this game. Apparently, there are people who don't listen to Radio 4 panel games, uh, some of them are in this room.

So we have to explain the rules of the game, a little bit. Um, you do get your 60 seconds as I said and I will blow the whistle when the 60 seconds are up. So our next Not only price. Now money price was the executive assistant to Robert during his reign of terror.

That the terror was really twofold because Not only was there. The terror of the Machiavellian leadership. There was there was brexit uh there was covid there was extensive faculty restructuring. Um, and well that was all against the background of trump version one just to add a nice little touch there.

So uh, Melanie price is actually the reason that we're all still here because if she wasn't the good ship Kilburn would have sunk a long time ago with Captain Stevens and all the rest of us, on board the ship. So Melanie, Your subject is Robert Stevens? I need to start my timer, but yeah, your time starts well.

# Melanie 

Okay. I started working as Robert's PA during the covid era. There were strange times indeed for all of us. I knew Robert from our time working for lovely Carol, but not too. Well, our working relationship was all by Zoom and email for the first year or so, however, we bonded like cheese and wine and needless to say I'm extremely fond of him, some observations about Robert.

He never gets angry. He has a wicked sense of humour and is extremely patient which are all the best ingredients of a great leader. To pushed cheese and pickled baguette from Pratt. None of a decent Brew is coming on my last PDR at camps. I was Melly's Ace and everything is cool.

I mean, she's probably my favourite P&DR feedback ever Rightly he seems to deny somebody's over and wears his shorts until his knees are too cold to carry on one year. We nearly made it to October. Rabbit. You're a legend and a fantastic human. It was a pleasure working for you and I wish you a very happy cheese filled retirement.

# Sarah Mulholland

I'm gonna sit down because I'm getting too old to stand up for long periods of time. And our next uh, panelist is uh, Sarah Mulholland who Served as head of school operations, and Robert referred to people in you were based in the engineering building weren't you along with our next, guest Alice.

As a very famous uh expression that wasn't used widely elsewhere in the faculty, it was the hollowed out volcano. So that was it, okay. All right. So we're very honoured to have two people from the hollowed out volcano here today. And challenged already. Sarah Mulholland your Subject is Robert Stevens.

Your time starts now. Thank you. I'm working with Robert was never ever done, ever. I don't think any of the academic has made me laugh. So much so many inappropriate times as Robert has done. I've also never seen anyone speak. Truth to power the way Robert did so successfully and most of the time they never really knew what happened to them.

Robert. We're always a blast but not for Robert. Um, we always did lots of social Styles, you know, psychometric tests and Robert was always a completely either end of the line to everybody else in the room, but Robert always made it clear that his idea of an away day was sitting in a pool and we get a lot more done than doing ridiculous.

You know, tools and painful tasks. I remember our covert days quite fondly, with Robert, we did many a quiz, didn't we rob it online? And one of the times we did this session around things you didn't know about people and I've never seen Robert's face crease with laughter so much when someone was talking about carving animals out of raw potatoes and making up pet songs, which included things like he's a big boy and Nelly Nelly.

Um, and highly emotionally intelligent. Robert, always always knew whenever when something was wrong and always reached out, um, he was an incredibly supportive colleague and we had many, many a delicious meal and many many a drink after work, which was the perfect antidote to some very, very stressful days.

But no more of those stressful days for you. Robert. Thank you.

# Alice Larkin 

Our next speaker is um Alice Larkin who is Professor of climate science and climate policy, energy policy that was it, energy policy, uh you're probably thinking what does that got to do with Robert? Well, Alice was actually serving as head of the newly formed School of Engineering, uh, which meant that she was actually Robert's line manager during those, uh, Um, Alice your subject is Robert Stevens your time starts now.

Thank you very much. Um when I met Robert, he was already doing, I had a school job and I wasn't I had a lot to learn and so looked to him for help. Here are a few things that he taught me use logic to understand policy. This will give you new degrees of freedom that few others, particularly those who design, the policy will have ever thought about.

There is such a thing as a hollowed out volcano, it is real and somewhat active, although its seismic warning signs, should generally be ignored. Formal expressions of agreement should be along the lines of groovy Coolio and Fab cheese can be a useful driving tool depending on who the head of Department.

Might be avoid eating and drinking while sitting next to your head's. A department in any formal or even informal meeting in case one of them and I'm thinking of one in particular Whispers something that might make you burst out laughing inappropriately And that very few people despite their fancy titles are allowed pointy scissors.

Finally, and sincerely every stressful meeting every bad day, every apparent emergency can be overcome through humour. And for me, There's no one who can do that better than Robert.

Perhaps, I I think we had to take a second here and be very impressed that these speeches are all exactly within 60 seconds. But I I think we're moving on to the stage in the game where there might be some challenges. Um don't forget, you do have challenges, you can stop and uh stop the speakers.

But our next three speakers are here because Uh, they've been colleagues of Roberts for a long time and they were actually the three people sat right next to me. Now who served on the interview panel, 29 years ago in this building to employ Robert as a postdoc handsome young man called Robert Stevens arrived fresh from his PhD in York and met these three young people.

Well, they were young men anyway uh, for a job interview. So we're going to start with our first. Uh, honest is Uh, Professor Norman Payton. Norman your subject is Robert Stevens your time starts now So, uh, so because we were invited to speak on the kind of being on a Robert's interview panel.

I thought this was an opportunity to say something about that interview.

Actually, unfortunately, I cannot remember the interview. So however, I did collect Robert from the precinct centre ahead of the interview and I do remember that he was waiting a distinctive hat. Hi. So wait. So the model of the tail here, here, maybe that it doesn't matter what you say an interview as long as you've gone, distinctive headgear.

So my observation from working with Robert, is that his memory works quite differently from mine? I need everything written down. Where does Robert tends? Just to remember things? So Robert. And I have had one-to-one interviews in which I've written things on the Whiteboard, which is obviously inaccessible to Robert entirely, from my own benefit and by the end of the meeting, he will still just remember everything that was said.

So for most of you, if you reflect back on this meeting in future, I predict that you will remember my hat and nothing that I've said.

So I get our next panelist is uh Carol needs no introduction. Really you are also serving on the interview panel as well. So Cal Professor Carroll. You are your subject is Robert Stevens your time starts now. Thank you. Bow hat. What larks? Boss. Post doctor boss to tyrannical challenge.

Anyway, it was bizarre. Got my time back. So post doctor tyrannical boss in 21 years how we laughed at that, it's the jollies schmoozing dinners, that pop into my mind, the Singapore Raffles. Tiffin that was offset by being put up in the YMCA by the British Council the staff.

So insistent that I was his wife that I should share his room. Mrs. Stevens, when he was doing his made to measure suit fitting. Boozy dinners are branding the overthrow of our enemies. Many ontologists subversive groovy ideas sketched, on napkins. That people were surprisingly took seriously the modules and capulets the seven, deadly sins of bioinformatics many projects, including my grid.

Some of the people here are still in recovery from that. I'm proud that over half of my top 20 papers, Google Scholar are with Robert, uh, of nearly 8, 000 citations, and Robert. What do points mean? It's all been rather Splendid.

Thank you, Carol. Uh, the next guest is, uh, Andover and Professor, Andrew brass. Andy was again, the third person on that, uh, interview panel, Andy your time, your time, your subject is Robert Stevens, your time Source. Now, Journey has been from a postdoc to a head of school and I think we helped two lessons to learn from that one is just be nice to people because you have no idea at what point they're becoming your new tarential boss.

And so him becoming head of school isn't the complete reason that I actually led to a completely different faculty? Then to reflect upon sort of the rather Brave and foolhardy experiment of asking or allowing a smart ontologist and logician, that was in the cervic wit and a CBA mindset.

And think about CBL, that's really important to take on such a critical leadership role. And I think all of us have, what does CBA mean can't be asked I wouldn't reduce it to it then. So I think all of us have got memories of some of classic emails we've had from Robert and I think my favourite iPad is one where I think it was something from faculty about how we were all going to have to do more with less.

And I think the email was something along the lines of That is all. And the amount of semantic content. In those six words was amazing, so whether it's guiding CSO? Well, through such a massively difficult time, or in nudging and corralling. Um, Deans. I think just a really wonderful example of just what generally authentic and slightly left field.

Leadership can look like

Thank you, Andy. Uh, next speaker is Sean beckoffer, Sean. You were joined a postdoc. A similar time to Robert. I guess. I think he was roughly in the night in the 90s. Uh, so, uh, Robert Stevens, your time starts now. All right. So I've worked a little bit in various roles since he came to Manchester uh research project is Ras.

We've shared teaching and more. Recently, we attempted to herd this ship of unruly cats through some rather choppy Waters. But and in that time, I've learnt lots of things about anthology development and perhaps more than I'd ever want to know about cheese, potato varieties British history and some of the more obscure corners of the Radio 4 schedules.

But there's always been a real sense of fun and enjoyment working with Robert, even in the kind of really, really dark times. Um, he's one of the calmest most unflappable people I've ever worked with and he has a refreshingly small eagle, which is not something that one can always say about senior academics.

So, Duncan said, I said nothing too sentimental, but I'm gonna quote a people's lyric because I know Roberts loved from The Beatles and it's and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love, you make. And I think the number of people gathered today is Testament to the love that Robert has made in his time here.

And I, then realised talking about Robert love making is probably not really. To finish up. Finish up Robert. Kbo.

Uh, our next speaker is Helen Parkinson, who is the European biophomatics Institute in Cambridge and is literally just got off the train out of the taxi. Congratulations on making it here. Your connection with Robert is ontological. Uh and continues to be, I think so. I'm going to say uh Helen Parkinson your your subject is Robert Stevens your time starts.

Now I'm sort of wishing I prepared a bit better at this point. People have got notes. Um Robert it is lovely to see you. I met Robert in 2001 because valwood was sick on Brasso and Robert was on the other side and went what's just happened? And I was like, yeah, it's bad.

And Robert hasn't been my head of school. Robert's been my friend, been my collaborator and actually the voice of reason and has been kind and generous and tactfully pointed out when I've been wrong about many, many things, When he was made head of school, he very kindly sent me the pack because I'd also been made of head of something that had cluster in the name and cluster was in the name for a reason because it was all a bit painful and Robert talked to me through all that, including querying the word cluster.

Kindly sent me all these materials from the head of school training. He said, you might want to read this, you might find it helpful. He was there when we in our worst times, he was there in our best times. He was there for some truly outstanding travel experiences. Getting to Bar Harbour Maine.

Together was a bit of an adventure. We taught in Portugal together. Several times where the hotel was terrible. The orange juice was terrible but the food was really really good. If you remember, Robert, and the students were super smart. I've enjoyed his voice of reason. Um, I'm an ontologist among other things.

Ontologists say horribly picky. And terribly pedantic, but Robert was always the calmest and most sensible person in any of those rooms including where Michael ashburner was standing on a chair shouting which Uh, which you some of you may remember. Um, so 10 seconds. I thought I'd gone over. I often do so Robert.

Here's a delight to be here and see you. I have missed seeing you in person. That's been a really long time and not just has changed quite a lot. Had to get Cab from the station. Also Duncan said, I had to So much Robert for being my friend and my collaborator and the voice of reason.

And for being you because all of the emails are delighted and I have to say the references to people that say The head of school, this person's fantastic. You should just hire them boys. Always always resulted in a hire and a fantastic person. Thank you. Thank you, Helen.

Next speaker is jealous and yeah. Liz like me is a one of the PHD. Would you have any other PhD students? Yes. Excellent. Oh, yes. Good. There they are. Yes, they are. There's one PhD student who I, uh, Paul Fischer who it can't make it today. So, he sends his apologies, he will write you an email.

It was, uh, to do with a uh, the train falling over in finsbury Park or something sounded. Very Ah, yes. Uh, we'll figure it out. Um, so yellies. Your subject is Robert Stevens, your time Starts Now. Okay, thank you. I think I'm representing PhD students overwards. So I want to start to say, thank you, Robert on behalf of all your PhD students.

I met Robert in 2000 which I counted 25 years ago. Long time ago, I was looking for a master thesis. I talked to Carol, she said you should speak to Robert about tables so thank you. I got interested in reading tables in audio. I don't know how he did it but he got me into it and I'm still doing research related to that.

Then Robert became my PhD supervisor. We had as you know with PhD students you have many meetings long meetings and he used to say oh very interesting very interesting and he made me feel very good. Thank you very much. I know I was so boring. I think you made us really feel good.

So, thank you. And then when I finished my PhD, I got married and he came to my big fat superior wedding in Cyprus. Uh, he was a country shock to him, I think. And Carol was there he was a big culture shock to them, but it was really good to have them there.

Thank you very much. Thank you Robert. I just want to say thank you all behalf of your PhD students. Thank you.

Uh our next speaker is Phil Lord from Newcastle University. You were a postdoc employee working with Robert. Uh, you wrote some of those payco wrote. Some of those papers that have been very highly cited in including one on the semantic similarity. So Phil Ward, your subject is Robert Stevens, your time starts now.

Uh it's difficult going near the end uh because some people have stolen some of my my buzzwords already. Sean back off where I'm looking at you. Uh, so early in my timer, Manchester me and Robert were due to give a practical workshop on the other side of the world.

And the day before we were due to fly out, everything broke, it wasn't actually my fault. It was somebody else's, but it all went wrong. And I was starting to panic and Robert just took me to one side and said, calm down, it'll all be fine. And it was and it's something this I've tried to copy this unflappability that he has ever since.

And it's one great thing that I've learnt from Robert. I've learnt many, many other things from Robert as well but I'm not going to tell you about these because they were all rude and tasteless.

Um, last but not least. Uh, Simon who is another professor in this department. Uh, Again, with Robert from the early days, back in well, 2000. I think it was. Was it even earlier? Like, pretty much when you got here doing work on accessibility I'm still doing that kind of stuff now.

So, um, Sign in your subject, you are last guest. So Simon, you are subject. Your subject is Robert Stevens, your time starts now. Well, I'm bloody annoyed because I did what I was supposed to do which was have some really embarrassings and taste of stories from Robert, which I've written down in this book.

And now, I'm told, I'm not supposed to have this Boris embarrassing tasteless toy. I'm supposed to be supposed to be a living. The points of these embarrassing and taste of stories was that, um, from the first time I met Robert, I knew he was if you like one of us that he was one of, you know, he was one of the academics.

He was one of us. I felt really Strongly in my PhD supervision with him. And with Carol overt, I was looked after and that, um, he wouldn't let me go wrong. Even down to deciphering carols, many, many screeds of red, Corrections all over my all over my work. From telling me what I should be doing when it comes to gardening.

When telling me what I should be doing when it comes to abstracts. I remember times when we all went down to, uh, to kind of write our first paper, which was really Robert and Kell's first paper. And I just pretended, uh, Um, up to the department and really after he's retired, he's still going to be one of us as far as I know, whatever that means, you're still one of us.

Robert and you can't get away from it.

So uh thank you. Thank you all our speakers. It really only remains for me to say um thanks to uh, delightful and very clever players of this game. You're kept exactly within your time and I never ignored when a stopwatch went over a minute. Um, we thank in Mesata who created this game.

If you want to go and see what this is all about, you're started thinking, what the hell is this? All about just search for uh just a minute wherever you get your podcast or you can listen on BBC, sounds Thank you very much uh tune in the next time we play...

Just a minute!


# Thought for the day


They're most of that time has been at the University of Manchester in the department of computer science, which is Ace Fab and groovy Uh, and it really has been fun and, and boring old farts like me. Always moan about how Dreadful everything has become, and it's all much better in my day.

Uh, but I still think the academic life is just such a cool job. Who else will pay you for doing more or less what you want? And you know, To hollowed out volcano might be chipping away at it, but it's still a great job. And Manchester computer science has been a really nice place to do it and it's I've always remember is Liz Kane here.

Yes. Liz, Kane told me a great, a great story about Dean Martin at uh, graduation said to said to Liz, what's it like working? Such a grumpy Department and Liz just looked a bit beloved and said, but it's not And uh I think we might sometimes be a little spiky to those outside the department.

But inside is actual rather nice here. I think and nice colleagues. And it really has been a groovy time. And I I never thought I'd say this, I even enjoyed being head of departments.

And, I remember. Relating to Martin Schrader. The first thing I said at a staff meeting Upon becoming head of Department or head of school as it was, and I stood up and I looked around the room, which was at least reasonably full, and I said, First thing I'd like to say is the innocent have nothing to fear and what did the audience?

Do they laughed at me? And that is when Martin accused me of being a stalinist.

And as as Alice suggests, this has largely been my style in uh in meetings. I think it is difficult to take things too seriously. And as Alice also said, I did another. Head of school did comment when I picked a part, yet another university policy. That every policy forming panel body in the university should have a computer scientist on it because we actually read the words.

And no one else seems to do that. So, but uh, anyway, I shall, uh, I've, I've had one glass of wine and I and, and I'm already rambling on, um, but it has, it has just simply been wonderful working here. With a wonderful bunch of people. And uh, I'm very, very pleased and touched about how many people have turned up here.

For this bash. And do have a lovely time. Thank you very much.

Uh, we have a small token of our appreciation, um, which is in this bag here. Um, I'm sure maybe I, should I give this to you, or should I hand it to Mary Rose? I'll give it to you. Well, it's It's a Pandora's box of all kinds of fantastic and amazing things.

So um we hope you enjoy them. Including money and cheese. Yeah. So it's just a small bag of uh well thank you big things. Thank you, Robert. Thank you.
