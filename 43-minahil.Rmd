# Minahil's Story {#minahil}

Meet Minahil Tariq, shown in figure \@ref(fig:minahil-fig). Minahil graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence in 2025. During her study, she did summer internships at the University of Manchester and [Amazon Web Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services), see figure \@ref(fig:minahil-internships-fig). She served as Chair of [unicsmcr.com](https://unicsmcr.com): the University of Manchester Computer Science society. After this episode was recorded she started working in the Virtual Engineering Centre [virtualengineeringcentre.com](https://www.virtualengineeringcentre.com/) (VEC) at the University of Liverpool.

## What's Your Story Minahil? {#minahil-story}

We talked about switching from studying law to studying computer science, and switching from studying in the USA to studying in Manchester. We chatted about the benefits of slowing down. We also discussed why _The Intern_ is one of her favourite films and _Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!_ is one of her favourite books. We also discussed her experience of being a member of under-represented and minority groups, particularly women in computing.

During her study Minahil presented at the BCS Women Lovelace Colloqium at the University of Glasgow: [bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org](https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/) see figure \@ref(fig:bcswomen-fig), [@minahilwomen] As well as her time at AWS, we talked about her work in IT services at The University of Manchester and the [Institute of Teaching & Learning](https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/umitl/) (ITL) with [John Roache](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/john-roache). [@roache]

We also discussed:

* Interning at the University of Manchester and AWS, shown in figure \@ref(fig:minahil-internships-fig).
* The importance of User Experience (UX) via [Simon Harper](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/simon.harper)
* Why Rewriting the Code [rewritingthecode.org](https://rewritingthecode.org) and [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/) premium are valuable 
* How scheduling was a key skill she learned on the job as part of [Amazon's leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles). [@amazonprinciples]
* Her honours project with [Jiaoyan Chen](https://chenjiaoyan.github.io/) on knowledge graphs [@minahilthesis] 
* Why data science and machine learning are interesting places to work
* How to balance quality and quantity of job applications 
* The importance of getting feedback from multiple sources early and often on your CV, see section \@ref(quick)

(ref:captionminahilinterns) Minahil did summer internships at the University of Manchester in IT services (left) and [Amazon Web Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services) (right). AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis.

Finally we chatted about how we can improve teaching at the University of Manchester, why she enjoyed [Angelo Cangelosi](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/angelo.cangelosi)'s robotics classes, how more coursework, fewer exams and using [Hypothes.is](https://www.hypothes.is/) could improve learning.

## One Book {#minahil-book}

For her book, Minahil chose [Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!) [@surelyjoking] She enjoyed the portrayal of Physicists as playful and sociable, see figure \@ref(fig:joking-fig).

```{r joking-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmrfeynman)"}

(ref:captionmrfeynman) The book _Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a
Curious Character_ is an edited collection of reminiscences by the Nobel Prize-winning
physicist [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman). [@surelyjoking]


## One Film {#minahil-film}

For her film, Minahil chose [The Intern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intern) [@theintern] for the calm demeanour of the senior intern played by Robert De Niro, see figure \@ref(fig:theintern-fig)
