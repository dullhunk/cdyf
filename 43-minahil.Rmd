# Minahil's Story {#minahil}

Meet Minahil Tariq, shown in figure \@ref(fig:minahil-fig). Minahil graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence in 2025. During her study, she did a summer internship at [Amazon Web Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services) and served as Chair of [unicsmcr.com](https://unicsmcr.com): the University of Manchester Computer Science society. After this episode was recorded she started a job with the Virtual Engineering Centre [virtualengineeringcentre.com](https://www.virtualengineeringcentre.com/) (VEC) at the University of Liverpool.

## What's Your Story Minahil? {#minahil-story}

We talked about switching from studying law to studying computer science and the benefits of slowing down. We also discussed why _The Intern_ is one of her favourite films and _Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!_ is one of her favourite books. We also discussed her experience of being a member of under-represented and minority groups, particularly women in computing.

During her study Minahil presented at the BCS Women Lovelace Colloqium at the University of Glasgow: [bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org](https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/) see figure \@ref(fig:bcswomen-fig), [@minahilwomen]

## One Film {#minahil-film}

For her film chose [The Intern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intern) [@theintern] for the calm demeanour of the senior intern played by Robert De Niro, see figure \@ref(fig:theintern-fig)
