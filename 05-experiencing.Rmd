# Are you experienced? {#experiencing}

So, tell me, are you experienced? Why is experience valuable and what kind of experience are employers looking for anyway? How can you get some more experience? ðŸ¤”

```{r 404-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:caption404)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/404.png")
```

(ref:caption404) Do you respond with a sheepish *experience not found* error message when people ask about your experience? Is your experience like the [classic HTTP 404](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) page not found? The client sent you a valid request for your experience, but your server couldn't find it. Awkward. Embarrassing silence? ðŸ˜³ Don't worry, there are some simple and easy ways build your experience so that instead of negative 404's, you can respond with a cheerfully positive 200 (OK), as described in this [list of HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). We'll look at some of them in this chapter.

```{r relevance-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionrelevantexp)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/What's relevant.png")
```

(ref:captionrelevantexp) You might be surprised by which of your experiences are relevant, and what kinds of experience are relevant on your CV. What's relevant sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

## What counts as experience {#counts}

When people talk about experience they often think about paid summer internships or year long placements. These are both valuable, but there are other ways to get experience which might not be immediately obvious, they include:

* Competitions: participating in competitions and hackathons will make your CV stand out
* Freelance work: being self-employed
* Insight programmes and spring weeks: work shadowing
* Part-time jobs: casual or part-time work
* Volunteering: Doing voluntary work is a good way to pick up new skills
* Being involved in societies: e.g. taking responsibility for things in a student society

## Big names {#bignames}

It's easier than you might think to get a big name on your CV. For example, many large employers run [insight days, vacation schemes and spring weeks ](https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights). These are often aimed at first years, and are sometimes less competitive to get into than a longer term commitment such as a summer internship, year-long placement or even graduate job. A big name on your CV early in your degree can help it stand out later, as fluff bucket demonstrates on their feline CV shown in \@ref(fig:bigname-fig). ðŸ˜»

```{r bigname-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbigname)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Big Name.png")
```
(ref:captionbigname) It's easier than you  might think to get a big name on your CV, sometimes these can help your application stand out from the competition.

Other ways to get a big name on your CV include joining a big name competition or event, for example:

* Google has Code Jam, HashCode and Kick Start [codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/) and Summer of Code [summerofcode.withgoogle.com](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
* Facebook has hackathons [facebook.com/hackathon](https://en-gb.facebook.com/hackathon)
* Microsoft hosts the Imagine Cup [imaginecup.microsoft.com](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/)
* There are many others like it listed at [devpost.com](https://devpost.com) and Major League Hacking [mlh.io](https://mlh.io/)

## Excuses, excuses   {#excuses}

When I tell students this, I'm often given an excuses some of which are given below.


### I missed the deadline  {#deadlines}

Stuff

### I'm busy waiting  {#busywaiting}


```{r justme-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:justme)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/is-it-just-me.png")
```
(ref:justme) The biggest waste of time is the time spent being busy waiting, and not making a start. Starting a career by getting some experience can be a daunting project, but don't allow yourself to be held captive by irrational worries about the job market. Once you start a daunting project, you will begin to see it for what it is. The ideas will come and and you won't need to fear it anymore, you may even start to enjoy the process of figuring out what your career options you are most interested in. [New Project?

###Â I don't know what I want to do  {#noclue}  

I don't know what I want to do

### I don't have any experience  

Stuff


###Â I do not have the grades  

Whatever you are studying, its easy to fall into a trap of thinking that your grades aren't good enough. While there are some employers who really care about your grades, there are plenty who don't. These employers are more interested in what you're like as a person, so any projects, experience or other activities you've done that demonstrate will help you stand out against rival candidates with better grades.




###Â I am too busy  

Stuff


###Â I keep getting rejected  

Stuff


###Â I am overwhelmed by the choices  

Stuff


###Â It is too competitive  

Stuff


### All my friends have found jobs already  

```{r grades-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionnotverygood)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/not-very-good-at-this.png")
```

(ref:captionnotverygood) Do you have the grades? Not all employers care about your academic grades because they're only a small part of what you have to offer as an employee.
