# Debug their CV {#sampling}

It's very easy to overlook mistakes in your own written communication. That's true of any covering letter, personal statement, email or message you write but it is especially likely with your CV (or resume). You can spend *hours* carefully honing the words and the formatting but not see a fatal error at the top of page one. There's two solutions to this problem, [dogfooding](#dogfooding) we've already talked about, the other is to constructively criticise other peoples writing. As well as [cv swapping](#cvswapping) you can also debug other people's CVs.

So, here are some fictitious CVs for you to debug, from students of Computer Science. They are based on CVs I've seen, warts and all. Can you spot their triumphs and tragedies? Can you debug their CV against the sample job description at CoolTech below?

Special thanks to [Toby Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Howard) and [Sean Bechhofer](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/sean.bechhofer/) for coming up with some of these names. Please direct any complaints about the terrible puns to Toby and Sean! Thanks also Ben Carter and Penny Gordon Lanes in the careers service at the University of Manchester, some of these CVs are based on examples they have collected.

## Penelope Tester {#pen-tester}

Penny Tester, or Pen as her friends call her, loves cybersecurity and reverse engineering. She has a real passion for finding vulnerabilities in software and hardware. Just don't call her a *hacker*, she hates that horribly overloaded word.

## Rick Urshion {#rick-urshion}

Rick is a big fan of functional programming and loves expressing himself using languages like Lisp, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang and Scala. He really hates side-effects but tries to avoid getting into a state about it. His critics say he can be inefficient but Rick insists he's just lazy.

## Marge Conflict {#marge-conflict}

Marge loves version control and her superpower is resolving people's differences.

## Michael Rokernel {#mike-rokernel}

Mike loves operating systems, but not if they get too bloated.

## Florence Ting-Point {#flo-ting-point}

Flo loves maths and is a particularly big fan of [floating-point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic).

## Peter Byte {#peter-byte}

Peter and his twin sister Peta, both love big data, machine learning, statistics, data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI). They come from a big family with nine siblings, Deca, Hector, Kilo, Mega, Giga, Terry, Exa, Zita and Yotta. They are wildly ambitious, but critics say the Byte family have been terribly over-hyped.

## Polina Morphism {#polly-morphism}

Polly loves object-oriented programming. She has lots of siblings, and a cousin called, Isa.

He has a younger half-brother, Neil Pointer-Exception, from his fathers second marriage. Neil Pointer-Exception prefers Java
