# Choosing your future {#choosing}
<!--old name broadening -->

Your future is full of exciting new possibilities, but which ones will you choose? What are all these intriguing possibilities for students of computing? How will you choose which one is best for *you*? When choosing your future, do you see yourself as a `default user` or the `weird edge case` pictured in figure \@ref(fig:default-user-fig)?  

```{r default-user-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiondefaultuser)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/default-user-1280x959.png")
```

(ref:captiondefaultuser) Are you a weird edge case or a default user? What are your options beyond the default graduate scheme with a big [blue-chip multinational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_chip_(stock_market)) employer? [Default user](https://bryanmmathers.com/default-user/) by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Perhaps you're a weird edge case. Perhaps typical graduate destinations such as large multi-national corporations, do not really make you want to *[Shake Your Thang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_Your_Thang)*? [@saltnpepa] Perhaps you are more interested in:

* working in computing in roles beyond software engineering?
* using your technical skills more responsibly and ethically to make the world a better place?
* starting your own business and making money for yourself, rather than other people?
* finding *hidden* or unadvertised vacancies?
* joining a startup instead of a large multinational corporation?
* venturing outside of the private sector?

Broadening your initial job search described in chapter \@ref(finding) will open up more opportunities on your horizon. This chapter will broaden those horizons and get you to think about some of the less obvious options you can choose from.

Many technology jobs exist outside of technology companies, [@outsideit] because a lot of software is written to be *used* rather than sold. Consequently, many employers create bespoke software to fit the needs of their business. The people who build it are often employees, rather than people employed by a technology company. In the United States for example, ninety percent of IT jobs are outside the traditional tech industry. Technical jobs outside the technology sector often have the advantage of being more accessible than those within a very competitive technology sector. [@burninglass]

## What you will learn {#ilo11}
1. Describe the less obvious careers that computer science can lead to, besides software engineering, including:
    + Starting a business or joining a startup
    + Working outside of the technology sector
    + Working outside of the private sector (governments, non-profits etc)
    + Roles allied to software engineering that require you to be a conversational programmer
1. Recognise the social responsibility accompanying the power held by computer scientists
1. Evaluate and compare the values of an employer with your own values and ethics
<!--negotiate multiple job offers-->


## Vocational or academic? {#vocation}
Some undergraduate degrees like medicine, dentistry and nursing are highly vocational. According to some studies, vocational degrees like these can be the best route to highly skilled jobs. [@vocational] Computer Science degrees often contain highly vocational content, with disciplines like software engineering for example. They often contain more theoretical, scientific and academic topics like the [theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation) too. 

What is the blend of vocational vs. academic in your degree? It's good to have a balance and mixture of both, as employers value both of them. However, unless you're considering a career in research or academia (see chapter \@ref(researching)) it's probably the vocational side of your degree that gives you the clearest intial direction into paid employment.

(ref:captionometer) Where does your degree fit on this `Computer Science O'Meter`? Are you pure and theoretical (red)? or highly vocational and applied (blue)?

Those who came before me, [lived through their vocations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_(New_Order_song)), from the past until completion, they'll turn away no more. [@bluemonday] Many computer scientists live through their vocation of software engineering, but software engineering isn't the only vocation available to students of Computing. Let's look at some of the other options. 

## Broadening your future beyond software engineering {#otheroles}
The phrase software engineering has been around since [Margaret Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)) (figure \@ref(fig:hamilton-fig)) led the development of software for the [Apollo Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer) in the sixties. However, the *practice* of software engineering has been around even longer right back to [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) in the nineteenth century.
<!--Ada Lovelace is often credited as being the worlds first software engineer-->


```{r hamilton-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionhamilton)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/margaret-hamilton.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionhamilton) The role of software engineer has been around for a long time but there are plenty of other roles for computer scientists to choose from. Public domain image of [Margaret Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)) in 1969 standing next to all of the printed code for the navigation software that she and her MIT team produced for the [Apollo Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer) via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3YJW](https://w.wiki/3YJW) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Software engineers (or software developers if you prefer) are one of the most popular roles for graduates (see e.g. figure \@ref(fig:nurses-fig)) but there are plenty of affiliated roles that computer scientists can choose besides software engineering, here's a quick summary of some of them:

## Research software engineering {#rse}

There are plenty of roles in computing working in research, either in computer science, or working alongside natural scientists, such as Physicists at [home.cern](https://home.cern/) or conventional scientists working at the laboratory bench. For example, there are [lots roles in research software engineering](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-01516-2) (RSE), using software engineering to facilitate better scientific research, see [society-rse.org](https://society-rse.org/).[@rses] For example, CERN employs ten times more engineers and technicians than research physicists, see figure \@ref(fig:cern-fig). For physicists to understand the data that pours off the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) (LHC), you need armies of engineers to enable the scientists to do their work. A *lot* of those engineers are working on hardware and software, and many of them won't be physicists. [@hullcern]

```{r cern-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captioncern)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cern-engineering.jpeg")
```

(ref:captioncern) Many scientific laboratories like CERN employ lots of software and hardware engineers. Computation isn't just a fundamental part of physics, it is key to all the natural sciences so wherever you find scientists, you will also find [research software engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_software_engineering). Fair use image via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/4qmF](https://w.wiki/4qmF) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Some examples of science laboratories in the UK and Europe that employ computer scientists is shown below:

* CERN, see [careers.cern/summer](https://careers.cern/summer) for summer internships and [careers.cern](https://careers.cern/) for placements and everything else
* The [Francis Crick Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick_Institute) see e.g. [crick.ac.uk/careers-study/students/sandwich-students](https://www.crick.ac.uk/careers-study/students/sandwich-students)

These are mainly UK opportunities, but it is a similar story around the world. Many Universities and research institutes have summer internships for computer science students working alongside researchers. For example, at the University of Manchester, summer vacancies tend to be advertised each year around April/May. Wherever you are, speak to the head of a research lab you're interested in. Ask them if they have plans to take on summer students.

If you're thinking of doing postgraduate study, see chapter \@ref(researching). Commercial experience gained on a summer internship or placement year is valued by *all* employers (not just commercial ones) so doing an internship or placement during your undergraduate degree is valuable wherever you end up, see section \@ref(realworld).

## With great code comes great responsibility {#peterparker}

Computer scientists wield tremendous power in the twenty first century.  We know that:

* With great power comes great responsibility [@spiderman]
* With great code comes great responsibility [@responsiblecs]

```{r spiderman-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionspiderman)"}

(ref:captionspiderman) The greater your code, the greater your superpower. [The greater your superpower, the greater your responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility).

Given the growing power of computing in the twenty-first century, computer scientists have a duty to society to use that power responsibly and justly. How can they do so? Do computer scientists need to sell their soul to the highest bidder? How can computer science be used to make the world a better place, not just making rich people richer? Lets look at these in turn

## Do you need to sell your soul? {#soul}
You will sometimes hear people saying you need to sell your soul to get a job, shown in figure \@ref(fig:diabolical-fig). See for example:

* [Soul sold for less than £12](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2051061.stm) [@bbcsoul]
* [Am I Selling My Soul to Work for My Company?](https://www.thevectorimpact.com/selling-your-soul/) [@sellmysoul]
* [google.com/search?q=selling+your+soul+to+your+employer](https://www.google.com/search?q=selling+your+soul+to+your+employer)

```

(ref:captiondevildeal) In European folklore, doing a [deal with the devil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_with_the_Devil) is a recurring theme. Wealth, power and knowledge are some of the items that might be traded for a persons soul as part of diabolical deal. Will you need to sell your soul to the devil to get the job you want?

So when you're searching for jobs and researching potential employers, one of the first things you need to find out is what the values and ethical principles of an employer are, see section \@ref(beware). This is a quick way to evaluate what makes an organisation who they are. Most employers publish their values and ethics openly, here's a small selection to give you a flavour:

* Amazon [amazon.jobs/en/principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)
* Microsoft [microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-values](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-values)
* Apple [apple.com/compliance](https://www.apple.com/compliance/)
* Google [ai.google/principles](https://ai.google/principles/)
* Morgan Stanley [morganstanley.com/about-us/morgan-stanley-core-values](https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us/morgan-stanley-core-values)

```{r morgan-stanley-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmorganstanley)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/morgan-stanley-times-square.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionmorganstanley) [Morgan Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered in New York City. The firms clients include corporations, governments, institutions and individuals. CC-BY picture of Morgan Stanley HQ in Times Square by [Ajay Suresh](https://flickr.com/photos/ajay_suresh/) on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3Vnt](https://w.wiki/3Vnt) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Let's look at Morgan Stanley (figure \@ref(fig:morgan-stanley-fig)) as an example, I've chosen these values because they are brief and self-explanatory. Morgan Stanley's values are to:

1. Do the right thing: act with integrity
1. Put clients first: listen to what the client is saying and needs
1. Lead with exceptional ideas: win by breaking new ground
1. Commit to Diversity and Inclusion: value individual and cultural differences
1. Give back: serve communities generously with expertise, time and money

Look at these values carefully, or choose the values of another employer you're interested in. What do they mean to you?

Do an employers words match their actions? The words **[Don't be evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil)** are easy to *say* but harder to *action*. Good intentions are often easier said than done.

So back to our original question, do you have to sell your soul?

* You don't have to sell your soul [@iwannabeadored]
* It depends what's in your soul anyway
* If you need help doing some soul searching, see chapter \@ref(exploring)

## Computing the future {#betterplace}
The human race faces some huge challenges in the 21st century:

* Mitigating the effects of [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change), see figure \@ref(fig:greta-fig)
* Tackling inequalities of wealth, income, race and gender [@stanley]
* Ensuring algorithms benefit *everyone* in society, not just the (predominantly) rich old white men that control the [technocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy), see figure \@ref(fig:justice-fig)
* Ensuring that technology *enables* democracy, rather than undermining it, as commentators like [Jamie Bartlett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Bartlett_(journalist)), [Carl Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Miller_(author)), [Rob Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reich), [Mehran Sahami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehran_Sahami) (any many others) have argued. [@deathofthegods; @bartlett; @systemerror]
* Providing sufficient food, water, shelter, energy, education and healthcare for a growing global population of 8 billion people and counting... [@eightbillion]
* Meeting all these goals [sustainably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability) and renewably without irreversibly depleting resources

How can computing be an ethical force for change that improves the lives people everywhere, not just those that are lucky enough to be on the wealthier side of the digital divide?

* How can computing make a difference?
* How can **YOU** use Computer Science to make the world a better place?

Here are some examples to get you started:

<!--do no harm hippocratic oath-->
* [Net Zero and greener computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_computing) 
    + see [greensoftware.foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/) and [green-algorithms.org](https://www.green-algorithms.org) [@greeneralgorithms; @Knowles2022; @netzero]
* [Smarter cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city) and more [automated homes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation) which use resources more efficiently [@smartercities]
* Fairer algorithms: see [algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias),  [responsible.ai](https://www.responsible.ai/) and figure \@ref(fig:justice-fig). The algorithmic equivalent of the hippocratic oath [do no harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere).
* More humane technology that respects users attention and minimises distraction by enabling *“Time Well Spent”*.

* Games for change, that have social impact rather than economic impact (profit) see [gamesforchange.org](https://www.gamesforchange.org/)
* Better education with computing:
     - as a subject in its own right: [Computer Science Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science_education)
     - as [educational technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology) that enables the teaching and learning of every subject
* Scientific computing for the benefit of humanity, see section \@ref(rse). Creating better, cheaper and faster software and hardware for scientists and engineers, for example:
    - Improved climate modelling and weather forecasting
    - Quicker development of new vaccines and drugs, for example technologies like [Alphafold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold) are already making a difference to [drug discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery) [@Jumper2021]
    - Better healthcare, with [electronic health records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record), (EHR) [personal genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_genomics) and better diagnostic tools [@alphafoldeditorial]

## Breakpoints {#bp9}
(ref:breakpoint)

```md
* PAUSE ⏸️
```

* How closely do a given employers values align with your own? You may need to revisit section \@ref(no42).
    + You might not get a 100% match but you're unlikely to enjoy working for an employer where your values don't match very well at all
* Are the stated values of an employer the whole story?
    + Are there any unwritten or unspoken rules?
* Is there anything missing?
* Do the employers actions match their words? What an employer *says* and *does* may be contradictory. Actions speak louder than words
* What can computing do to tackle global challenges described in section \@ref(betterplace)

```md
* RESUME ▶️
```

Once you've thought about these questions, you stand a much better chance of working out if a given employer is a good match for you. So do you have to sell your soul as shown in figure \@ref(fig:soul-fig)? It depends on what you value and if an employer shares those values with you.

```

(ref:captionsoul) Here's a dilemma: Do you need to sell your soul to your employer? If so, how much can you get for it? What percentage stake of your soul will they ask for and how much are you willing to give? How do your values align with those of your employer?

## Summarising your choices {#tldr11}

[Too long, didn't read](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read) (TL;DR)? Here's a summary:

Your future is bright, your future needs choosing. Choosing your future will help you design your future. Designing your future will help you to start coding your future. 

This chapter has looked at the choices and options available to you as a student of computing. In the next part, chapter \@ref(computing): *Computing your Future* we'll take a broader look at why computing is a subject for everyone, not just Computer Scientists. 

If you're studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of your degree, you can probably skip this chapter which is aimed at a more general audience and go straight to chapter \@ref(debugging): *Debugging your Future* which will help you identify and fix bugs in your written job applications. 


This chapter is under construction because I'm using agile book development methods, see figure \@ref(fig:deathstar8-fig).

knitr::include_graphics("images/DeathStar2.jpg")
```
