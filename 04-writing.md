I often ask students about their motivation for studying Computer Science at University, you can hear some of their answers in chapter \@ref(hearing). One of my tutees^[who shall remain anonymous] once told me they chose to study computing because (quote): *I didn't like all the arty-farty humanities subjects at school. Literature, history, languages, culture, all those essays we had to write and debates about politics. Bla bla bla. I hated that stuff!* (unquote) My tutee preferred the precision and accuracy of mathematics and science. Fair enough, but while you can *run* from written and spoken communication, but you can't *hide* from it. Writing a CV, covering letter or filling in an application form is just the tip of the *natural language iceberg*, section \@ref(nle) outlines the some of the rest. This chapter looks at some simple techniques for improving and investing in your written communication skills.
