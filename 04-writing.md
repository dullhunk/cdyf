# Writing

Writing your thoughts down has multiple uses, or to use a programming metaphor, it is an [overloaded function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading). We need to examine some of these functions, because they are sometimes overlooked or taken for granted. If you don't like writing, remember that writing is actually your friend. So here are eight reasons why writing is your new [Best Friend Forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_friends_forever) (BFF). 

## Communication {#bff1}

Writing is communication. Well Duh! I'm stating the obvious, but you will sometimes hear software engineers talking disparingly about writing `documentation`. Writing about software can be a chore, that is done at the end, if there is time. This might go some way to explaining why some software documentation is so bad because:

* It's written as an afterthought
* It's might not written by the person who built it
* The author may not be able to empathise with the reader trying to use it
* It's been translated and mangled from another language 

Its worth stating the obvious but writing is about communication. Writing forces you to say exactly what you think. Whereas thoughts can be vague, writing that is vague doesn't communicate well. 



## Recording {#bff2}

Writing is about recording something that happened.

## Leadership {bff3}

Writing can be leadership too. Ever felt moved or influenced by a piece of writing? Writing specifies.

## Slowing down {#bff4}

Writing can help you slow down. Your brain tends to work more quickly that your fingers can type (or write). Your brain will often work faster than you can speak as well. So writing forces you to slow down and focus on a given topic or problem. 

## Problem solving {#bff5}

Ever got stuck on a difficult problem? Ever tried writing that problem down or articulating the problem to a rubber duck? There's something about writing a problem down or articulating a problem to another person. Even a rubber duck will do. So writing can be a useful technique for solving problems, even if nobody else reads what you've written. 



## Process not product {#bff6}

When you're writing a CV or a covering letter, the product of your writing is what is important. But sometimes, its the *process* of writing that matters more than the product. Here are some examplesl 

* Taking notes helps you concentrate on what the speaker is saying 
* Writing a diary or reflection forces you to analyse on what has happened, see section \@ref(reflecting)
* Writing down a problem helps you to solve it, as described in  section \@ref(bff5)
