# Writing

Writing your thoughts down has multiple uses, or to use a programming metaphor, it is an [overloaded function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading). We need to examine some of these functions, because they are sometimes overlooked or taken for granted. If you don't like writing, remember that writing is actually your friend. So here are eight reasons why writing is your new [Best Friend Forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_friends_forever) (BFF). 

## Communication {#bff1}

Writing is communication. Well Duh! I'm stating the obvious, because you will sometimes hear software engineers talking disparingly about writing the `documentation`. Sigh. Writing about software or hardware can be a chore, they will tell you. When engineers write about their software they often do it at the end, *if* there is time and *if* they can be bothered. This might go some way to explaining why software and hardware documentation can be so bad because:

* It is probably written as an afterthought or in a hurry
* It might not be authored by the person who designed or built the software
* The documentation may be describing complex processes or very abstract concepts
* It may have been mangled with the original meaning lost in translation to a different (natural) language
* The author may lack empathy with their readers 

A good example of this is the documentation for the distributed version control system [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). While `git` is a powerful tool, it is also quite complicated. Some of the documentation is very good [@progit] but other parts of it can tend towards inpenetrable jargon-ridden nonsense. Take this example describing a command known as `git-wave-stash` [@sigman07; @youtube-git]

```md
wave all staged stashes next to various cherry-picked non-applied applied trees
```

Can you work out what that actually means? Me neither. No doubt, you can think of many other examples where you've been reading documentation and thought `WTF`? This is just one example from many that shows why good writing is crucial for communication. 

Badly written text like the example above, fails to communicate with the reader. We've all been on the receiving end of badly written text, especially when it comes to software and hardware documentation. When its done well, writing communicates what needs to be communicated.


## Recording {#bff2}

What were you doing on the 6th March 2005? You probably don't know and you'll probably struggle to find out. I don't know either because I have no written records for that day. If I was an [obsessive–compulsive diarist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder), I'd have a written record of what happened to me on that day. But I'm not, so I don't. The point here is that, writing doesn't just communicate it also *records* what's happening. If it is important, it is probably worth writing down. Sometimes things you think are trivial are still worth writing down as they can come in handly later. 

* Minutes from a meeting 
* Lecture notes you've written
* A bug you've been working on including how you fixed it 

So besides communicating, writing records what happened. If you don't write it down, it might just disappear forever without trace. The person you'll be communicating with isn't just other people, it might be your future self. Your future you might really need to know, and it could save you *hours* of re-figuring out how to solve a problem you've already solved.

## Leadership {bff3}

Have ever felt moved or influenced by a piece of writing? Ever read something that motivated or influenced you in some way? Of course you have.

Why do people study the [United Sates Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence) more than 240 years after it was written? [@declarationofi] It's not just because it was influential, its because somebody bothered to write it down. The seemingly mundane act of low technology writing, as opposed to high technology. The declaration is just words, written down on a piece of paper, but words that changed the course of history. 

Whatever kind of revolution you want to start, you'll stand better chance of making it happen, if you write down your ideas in an way that people can clearly understand. This might include: 

* Getting a job interview, by crafting a persuasive covering letter and compellng CV 
* Encouraging people to join `projects` you've started, see section \@ref(mycvpj) 
* Negotiating terms and conditions of a contract of employment, you might start by email
* Getting someone to invest in your startup or offer you some freelance or contact work

So writing well won't just help you communicate and record, it will help you to become a more successful leader too by specifying exactly what's in your head.

## Slowing down {#bff4}

Your brain tends to work more quickly than your fingers can type or write. Your brain will often work faster than you can speak as well. Writing can slow that process down to something more manageable and concrete, by focussing on a given topic or problem. 

Writing forces you to say more *exactly* what you are thinking. Slowly. Whereas thoughts can be fast, vague and slippery, writing needs to be much more precise and accurate. Getting that level of precision and accuracy takes time, one of reasons writing can be challenging or lead to the dreaded [writer's block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block). [@whyiwrite]

## Problem solving {#bff5}

Ever got stuck on a difficult problem? Ever tried writing that problem down or articulating the problem to a rubber duck? There's something about writing a problem down or articulating a problem to another person. Even a rubber duck will do. So writing can be a useful technique for solving problems, even if nobody else reads what you've written. 

By the time you've written that [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) question about a techincal problem you are struggling to solve, your brain may have figured it out. This is much more likely to happen if you articulate the problem in words, either written down or spoken, to a rubber duck. 


## Process not product {#bff6}

When you're writing a CV or a covering letter, the *product* of your writing is the most important output. But sometimes, its the *process* of writing that matters more than the product. Here are some examples:

* Taking notes helps you concentrate on what the speaker is saying 
* Writing a reflection which forces you to analyse on what has happened and what you'll do next, see section \@ref(reflecting)
* Writing down a problem helps you to solve it, as described in  section \@ref(bff5)

So writing is important as a *process* as well as a *product*. 

## Therapy {#bff7}

If you're feeling anxious, writing down the things that are making you anxious may help you distance yourself from negative emotions. Likewise, if you're feeling depressed, articulating what makes you feel miserable could help you identify self-destructive emotions.

So writing can help you become more mindful of your thoughts, stepping outside the feelings to help you realise you are not your feelings. 

## Speeding up {#bff8}

As well as slowing your brain down, writing can also speed it up by *wicking* ideas like a [candle wick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_wick) does for candle wax. Without the wick, the candle wax can't undergo the chemical reaction to make carbon dioxide and water. As the software engineer Paul Graham puts it:  

> “If I can't write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets in the way of having the next. Pen and paper wick ideas”
> `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Paul Graham [@theislandtest]')`


Writing down your ideas or solutions will often help you generate new ones.
