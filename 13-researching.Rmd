# Researching your future {#researching}

So you want some more, eh? Your undergraduate degree has whetted your appetite. What are the options for postgraduate study and research? Where can they take you and will further study be worth investing your time and money in? You are a curious character. You like the idea of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge a little further, maybe you even fancy yourself as a modern day [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) or Alan Turing? üë©‚Äçüî¨üë®‚Äçüî¨

```

(ref:captioneinstein) I have no talents, I'm only passionately curious. Are you passionately curious? Is further study or research the right path for you? Are you the next Einstein or Einsteiness? This chapter looks at some of the possibilities for research and further study.

## What you will learn {#ilo12}  
At the end of this chapter you will be able to:

1. Describe the costs of postgraduate study and research
1. Discuss the benefits of postgraduate study and research


## Where to start {#finda}  
A good place to start if you're looking for a masters or PhD are:

* Apply directly to Universities for postgraduate study, if there is a specific group or course you are interested in. See also:
* [findamasters.com](https://www.findamasters.com/) for postgraduate study, a directory of Masters degrees and postgraduate qualifications at universities around the world
* [findaphd.com](https://www.findaphd.com/) for postgraduate research, a large database of PhD opportunities
* [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/) also lists PhD opportunities, not just in the UK

## University or Real World? {#realworld}
When you graduate, you might think you need to choose between University or the ‚Äú[real world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life)‚Äù, see figure \@ref(fig:realworld-fig). This is a false dichotomy and a popular misconception. In computing it is common for people to cross back and forth several times between industry (the so-called real world) and academia (the [ivory towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_tower)).

```{r realworld-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionrealworld)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/University-or-real-world.png")
```

(ref:captionrealworld) Which path will you choose, University or the real world? Perhaps you can you have both? How many times can you [zigzag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigzag) between the two? Real world sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Commercial or real-world experience is valuable in academia and academic experience is valuable beyond academia. So, if you think you need to choose between the two, think again. Doing an internship or placement with a commercial company can be useful background for a career in academia, both in research and teaching. Lots of research is done through partnerships between commercial companies and Universities, some of these create [startups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company), [University spin-offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_spin-off) or [corporate spin-offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off) etc.

Your learning shouldn't stop when you finish University either, so you might work for a bit, study for a bit, work a bit more and so on. Some of this learning might be formal and academic with qualifications, others might be badged in different ways. This is called [lifelong learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning), see section \@ref(lifelonglearning) and chapter \@ref(achieving).

So will you choose University **OR** real life in the longer term? With all the [squiggles and zigzags](https://www.amazingif.com/listen/), your career is likely to be a bit more complicated than that... [@squigglybook;]

## Signposts from here on research {#rsignposts}

A good place to start if you're thinking about doing a PhD (or trying to get through one) is *How to get your PhD: A Handbook for the Journey* by [Gavin Brown](https://twitter.com/profgavinbrown). [@howtogetyourphd]

I wish I'd had this book when I was a PhD student! I'm not just saying that because Gavin is a colleague of mine but this is a genuinely useful book which quickly tackles a wide range of issues you'll encounter during a PhD from the technical to the psychological. The second half also contains a range of short viewpoints on doing a PhD from people including [Nancy Rothwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Rothwell), [Victoria Burns](https://twitter.com/drvikkiburns), [Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber), [Lucy Kissick](https://www.lucykissick.co.uk/), [Hiranya Peiris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiranya_Peiris), [Melanie Leng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Leng), [Jeremy Wyatt](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jlw/), [David Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hand_(statistician)), [Carolyn Virca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolyn-virca-3446b558/), [Shakir Mohamed](https://shakirm.com/), [Jonny Brooks-Bartlett](https://medium.com/@jonnybrooks04) and [Jennifer Polk](https://fromphdtolife.com/). If you're serious about doing a PhD, you should read Gavin's guidebook.
