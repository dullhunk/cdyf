# Researching your future {#researching}

So you want some more, eh? Your undergraduate degree has whetted your appetite. What are the options for postgraduate study and research? Where can they take you and are they worth investing your time and money in? You are a curious character. You like the idea of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge a little further, maybe you even fancy yourself as the next [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) or Alan Turing? üë©‚Äçüî¨üë®‚Äçüî¨

```

(ref:captioneinstein) Are you passionately curious? Is further study or research the right path for you? Are you the next Einstein or Einsteiness? This chapter looks at the options.

## Signposts from here on research {#rsignposts}

A good place to start if you're thinking about doing a PhD (or trying to get through one) is *How to get your PhD: A Handbook for the Journey* by [Gavin Brown](https://twitter.com/profgavinbrown). [@howtogetyourphd] I wish I'd had this book when I was a PhD student! I'm not just saying that because Gavin is a colleague of mine but this is a genuinely useful book which quickly tackles a wide range of issues you'll encounter during a PhD from the technical to the psychological. The second half also contains a range of short viewpoints on doing a PhD from people including [Nancy Rothwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Rothwell), [Victoria Burns](https://twitter.com/drvikkiburns), [Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber), [Lucy Kissick](https://www.lucykissick.co.uk/), [Hiranya Peiris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiranya_Peiris), [Melanie Leng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Leng), [Jeremy Wyatt](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jlw/), [David Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hand_(statistician)), [Carolyn Virca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolyn-virca-3446b558/), [Shakir Mohamed](https://shakirm.com/), [Jonny Brooks-Bartlett](https://medium.com/@jonnybrooks04) and [Jennifer Polk](https://fromphdtolife.com/). If you're serious about doing a PhD, you should read Gavin's guidebook.

## Summarising further study and research {#tldr12}

[Too long, didn't read](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read) (TL;DR)? Here's a summary:

This chapter is under construction because I'm using agile book development methods, see figure \@ref(fig:deathstar9-fig).
