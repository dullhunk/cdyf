## Student Experience Internships (SEIs) {#seinterns}

The University of Manchester hosts its own summer internship scheme; Student Experience Internships (SEI), which has specific strands:

1. Charities offering project based roles within local organisations and an opportunity to gain experience and insights working in the Charity and not-for-profit sector.
1. Learning Through Research internships aimed at students wanting to explore what a PhD or academic career might look like.  These involve working alongside an academic member of staff or other researcher undertaking a very specific research project related to the academic's expertise.
1. Internships within Schools and the Professional Services of The University of Manchester (eg, Careers, Business Engagement, Alumni, Student Marketing, Sports) undertaking student experience, Welcome Week or employability focused projects.

All SEI internships are paid, full-time and last four to eight weeks across the summer vacation.  The SEI scheme is open to undergraduate, penultimate year students only.  If you are in receipt of a bursary or financial support from the University, you are able to apply for as many SEIs as you wish. However, if this is not the case and you do not receive a bursary or financial support you can apply for a maximum of 3 SEIs. Once you have accepted an SEI offer, you will be withdrawn from any other SEI roles that you have applied for.
