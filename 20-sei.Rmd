## Summer Internships in the School of Engineering {#seinterns}

The School of Engineering (SoE) at the University of Manchester (UoM) is now accepting applications for the 2026 Summer Internship scheme. An internship provides you with paid experience of working within The School of Engineering during summer 2026 to improve your skills while building your portfolio of projects.

All students must remain working in the UK for the duration of the internship and most internships will be fully based on campus. Some internships may have an option to complete part remotely - please check individual project descriptions for more information. 

There are many different projects to choose from, each with different supervisors and very different project outlines that you could be working on over the summer. By applying for one of our internships you are giving yourself a chance to develop your technical and transferable skills whilst gaining experience of working with an accomplished academic on a project that you are inspired by.  

Applications will be reviewed following the closing date and shortlisted candidates will be contacted and invited to the next stage of the process, which will be a video interview that will be reviewed by the project supervisor.


## Scheme Eligibility {#eligibility}

The scheme is open to registered Year 2 undergraduate students on a 3- or 4-year programme, as well as Year 3 undergraduate students on a 4-year programme at UoM. You may be on a BSc, BEng or MEng programme, and both home and international students are welcome to apply. 

You may only apply to a maximum of 3 internships (unless you are in receipt of a bursary or financial support from the University, in which case, you may choose to apply for more). These SoE internships are open to students from multiple disciplines within the School of Engineering. Please see each advert for further information on which disciplines can apply.

Students who have previously undertaken an internship through this scheme are unfortunately not eligible to apply again. The purpose of the scheme is to provide valuable and relevant work experience that Engineering students can include on their CVs, which in turn should increase the chances of securing external opportunities at a later point.

## Projects available in 2026, closing 20th Feb {#soenterns}
