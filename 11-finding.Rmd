# Finding your future {#finding}

So, you've successfully debugged your CV, with help from chapters \@ref(debugging), \@ref(hacking) and \@ref(verbalising). You've reflected on who you are in chapter \@ref(exploring) and identified where you can improve your `experience` as described in chapter \@ref(experiencing).  Now, how can find an interesting job? How can use your CV, covering letter and any other (mostly written) communication to persuade employers to invite you to an interview? What techniques exist and how can you use your networks to help you? Where can you look? This chapter will help you find your future. üî≠

Your future is bright, your future needs finding, so let's start finding your future.

## What you will learn {#ilo8}
At the end of this chapter you will be able to:

1. Formulate job search strategies:
    + by role, sector, skills, time, size, quantity, values, culture, network, salary and location
1. Apply your search strategies to advertised (and unadvertised) opportunities
    + Identify opportunities for finding work, online and face-to-face
    + Identify people in your existing networks who can help you
    + Grow your networks and use them to your advantage
1. Describe some of the problems with recruitment:
    + for employers
    + for potential employees (like you)
    + Critically evaluate what employers have on offer (beyond the financial incentives)


<!--
* Compare your values and ethics with those of employer
* Decide, plan and compete kent-->

<!--* Describe what it means to be **employable**-->

## Job search strategies {#strategies}
Before we look at where to look for jobs, we need to discuss what to look for. Let's imagine there is a handy AI-powered function in python called `find_jobs()` which knows *everything* about:

* all the jobs available, regardless of where they are advertised, including hidden ones (see Jonathan's story of finding hidden jobs in chapter \@ref(jonathan))
* all of your skills, knowledge, values and ambitions
* every employer in the world, their services, products and values
* everyone in your social and professional networks, right from first degree connections through to [sixth degree connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) [@bacon]

Such a function doesn't really exist yet, but let's pretend that it does to illustrate some points about job searching. If you were to run the function with no arguments...

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/6f3a98ca6ae2cdcb611f8b4838fe25df.js"></script>')
```

```{r, eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('see https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/6f3a98ca6ae2cdcb611f8b4838fe25df')
```

...you will be completely overwhelmed with the results. It can be bewildering knowing where to start your job search, because the possibilities are endless. Your [search space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_space) is huge. It's like trying to drink from a high-pressure [fire hose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_hose), see figure \@ref(fig:firehose-fig).

```{r firehose-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfirehose)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/firehose.png")
```
(ref:captionfirehose) Are you thirsty for job opportunities? If you try to `find_jobs()` without any parameters, you will be overwhelmed by the options, like the graduate in this picture.

Thankfully, we can break it down, but there are many parameters and variables in your search that you need to think about. Here are some basic strategies to help you start to [decompose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)) the complex problem of job hunting into smaller, more manageable problems you can start to tackle. We've already mentioned some:

1. üë®‚Äçüî¨ search by role, see section \@ref(by-role)
1. üìä search by sector, see section \@ref(by-sector)
1. üí™ search by skills, see section \@ref(by-skills)
1. üåç search by location, see section \@ref(by-location)
1. üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ search by network, see section \@ref(weakties)
1. üí∞ search by salary, see section \@ref(by-salary)
1. üèãÔ∏è search by size, see section \@ref(by-size)
1. ‚ù§Ô∏è search by values, see section \@ref(by-values)
1. üï∞ search by timing, see section \@ref(by-time)
1. ‚öñÔ∏è search by quantity, see section \@ref(by-quantity)

Each strategy has is own strengths and weaknesses, so you'll probably want to combine more than one and experiment with different strategies as your search progresses over time. No doubt, you'll have some extra strategies of your own, this is not meant to be an exhaustive list, just a starting point:

### Search by role {#by-role}
There are many different roles that studying computing gives you access to besides software engineering. So one strategy is to research the roles described in section \@ref(otheroles), focus on some you like the sound of and then apply for those kinds of roles. Let's say you are interested in `software engineering`. This is a strategy that will help you narrow down a huge number of jobs into something more manageable. For example:

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/c13ddb4dbd5c43220cd35caa5d1f40c7.js"></script>')
```

```{r, eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('see https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/c13ddb4dbd5c43220cd35caa5d1f40c7')
```

The list of roles in section \@ref(otheroles) will give you a flavour of some roles to think about, beyond software engineering.

### Search by sector {#by-sector}
Computing is found in every sector of business and society. This means you won't just find computing jobs in the technology sector. Although the lines between some sectors are becoming increasingly blurred, you can still narrow down your options by picking a sector you are interested in and pursuing that. For example:


```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/ecc64065d98a45b54ed178f370af6abf.js"></script>')
```

```{r, eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('see https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/ecc64065d98a45b54ed178f370af6abf')
```

Like many graduate employment guides, the Guardian 300 guide (see section \@ref(studentjobs)) has good overview of different sectors by breaking down employers by sectors such as:

* Consulting
* Public sector
* Finance

Picking a sector can help you get started, by narrowing what might otherwise be a massive search space. The sector(s) you choose will also determine the kind of salary you can expect, see section \@ref(by-salary). 

I've got the brains, you've got the looks, let's make lots of money. [@letsmakelotsofmoney]

### Search by skills {#by-skills}
Is there a specific skill you have that you enjoy using, or a technology you think has a promising future? You could use this as a way to find jobs, for example:

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/61bf8c20b4eb2da9a168ebb29b7026fd.js"></script>')
```

```{r, eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('see https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/61bf8c20b4eb2da9a168ebb29b7026fd')
```

Picking a specific technology can sometimes help you narrow down the options, for example by using these keywords in your search.

### Search by location {#by-location}
If you were an [estate agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_agent), you might argue that the three most important parameters of your job search are:

1. Location [@location]
1. Location [@location]
1. Location [@location]

So pick a location: Manchester? London? Paris? Berlin? New York? [Silly Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley)? [WFH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work)? The location(s) you choose will determine the options that are available:

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/5004cbf5fc337fb8e7357e62c50d15eb.js"></script>')
```

```{r, eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('see https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/5004cbf5fc337fb8e7357e62c50d15eb')
```
 ... and so on. So locations can help you define (and potentially reduce) your search space. For example, if you're looking in Manchester, you can get started at [git.io/manc](https://git.io/manc). Picking a location can also help you identify networking opportunities for hidden, un-advertised vacancies and making speculative applications, described in section \@ref(speculative). You could find out about employers by attending free [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) or [eventbrite.com](https://www.eventbrite.com/) events in your chosen location. See section \@ref(jonetwork) of Jonathan's story in chapter \@ref(jonathan). Since its a big subject, there's more information on searching by location in chapter \@ref(moving).

### Search by network {#weakties}
The people in your network can help you find work. *[It's not what you know, its who you know](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it%27s_not_what_you_know_but_who_you_know)*, or so the clich√© goes. [@newfads] The bigger your network, the more opportunities you'll know about. So a really basic strategy for finding jobs is using your networks. Remember, our `find_jobs` does just know what you know, it also knows who is in your professional `network` and the employers *they* know about, so we could ask it to find opportunities in your professional and social networks:

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/c2e05b55e55c285de8525a6952731f30.js"></script>')
```

```{r, eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('see https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/c2e05b55e55c285de8525a6952731f30')
```

Your close network probably won't change that much, the friends and family you trust and rely on. Its important to recognise the importance of more casual acquaintances, or what sociologist [Mark Granovetter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter) calls  ‚Äúweak ties‚Äù. [@granovetter]

```{r bumped-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbumped)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Bumped into.png")
```
(ref:captionbumped) It's not what you know, its who you know: Networking and personal contacts can be more useful than just knowledge and skills alone, when seeking employment. Networking is an essential part of any job search, your networks can help you now and in the future. One of the things looked at in this chapter is how to build and use your networks to help find the job you're after. The simplest networking technique is bumping into people, but you need create opportunities for that to happen. Bumped into sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

 Weak ties are people you don't know as well, but are important for a range of reasons. Research has shown that [building networks of weak ties is good for your mental health and can give you an edge in job hunting](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-why-your-weak-tie-friendships-may-mean-more-than-you-think). [@weakties] Granovetter showed that many job opportunities came through weak ties, rather than strong ones. This is true not just of jobs early on in your career (like now) but also later too. So it is in your interests to continually foster weak connections and be open to serendipitous meetings where you bump into people, as in Figure \@ref(fig:bumped-fig). ‚ÄúBumping into‚Äù here, could mean either physical or virtual.

```{r net-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionnetworks)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/grow your networks.png")
```

(ref:captionnetworks) Who is in your network? Grow and use your network, both the strong ties and the weak ties. Weak ties are often the most important when it comes to job hunting.

<!--### Academics

Academics have careers too, and some will have extensive networks of contacts in industry and academia that might be useful to you. If you ask nicely, they might introduce you to people they know who can help, such as former students or collaborators.

### Search by salary {#by-salary}
You can also define your search space by salary:

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/28c308ee12c067b95dd724eabfc9e291.js"></script>')
```

```{r, eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('see https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/28c308ee12c067b95dd724eabfc9e291')
```

Setting a minimum salary will include or exclude certain employers from your search. To do this realistically, you need to know how much you are worth, see section \@ref(undersell) and figure \@ref(fig:salaries-fig) for some places to start.


```{r salaries-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionsalaries)"}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
salaries <- tribble(
  ~year, ~salary,
  2007, 24500,
  2008, 25500,
  2009, 27000,
  2010, 29000,
  2011, 29000,
  2012, 29000,

  2024, 34000
 )

ggplot(data = salaries) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = year, y = salary), stat = "identity")

```


(ref:captionsalaries) Average graduate starting salaries (in ¬£) at the UK‚Äôs ‚Äútop‚Äù employers 2007 to 2024, according to [highfliers.co.uk](https://www.highfliers.co.uk) [@highfliers2024] Since 2007, graduate salaries have risen from `¬£24,500` to `¬£34,000` in 2024. Note that these are *graduate* salaries, not internship or placement salaries which tend to be lower. Also note that ‚Äútop‚Äù employers is a highly subjective judgement, lots of good smaller employers don't feature in this data and they typically pay less than the large multinational employers dominating this sample. The averages also hide significant variations by sector and location, see the salary resources in section \@ref(undersell)


### Search by size {#by-size}
Do you see yourself working for a large multi-national corporation or a bedroom startup? Perhaps you prefer something in-between? There's advantages and disadvantages to each, but like all our other parameters, picking an organisation size can help you get started. In some cases, size will also define the `type` or organisation, for example:

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/5ec7d37a60637c7083dc661e74ddcaf9.js"></script>')
```

```{r, eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('see https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/5ec7d37a60637c7083dc661e74ddcaf9')
```

Likewise, if you know you want to work for a multi-national, that gives you a list of employers you can target. Picking a size, can help you identify employers you would like to work for. Table \@ref(tab:shortcuts) summarises some of the when and where some employers typically advertise.

```{r shortcuts, echo = FALSE}
job_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ ""       , ~ "Large employers", ~ "SMEs",
  "Where"    , "Advertise broadly", "Less likely to advertise on big jobs boards",
  "When"     , "Vacancies open earlier in the academic year", "Vacancies *tend* to open later in the academic year",
  "How"      , "Typically multistage applications, several rounds of interviews", "Typically shorter application and interview processes",
  "Who"      , "Typically receive high volume of applications per vacancy", "Typically receive lower volume of applications per vacancy",
  "Process"  , "Unlikely to consider speculative applications", "May consider speculative or informal applications",
)
knitr::kable(job_table, caption = "The practicalities of applying for vacancies, internships, placements, graduate jobs and schemes in large multinational employers compared to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)", booktabs = TRUE)
```

### Search by values {#by-values}
Besides the mundane importance of balancing the books, what does a given employer actually value? How do an employers values match your own, the `values_match` below? Reasonably or not at all? How much of your soul do you need to sell? All of it, or just some of it? This a difficult question to compute, see section \@ref(soul), but let's imagine we can:

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/015a1182225f13c9307538468620ceb9.js"></script>')
```

```{r, eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('see https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/015a1182225f13c9307538468620ceb9')
```

An employers `values` are usually reflected in its organisational `culture`. What is the employers culture like? What sort of structure would you fit into, see figure \@ref(fig:pyramid-fig)? Would you enjoy working there and would you felt like you belonged? How can you actually find this out? Do you need to sell your soul? If you're struggling with these questions, you may need to do some more soul searching, see section \@ref(soul) and chapter \@ref(exploring). Talk to employees too, this is why networking is important, see section \@ref(weakties).

```{r pyramid-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionpyramid)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Manu_Cornet_pyramid.png")
```
(ref:captionpyramid) Culture and values are often reflected in an employers structure. Finding out about an employers structure will help you begin to understand their `culture` and `values`, see section \@ref(soul).

Our `find_jobs()` function is useful, if only as a [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment), but there's still the strategic questions of *when* you use the function and *how often* so lets look at those next.

### Search by timing {#by-time}
For graduates and undergraduates, the time of year you are looking can determine what jobs you can look for. At the beginning of the academic year in September you might target large multinational organisations. If you're not successful, you could switch to smaller employers later in the academic year. For example ‚ÄúIt's October, so I'm applying to large employers‚Äù or:

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/83030d66f53da3d664f6cd3ed7746a36.js"></script>')
```

```{r, eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cat('see https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/83030d66f53da3d664f6cd3ed7746a36')
```

Armed with knowledge of *when* to apply you can start to target employers. Timing is important because in some cases it will determine the `type` of organisation you apply to.

### Search by quantity {#by-quantity}
Should you optimise the *quantity* of your applications or the  *quality*, see figure \@ref(fig:blunderbuss-fig)? Will your job applications be like a [brute-force attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack) or something more targeted?

```{r blunderbuss-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionblunderbuss)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Blunderbuss.png")
```
(ref:captionblunderbuss) As you target employers, what will your strategy be? At one extreme you could optimise the *quantity* of your applications, aiming to do as many as you can. This is shown in the left of the picture by the [blunderbuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunderbuss) (or [scattergun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattergun)) strategy. You make *lots* of applications but don't target or tailor them much in the hope that *some* will hit the target if you point your weapon (that's your CV) in approximately the general direction of your target employer. At the other extreme you could optimise the *quality* of your applications by spending more time researching the employer and carefully aiming your shots like a sniper would, in the right of the figure. Which strategy is best? Blunderbuss sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

Figure \@ref(fig:blunderbuss-fig) shows two extreme approaches to job hunting, in reality you'll probably want to strike a balance between *quality* and *quantity*. Finding jobs by quantity can set a pace and rhythm to your job search:

```md
* ‚ÄúI will do one application per week during term time‚Äù
```

or set a time limit for what you're prepared to do:

```md
* ‚ÄúI'll spend two hours per week finding and applying for jobs‚Äù
```

If you find yourself:

* Making a small number of applications, you may need to consider applying more widely and spending *less time* on each application
* Making a large number of applications, you may need to consider applying less and spending  *more time* on each application


This raises the question, how big is a *small* or a *large* number of job applications, which isn't easy to answer. Doing fifty applications over a couple of months may mean the quality of each application is too low.


## Where can you for look for jobs? {#looking}
Using our fictional `find_jobs` function we've described and discussed some basic strategies to get you started. Sadly no such function exists yet, so armed with a rough idea of what you're looking for, where can you actually look?

The marketplace for job searching and job hunting advice is *incredibly* overcrowded. Employers spend huge amounts of money on recruitment and this is reflected in the enormous range of jobs boards, which are often accompanied by advice on job hunting. There are five basic kinds of places you can look for jobs:

1. üéì Undergraduate and graduate jobs boards, such as [gradcracker.com](https://www.gradcracker.com) and your University jobs board e.g. [CareerConnect](https://careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk) etc see \@ref(studentjobs)
1. üëÄ General jobs boards and search engines that index them, such as Google jobs, see section \@ref(generaljobs)
1. üé® Portfolio style, such as LinkedIn, Github and others which allow you to publish a public profile, see section \@ref(portfolio)
1. üé∞ Speculation, approaching employers to find out about un-advertised vacancies, see section \@ref(speculative)
1. üïµÔ∏è Recruiters, get a recruiter to help you, see section \@ref(recruiters)

### For graduates and undergraduates {#studentjobs}

### For any job seekers {#generaljobs}
The following resources are aimed at *anyone* (not just undergraduates and graduates) looking for jobs *anywhere* in the world. Let's start with Google job search shown in figure \@ref(fig:googlejobs-fig).

```{r googlejobs-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongooglejobsearch)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/google-job-search.jpg")
```
(ref:captiongooglejobsearch) Keywords like `job`, `internship` and `engineer` in an ordinary (vanilla) google search will trigger Google's job search product, an enhanced search feature that aggregates listings from many different jobs boards. Here's an example from clicking through on the results of a Google search for `software internship` ([google.com/search?q=software+internship](https://www.google.com/search?q=software+internship)). You can refine your search results by `title`, `location` (my IP address means that `Manchester` has been selected automatically), `date posted`, `type`, `company type` and `employer` shown across the top of the screenshot. See the text below for more examples.

Google job search is a good starting point because it crawls and indexes lots of different jobs boards. It doesn't index *everything*, see [Google's job hunting service comes to UK](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44853472) [@noindeed], but its a pretty good place to start.

* Google job search indexes jobs advertised by many of the resources mentioned in this chapter. You can use google job search to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven't used it already try the searches below. Unlike other services, Google job search works by indexing embedded [microdata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)) structured using [schema.org/JobPosting](https://schema.org/JobPosting). Keywords like `job` and `internship` in an ordinary (vanilla) google search will trigger the job search product, as shown in the following examples:

    -[google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester](https://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester)

    -[google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern](https://www.google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern)

    -[google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer](https://www.google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer)

    -[google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london](https://www.google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london)

    -[google.com/search?q=data+scientist+intern](https://www.google.com/search?q=data+scientist+intern)

    -[google.com/search?q=research+software+engineer+job](https://www.google.com/search?q=research+software+engineer+job)

    -Google job search is an impressive product, see [grow.google/job-seekers](https://grow.google/job-seekers) but it doesn't index *everything*. If you're looking for a job AT google, they have moved from [jobs.google.com](https://jobs.google.com/about/) to [careers.google.com](https://careers.google.com/), see also section \@ref(bignames)

* [startupgradjobs.com](https://www.startupgradjobs.com/) and [workinstartups.com](https://workinstartups.com) if you're interested in smaller employers
* [glassdoor.co.uk](http://www.glassdoor.co.uk/) is like tripadvisor for jobs. Find out what it's *really* like to work for given employers from current and former employees. A student oriented version can be found at [glassdoor.com/Students](https://www.glassdoor.com/Students), this means you can use it without writing a review of a previous employer (which is what non-student users have to do to access the content)
*  [HiPEAC jobs](https://www.hipeac.net/jobs) (High Performance and Embedded Architecture and Compilation) is good for jobs in hardware, supercomputing and related fields
*  [Indeed.com](http://www.indeed.com), [adzuna.co.uk](https://www.adzuna.co.uk), [cwjobs.co.uk](https://www.cwjobs.co.uk/), [fish4.co.uk](https://www.fish4.co.uk), [reed.co.uk](https://www.reed.co.uk/), [totaljobs.com](https://www.totaljobs.com), [monster.co.uk](https://www.monster.co.uk), [jobs.smartrecruiters.com](https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com), [cv-library.co.uk](https://www.cv-library.co.uk), [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk) are general jobs boards that also advertise jobs for students and graduates, alongside many other vacancies. Many (but not all) of these jobs boards are indexed by Google job search described above, so you don't have to visit them all.
* [Otta.com](https://otta.com/) for people with 0-10 years experience. From engineering to sales, discover jobs & internships at London\'s most innovative companies.

### Pushing a public professional profile {#portfolio}
Jobs boards use the **pull** approach to job hunting, you search for and pull vacancies of interest. Alongside this, you can also try a **push** approach by publishing a professional public profile online.

Publishing a portfolio of your work online will allow employers and recruiters to come and find you, as well as you searching for them. Employers shouldn't expect you to have an online portfolio and you might not want to have one, but it can help. If you choose to have a public profile, you can link to it in the header of your CV, see section \@ref(header).

* **LinkedIn.com** is a social media service which allows you to put professional details online, a bit like a semi-public or public CV, see figure \@ref(fig:linkedin-fig) and table \@ref(tab:linkedintable). Besides allowing you to advertise yourself, LinkedIn also:
    + advertises job vacancies [linkedin.com/jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)
    + enables you to [let recruiters know you're looking for work](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a507508/let-recruiters-know-you-re-open-to-work) [@privatelysignal]
    + allows you to [apply for jobs directly through LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/75815/applying-for-jobs-on-linkedin?lang=en) although [making fast applications is not always a good thing](https://medium.com/otta-blog/job-boards-making-fast-applications-is-not-a-good-thing-5a4970887ecd) [@fastapplications]
    + provides tutorials for students to get started [linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students)
    + can help you build your professional network, for example by connecting alumni from your University via the [LinkedIn alumni tab](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a567083/linkedin-page-alumni-tab-overview). See [linkedin.com/school/university-of-manchester/people](https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-manchester/people/) and [your.manchester.ac.uk/get-involved/global-networks](https://your.manchester.ac.uk/get-involved/global-networks/). Whatever Unviersity you are studying at, LinkedIn can be a good way finding, contacting and connecting with alumni

```{r linkedin-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionlinkedin)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/linkedin-profile.jpg")
```
(ref:captionlinkedin) [Linkedin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn) is a social media service which allows you to build a professional network and public profile. It also allows employers to advertise their job vacancies. Social media caveats aside (see section \@ref(signposts3)), LinkedIn can be useful tool for networking with other professionals and finding a job, see table \@ref(tab:linkedintable). You can see Polly's profile at [linkedin.com/in/pollymorphism](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pollymorphism/)

* **Github.com** allows you to publish code in public repositories that everyone can see, see figure \@ref(fig:github-fig). If you're comfortable doing it, publishing your software online can be a good way of demonstrating your technical skills and knowledge but be careful publishing your coursework online, see section \@ref(projects). Nothing says ‚Äú*I can build software*‚Äù  quite like ‚Äú*here's one I made earlier*‚Äù. [@bluepeter]

```{r github-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongithub)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/amish-github.jpg")
```
(ref:captiongithub) Github is commonly used to host open source software development projects. As of June 2022, GitHub reported having over 83 million developers and more than 200 million repositories, including at least 28 million public repositories. The screenshot shows a profile of Computer Science student Amish Shah: [github.com/amishshah](https://github.com/amishshah) Thanks Amish for permission to use your profile as an example, find out more about Amish in chapter \@ref(amish).

* **Stackoverflow.com** You've probably already cut-and-pasted solutions from the question and answer forum Stack Overflow. You can also create a profile on Stack Overflow too, see figure \@ref(fig:overflow-fig). As of March 2021 the site had over 14 million registered users, and had received over 21 million questions and 31 million answers.

```{r overflow-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionoverflow)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pezoverflow.png")
```
(ref:captionoverflow) An example of using stackoverflow to create a public profile by asking and answering technical questions online. The screenshot shows a profile of former Computer Science student Pez Cuckow: [stackoverflow.com/users/193376/pez-cuckow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/193376/pez-cuckow)

So, if you're happy to publish your work online, services like LinkedIn, Github and Stackoverflow can help you find jobs using a *push* approach alongside more conventional *pull* approaches described in section \@ref(studentjobs) and \@ref(generaljobs). They can also be used to augument your CV, with the stuff that doesn't fit onto one or two printed pages. Digital profiles can be also be useful if you're looking for freelance, contract or part-time work.

### Speculative applications {#speculative}

Some job vacancies are not advertised. Employers may deliberately hide them or make them difficult to find so they aren't swamped with lots of unsuitable applicants. Smaller employers do not always offer the kinds of experience described in section \@ref(areuexperienced). In these cases, a speculative application might the only way to get a foot in the door, see figure \@ref(fig:gambling-fig). In popular sectors which can be harder to break into like [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game), a speculative application is worth considering alongside getting a recruiter to help you, described in section \@ref(recruiters).

```{r gambling-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongambling)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gambling.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiongambling) Are you playing your cards right? The stakes are high in the game of employment because there might be a job in it for you. Like [gambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling), speculative applications can sometimes pay off, especially for hidden or unadvertised vacancies. You will improve your chances and strengthen your hand by researching the employer (see section \@ref(bp10)), using your professional networks to connect and playing your (computational) joker, see section \@ref(joker). Public domain image of *[The Cardsharps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cardsharps)*, a painting by [Caravaggio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravaggio) on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/6R6q](https://w.wiki/6R6q) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238) ‚ô£‚ô•‚ô†‚ô¶üÉè

To improve your chances of winning the bets placed in your speculative applications you need to: 

* Do some research about the employer, see section \@ref(bp10)
* Make sure you've debugged your CV or r√©sum√©, see section \@ref(checklist)
* Have written a compelling and personalised covering letter, see section \@ref(covering-letters) 

Your speculative application might take several different forms: 

* traditional CV and covering letter, by email see section \@ref(covering-letters)
* Phone call, these can work well with smaller employers, have your (verbal) ‚Äúelevator pitch‚Äù ready see section \@ref(covering-letters)
* Digital or virtual approach, eg. via LinkedIn or similar see section \@ref(portfolio)
* Speaking to employers in person e.g. at networking or other public events [IRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life)

Whatever form your speculative application takes, the networks that we described in section \@ref(weakties) can be useful in approaching employers including:

* **virtual**: people you've met online, for example in places like those described in section \@ref(portfolio)  
* **actual**: people you've met in real-time face to face, offline and [IRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life#Related_terminology) 
* **professional** contacts: employers who have visited your University or you know via some other means
* **personal** contacts: friends, family, fellow students etc 

Making speculative applications may involve you [cold calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_calling) employers, by email, phone or online. It's a bit of a gamble, but it can sometimes work. The people in your networks can help you to make job applications that aren't completely cold.

Smaller employers are more likely to be receptive to speculative job applications than larger employers. While speculative applications are a gamble, sometimes they will pay off.


### What about recruiters? {#recruiters}

Recruiters can help you find work and they operate in every industry sector. They are sometimes called ‚Äúhead-hunters‚Äù, and there are two basic kinds that can help you:

1. Recruiters employed directly by an employer, for example in the human resources (HR) department of a given organisation.
1. Recruiters who are self-employed or work for a recruitment agency. They typically earn money from the number of interview candidates and successful hires they provide for their clients. They are often deliberately coy about who their clients are.

Recruiters are usually not technical people, so don't expect them to any knowledge of software engineering (for example) - that isn't usually their skill set. Although recruiters can help you, it is worth being wary of recruiters as shown in figure \@ref(fig:recruiter-fig), especially if they work for an agency rather than being directly employed by the organisation you are interested in.

```{r recruiter-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionrecruiter)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/recruiters-are.png")
```
(ref:captionrecruiter) The autocomplete algorithm of a well known search engine gives you an idea of what *some* people think about *some* recruiters. This doesn't mean you should avoid recruiters completely, just be careful how you use their services and pay close attention to who they work for.

Some recruiters are very good and can help you, especially if they work direclty for the employer you are interested. There are some recruitment agencies that specialise in helping employers recruit graduates, these may be useful to you. Others specialise in particular sectors such as [aswift.com](https://www.aswift.com/) who focus on video game development. Some [executive search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_search) firms specialise in fields where employers struggle to find suitable candidates, such as computing.

However some recruiters are not very good, and don't always provide a valued service for employers or potential employees like you. This is why you sometimes see `no recruiters` or `no agencies` on job adverts. So be wary of recruiters, and remember that some recruiters work primarily for their clients (employers) not you.

In most cases you shouldn't have to pay recruiters up front but job scammers will sometimes pose as recruiters so beware. Talking of job scammers, there's some things you need to be wary of when you are job hunting:

## Buyer beware {#beware}
When you're looking for job you're acting as both a buyer *and* a seller.

1. **SELLING**: You're selling your services in a marketplace, for the best price you can get
1. **BUYING**: You're buying into the culture and values of an employer (see section \@ref(soul)), who are trying to sell themselves to you.

As a buyer and seller, you should be wary of the following:

* ü§ï  Broken recruitment practices: section \@ref(broken)
* ‚è∞  Time sink: section \@ref(timesink)
* ü§£  Over-specified jobs: section \@ref(overspec)
* üò≠  Unpaid internships: section \@ref(unpaid)
* üìà  Overselling: section \@ref(oversell)
* üìâ  Underselling: section \@ref(undersell)
* ü§î  Compromises: section \@ref(compromises)
* ü§•  Job scammers: section \@ref(scams)
* üê∑  Job spammers: section \@ref(spamming)
* ü§Æ  Rejection: section \@ref(rejection)
* üé¢  The rollercoaster: section \@ref(rollercoaster)

### Beware of broken recruitment practices {#broken}

There's no shortage of people saying that recruitment and hiring are broken in various ways, see figure \@ref(fig:stroustrup-fig). 

```{r stroustrup-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionstroustrup)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bjarne-stroustrup.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionstroustrup) According to the creator of the C++ programming language, [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup):  ‚Äú*There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses*‚Äù. [@stroustrup] The same principle can be applied to hiring, there are only two kinds of recruitment practices, *the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses*. CC [BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) portrait of Stroustrup by Julia Kryuchkova on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/GA3](https://w.wiki/GA3) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Here is a small sample of complaints about recruitment, both from employers and employees. First, on dodgy CVs and r√©sum√©s:

* ‚Äú*Is the CV is dead*‚Äù [@howtohire]
* ‚Äú*Should you change your name to get a job?*‚Äù [@changeyourname;@homophily;@emilyandgreg]
* ‚Äú*Can anonymous CVs help beat recruitment discrimination?*‚Äù [@anoncv;@kang]

... and the fallibility of the interview process... 

* ‚Äú*Job interviews are a nightmare ‚Äî and only getting worse*‚Äù [@worse] 
* ‚Äú*Why you should never consent to a coding test in an interview*‚Äù [@nocode]
* ‚Äú*I cheated on my Microsoft interview*‚Äù [@cheated]
* ‚Äú*What are some common criticisms of Cracking the Coding interview?*‚Äù [@murashenkov]

... and the general unreliability of hiring ... 

* ‚Äú*Your approach to hiring is all wrong*‚Äù [@capelli]
* ‚Äú*It's time to streamline the hiring process*‚Äù [@streamline]
* ‚Äú*Why does hiring take so long? Can't they speed things up?*‚Äù [@solong]
* ‚Äú*Hiring is broken. Here‚Äôs why... and what it should be like instead*‚Äù [@brokenhiring]
* [google.com/search?q=hiring+is+broken](https://www.google.com/search?q=hiring+is+broken) ... documents a bottomless pit of pain, frustration and suffering! 

Despite their [Americentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americentrism) approach, these articles raise important points. Many of them claim that while hiring is broken, they've got a solution to fix it. There's no escaping the fact that the personnel an organisation chooses to hire is one of the most important decisions it can make. Consequently, hiring the *wrong* people can lead to all sorts of (expensive) problems. Unfortunately, it seems likely that important decisions on hiring will remain complicated, time consuming and error-prone.

So beware of broken recruitment practices. Hiring is broken. Recruitment can be biased, bureaucratic, discriminatory, expensive, inefficient and painful for many people. It can be unfair and doesn't always select the best candidates for the post anyway. Hiring is not just unncessarily unpleasant for you, it's the same for employers too. Knowing this will help you prepare for its many limitations and be patient.

So, if you're finding your job hunt unpleasant, you are not alone. Many recruitment practices are flawed but they are probably the ‚Äúleast worst‚Äù system we have, at least for now. 

*We are experiencing some turbulence in recruitment. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.* ü§ï


### Beware of the time sink {#timesink}
Finding employers that you are interested in and submitting high quality job applications takes lots of time. Many students under estimate the time needed to job hunt. It can be a very time consuming process for everyone, both employers and candidates alike, see figure \@ref(fig:timesink-fig).

```{r timesink-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiontimesink)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/timesink.jpeg")
```
(ref:captiontimesink) Playing the game of job hunting can be a big drain on your time and some time wasting is unfortunately inevitable. Employers will waste some of your valuable time and you'll probably waste some of theirs too. Beware of the recruitment [time sink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_sink). Public domain image of a DualShock PlayStation controller by [Evan Amos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Amos) on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3VFp](https://w.wiki/3VFp) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Even after you have managed to:

1. Identify and articulate your skills and knowledge, see chapter \@ref(exploring)
1. Understand what you're interested in, see chapter \@ref(exploring)
1. Update your CV, see chapter \@ref(debugging)
1. Consider all your options, see chapter \@ref(choosing)
1. Target employers or sectors of interest

.. the actual business of applying described in this chapter can be very bureaucratic. Any interviews you have will take time to prepare for (see chapter \@ref(speaking)) and you've got loads of other calls on your time like studying and having a social life.

One way to tackle this problem is to schedule some time every week when you work on applications, see chapter \@ref(organising). However, there's no getting away from the fact that finding a job can consume a significant amount of your time. So beware of the time sink. ‚è∞


### Beware of over-specified jobs {#overspec}
Employers and recruiters routinely over-specify job descriptions, see figure \@ref(fig:impossible-fig). A good example of this is, when the [Swift programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) was first publicly released in 2014 at the [Apple Worldwide Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference) (WWDC) in California, job adverts instantly appeared asking for programmers with `5 years experience in Swift`! How can *anyone* have five years experience in a programming language that's only just been made public?! Aside from the people who developed the language, like [Chris Lattner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner), the recruiters and employers must have had a *long* search trying to find their candidate. It must have taken them at least five years!

```{r impossible-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionimpossible)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/were-looking-for-someone.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionimpossible) ‚Äú*We're looking for someone aged 22-26 with 30 years of experience*‚Äù... Sometimes employers have impossible requirements so not meeting all of them shouldn't stop you applying. Meme from [starecat.com](https://starecat.com/) 

<!--https://twitter.com/dullhunk/status/1551249500894896130-->

The moral of this Apple story above is, if you don't meet *all* the criteria in a job specification, that shouldn't stop you applying. Most job adverts are over-specified as wishful employers dream up their ideal candidate.^[Using a relationship analogy, describe your ideal romantic partner. PAUSE. How many people are actually likely to have ALL of those attributes?] Many employers will overstate their requirements in the hope they get their dream candidate. You might look at the job description and think, *I've only got 70% of what they're asking for, so I won't bother applying*. The reality is, if you've got 60% of what they are asking for, you should probably apply. It's unlikely that *anyone* will meet 100% of the job requirements.

If you see things on job adverts you don't understand or are not sure about, go and find out about them. There's a good chance it will be similar to something you already know about, or you can self-educate yourself to fill any gaps. But beware of employers over-specifying jobs. ü§£

### Beware of unpaid internships {#unpaid}
In the UK, it is illegal to employ people without paying them a salary. However, there are exceptions which can allow employers to take on unpaid interns depending on how they classify their interns employment status. See for example:

* Employment rights and pay for interns [gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns](https://www.gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns)
* Targetjobs position on [the law on unpaid internships: know your rights ](https://targetjobs.co.uk/internships/advice/275017-the-law-on-unpaid-internships-know-your-rights)
* This article on [Why I Regret Doing an Unpaid Internship](https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/blog/why-i-regret-doing-an-unpaid-internship/) [@louiseregret]
* For more horror stories see [google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships](https://www.google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships)

In science, technology and engineering, unpaid internships are much less common than in other sectors as demand for skilled scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians ([STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)) is generally high. Some employers, particularly startups, may offer company [equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)) (such as shares) as an alternative to a salary - again you should be wary of this. Unless you're very lucky, the chances are those shares will probably be worthless. Although many startups aspire to become [Unicorns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)), very few do. Like many people, I don't endorse unpaid internships, and I recommend you avoid them completely, see section \@ref(by-salary) and figure \@ref(fig:slavery-fig).

```{r slavery-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionslavery)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/slavery.jpeg")

(ref:captionslavery) Unpaid internships have been likened to [modern slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_slavery). You are vulnerable to exploitation when taking unpaid work. [@slavery;@unpaid] CC [BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en) image of footcuffs by the Collectie Stichting Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/6XaW](https://w.wiki/6XaW) adapted using the [Wikipedia App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

An unpaid internship might *claim* to be giving you:

* some ‚Äúexperience‚Äù or ‚Äúexposure‚Äù
* equity-for-work
* something impressive for your CV
* opportunities to ‚Äúbuild up your portfolio‚Äù
* improved access to paid employment at some vague (but unspecified) point the future

Unfortunately, in the worst case, taking an unpaid internship leaves you vulnerable to exploitation by ruthless employers looking for cheap or free labour. There are campaigns to ban them. [@BanUnpaidInternships] Unpaid internships have been likened to modern slavery, see figure \@ref(fig:slavery-fig), so I recommend you avoid them. üò≠

There is *one* exception to this: expenses paid work-shadowing for a short period of time (two or three weeks) such as spring insights described in section \@ref(areuexperienced). Otherwise, if you can't find paid employment, doing voluntary work for a charity or non-profit is a much safer bet and has mental health and social benefits too, see section \@ref(areuexperienced).

### Beware of overselling {#oversell}
When people try to sell you something, you will naturally be wary of overselling and fake news, see figure \@ref(fig:fakenews-fig).

```{r fakenews-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfakenews)"}

```
(ref:captionfakenews) Beware of false or misleading information in the jobs marketplace. Pool tables and free snacks are nice but are what is it *actually* like to work for a given employer? Are employers *really* as good as they say they are? Are *you* as good as you say you are? Or is it [fake news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news)? Overselling sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)

There's two kinds of fake news that are common in the jobs marketplace:

1. **Employers overselling themselves**: Recruitment can be a bit of a beauty contest, with employers trying to show you their best side. Some employers may make promises they can't deliver but a quick look on services like [glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com) will help you evaluate employers. Even better, talk directly with actual employees of the organisation, both current and former. Is their employer really as good as they say they are?
1. **Candidates exaggerating their achievements**: It can be tempting to oversell yourself in the marketplace. An experienced reader or interviewer will be able to spot your fake news and find you out, see chapter \@ref(debugging) *debugging your future*

So beware of fake news, overselling and other bullshit, see section \@ref(bullshit). [Don't believe the hype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Believe_the_Hype). [@dontbelievethehype] üìà

### Beware of underselling {#undersell}
Likewise, you should make sure you don't undersell yourself. Know your value (financial), know your values (see chapter \@ref(exploring)) and try to understand how that fits with a given employer. What are the employers stated values? When it comes to financial value, it is easy to find out about salaries, for example see:


* [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) (‚Äú*Get Paid, Not Played!*‚Äù) will give you a good idea of salaries
* [glassdoor.co.uk](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/) has salary information alongside employee reviews of their employers
* [technical intern salaries in the UK](https://github.com/IgWod/interns-salaries-uk-2018) [@igwod]
* [graduate salaries in the UK](https://luminate.prospects.ac.uk/graduate-salaries-in-the-uk) [@michaelgrove]
* [The Highest Paid Internships and Placements in the UK](https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/blog/highest-paid-internships-placements-uk/) [@louiseintern]

Salaries in the UK for interns (and graduates) range from [minimum wage](https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage) to ¬£50k and over, with everything in between. So beware of under-selling yourself, know your value, see \@ref(by-salary). Some employers see students as a form of cheap labour that can be exploited because you're not ‚Äúqualified‚Äù until you graduate. I'd think twice before working for such an employer, computing skills are in demand and there are plenty of other employers who will treat you with more respect. üìâ

Knowing your value is crucial if you're going to negotiate any job offers you receive, see section \@ref(offer).

### Beware of compromises {#compromises}
Engineering usually involves compromises and trade-offs, see figure \@ref(fig:furber-fig). You will have to make some compromises in *engineering your future*. This might be in the design and implementation of your career, such as your salary, location, employer, values or something else.

```{r furber-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfurber)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/steve-furber.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionfurber) The design of a [general-purpose processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_general-purpose_CPUs), in common with most engineering endeavours, requires careful consideration of many trade-offs and compromises. [@furberarm] That's also true for your engineering your future too, what compromises and trade-offs are you happy to make?

To work out what compromises and trade-offs you are prepared to make, you may need to revisit the issues discussed in chapter \@ref(exploring). ü§î

### Beware of the job scammers {#scams}
Most job adverts are legitimate but you are vulnerable when you are job hunting. You may become more vulnerable over time if you are getting repeated rejections (remember: repeated rejection is quite normal). Unfortunately there are some shady characters out there looking to exploit your vulnerability through various kinds of [employment fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_fraud). [@jobscammers; @scamjobs] You should be wary of anyone asking you for:

* Money up front - be very suspicious
* Excessive personal data such your birth date, passport number and bank details. These could be used for identity theft, fraud or other criminal activities
* Suspicious contact details and generic non-work free email addresses, e.g. gmail, outlook.com etc [@jobscammers2]
* See more examples in figure \@ref(fig:jobscams-fig) and at [google.com/search?q=job+scams](https://www.google.com/search?q=job+scams)

```{r jobscams-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionjobscams)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Job-Scams-Signs-GOVUK.png")
```
(ref:captionjobscams) Beware of the job scammers. You should be highly suspicious of illegitimate companies, poorly-written job adverts, dodgy contact details and emails, unrealistic salaries, job offers without an interview and being asked for money up front. Spotting the signs of job scammers by gov.uk is licensed under [Open Government Licence v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) [@jobscammers2]

Any job that seems a bit *too* good to be true *earn more money working from home!*, is likely to be a scam. [@scamjobs] Reputable employers (and jobs boards) will not try to scam you, but you should beware of job scammers if you find yourself looking for employment off the beaten track. Like [Pinocchio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocchio), its quite easy to spot lies once you recognise some of their nosey signals. ü§•

### Beware of the job spammers {#spamming}
You'll hopefully be able to spot (and avoid) the job scamming but its harder to avoid the job spamming. It isn't particularly difficult to find lots of job adverts and by the time you've registered with a few different systems described in section \@ref(looking), you'll find your inbox full of email, your notifications relentessly pinging and your LinkedIn feed full of vacancies. Recruiters will start ‚Äúreaching out‚Äù to you about roles you're not even remotely interested in. Welcome to [jobspam](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jobspam), see figure \@ref(fig:jobspam-fig).

```{r jobspam-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionjobspam)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/spam.jpeg")
```

(ref:captionjobspam) Spam, spam, spam, spam‚Ä¶ lovely spam! Wonderful spam! Job adverts are just another form of advertising, so when you're looking for a job, beware of the [jobspam](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jobspam). [Spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming) is named after a [*Monty Python* sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(Monty_Python_sketch)) where customers are relentlessly offered spam they aren't interested in. [@pythonspam] Jobspam is the same but for job adverts.

So beware of the jobspam, jobspam, jobspam, jobspam, jobspam‚Ä¶ lovely jobspam! Wonderful jobspam! üê∑ [@pythonspam]


### Beware of rejection {#rejection}
For most people, rejection is a normal part of applying for jobs. Rejection can take a heavy toll on your mental health described in chapter \@ref(nurturing) and it is often a struggle. Some employers won't even bother to reply to reject you, see Amish's story in chapter \@ref(amish) for example. Welcome to the employer **black hole** described in section \@ref(blackhole) and shown in figure \@ref(fig:blackhole-fig).

```{r blackhole-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionblackhole)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Black-hole-CV.png")
```

(ref:captionblackhole) Rejection is a normal part of applying for jobs, some of your applications may disappear without trace into the employer ‚Äú[black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole)‚Äù described in section \@ref(blackhole). Larger employers with a strong gravitational force on candidates like you are likely to behave like [supermassive black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole) for job applications. This *doesn't* mean you shouldn't bother applying, but that you need to think about how to make your application stand out and avoid taking it personally if/when  you don't hear back. CV black hole sketch by [Visual Thinkery](https://visualthinkery.com/) is licensed under [CC-BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/), based on an original image of the supermassive black hole in [Messier 87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87) created using the [CHIRP algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIRP_(algorithm)) by the [Event Horizon Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Horizon_Telescope) team via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3RCa](https://w.wiki/3RCa)

If you're getting too many rejections or all your applications are sucked into black holes, it might be because you need to :

* debug your CV and job applications some more (see chapter \@ref(debugging))
* develop a better job search strategy (see this chapter, chapter \@ref(finding))
* broaden your job search (see chapter \@ref(choosing))
* pay attention to your mental health, rejections can make you anxious and depressed (see chapter \@ref(nurturing))

So beware of rejection, try not to take it personally. Beware of rejection, it is (unfortumately) a normal part of job hunting. ü§Æ

### Beware of the rollercoaster {#rollercoaster}
There are highs and lows in job hunting, you will ride the job search rollercoaster shown in figure \@ref(fig:rollercoaster-fig). There will be highs, you'll be invited to interviews, but there will be also be lows too, such as the inevitable rejections we discussed in the previous section \@ref(rejection). It will be a rollercoaster, which ends on the high of a job offer you accept. Fasten your seatbelt, enjoy the ride and good luck with your applications and interviews! May the road rise with you! [@rise]

Your future is bright, your future needs finding. Finding your future will help you to test your future. Testing your future will help you to start coding your future.

* We've discussed some of the problems with recruitment, both for employers and prospective employees like you. Knowing about these limitations will help you navigate them during your job search
* We've looked at job search techniques that will help you find opportunities you care about. Figuring out what you want to do is tricky at times but it usually works out well in the end.
* Before applying the search criteria, making successful applications to get that interview offer, there's more search techniques we need to look at. In the next part, chapter \@ref(moving): *Moving your future*, we'll look at three of most important search criteria of all: location, location, location.

This chapter is under construction because I'm using agile book development methods, see figure \@ref(fig:deathstar5-fig).

It is no secret that, when applying for placements and graduate jobs, you are likely to submit multiple applications before being offered a role. In response to rejections, students are often encouraged to ‚Äòbe resilient‚Äô and ‚Äòkeep trying‚Äô ‚Äì but there‚Äôs a lot more to it than that.

While it‚Äôs important to bounce back from rejection and keep applying to opportunities, churning out one application after another in the name of resilience isn‚Äôt always productive. It is more important that you are taking steps to minimise rejection and increase your chances of success. And there are several ways that you can do this.

Don‚Äôt take a scattergun approach

You are more likely to be successful sending out five targeted, tailored applications than twenty untailored applications for roles you do not meet all the requirements for. So, my first piece of advice is to create targeted applications for opportunities you have a reasonable chance of getting (i.e. you meet all the necessary criteria).

You‚Äôll need to tailor each application to the employer and the role, detailing why you are interested in the opportunity and giving examples of what makes you the best person for the job. This will ensure that the applications you do send out are of a high quality.

Learn from feedback

If you‚Äôre unsuccessful at interview, make use of any feedback to identify areas for improvement. It‚Äôs important that you are self-critical and that you don‚Äôt take rejection personally. Acknowledge what you did well and improve on what you could have done better, so that your next application has a greater chance of success.

Create a schedule

Set yourself a reasonable target for the number of applications you are going to submit each week. It‚Äôs important that this target is realistic for you, so be sure to factor in your other responsibilities and priorities.

Designating a specific time to work on your applications should help you stay focused and motivated. It‚Äôs also likely to safeguard against burnout; in other words, it‚Äôll stop you from overworking yourself, which doesn‚Äôt usually do much for the quality of your work.

Moreover, working to a schedule means you‚Äôll have ongoing applications at different stages. If you receive a rejection from one application, you‚Äôre likely to have others in progress, which should help you stay motivated and remain optimistic.

Keep an open mind

Try to think laterally when choosing which opportunities to apply for. It can be tempting to apply to companies which you are already familiar with, and while there are lots of advantages of working for large, well-known organisations, there are just as many benefits to working for medium-sized companies and SMEs that you perhaps might not have heard of.

By considering the full range of companies on Gradcracker, you open yourself up to more opportunities, and more chances of success.

Equally, don‚Äôt just go for the opportunities that are directly related to your degree discipline. As a STEM student, your transferable skills make you highly sought after in a diverse range of sectors and roles, so try to keep an open mind when searching for opportunities.

Now, it‚Äôs time to try again!
I hope these steps help you to bounce back from rejection ‚Äì but also to prevent rejection and increase your chances of success.-->
