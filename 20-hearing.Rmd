# Hearing your future {#hearing}

*Hearing your Future* is the Coding your Future podcast which accompanies this guidebook. We talk to the [graduands](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/graduand) and graduates of computer science shown in figure \@ref(fig:collage-fig), to hear more about their journey from student to professional. What happens after graduation like the one shown in figure \@ref(fig:graduation-fig)? What comes next?

## From student to professional {#pro}

Listen in to the episodes below, or read the transcripts, to find out more about how these students are coding their future:

* What's their story?  
* How did they get to where they are?
* What obstacles have they faced and how did they overcome them?
* What advice would they offer to their former selves and fellow students?
* Where are they planning to going next?

## Episode $x$: it could be YOU! {#you}
YOUR FUTURE WANTS YOU: Join your future! If you'd like to be interviewed for the show, [get in touch](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact), see figure \@ref(fig:yfnu-fig). Besides interviewing current graduates, I'm interested in speaking to former graduates, especially if you:

* completed a placement or internship(s) as an undergraduate or postgraduate
* consider yourself to be part of a minority or under-represented group

I'm also interested in speaking to people who graduated a while back, not just this years graduates, but any back to 1968. üéì [@babygrowsup]

```{r yfnu-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "33%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionyfnu)"}

(ref:captionyfnu) Your ~~country~~ future wants YOU. ü´µ Join your future. If you are a former student of Computer Science who'd like to appear on the show, [get in touch](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact). I'm especially interested to hear from students who did internships or placements before they graduated in Computer Science.

If you're coming on the show, please have a think about the following questions which we ask all our guests:

1. üé∏ What's your story, coding glory see section \@ref(your-story)
1. ‚úäüèΩ Minority report (optional) see section \@ref(minority)
1. üëë You are the next Vice Chancellor (optional) see section \@ref(vc)
1. üçø One tune, one podcast, one book, one film: see section \@ref(otopof)
1. ‚è± Time traveller, see section \@ref(your-time)


### What's your story, coding glory? {#your-story}

> What's your story, coding glory?‚Äù

What's your [origin story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story), see figure \@ref(fig:gallagher2-fig)? 

* What's your name and where do you come from? [@blinddate]
* Why did you choose to study computer science?
* Which organisation were you employed by, why and how did you choose them
* What were the main obstacles you faced finding employment and how did you overcome them?
* Tell us about your roles and responsibilities within the organisation
* How did you find the job and what other jobs did they look for?
* What were the main things you learned on placement?
* What was the most enjoyable or rewarding part of working for your employer?
* What did you do for your final year project?
* If you graduated previously, what has been your career path to date?

### Minority report {#minority}
This is an optional question taken from the title of the [Philip K. Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick) novel *[The Minority Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minority_Report)* and subsequent film adaptation, see figure \@ref(fig:minority-fig). Minority report asks our guests:

* Do you consider yourself to be a member of an under-represented, minority or otherwise marginalised group?
* If so which one(s) are you happy to discuss, see section \@ref(protected)?
* What has your experience been of being in a minority at University and in the workplace?
* How can the teaching and learning of computer science be made more [equitable, diverse and inclusive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion) for members of your minority group(s)?
* What else can universities do to make campuses more welcoming to members of your minority group(s)?
* What more can employers do to make workplaces more welcoming to members of your minority group(s)?

```{r minority-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionminority)"}

(ref:captionminority) Are you in a minority?  Inspired by the book [@theminorityreport] and its film adaptation [@minorityreport], we'll hear from some of our minorities. *The Minority Report* is short story by Philip K. Dick first published by *[Fantastic Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Universe)* magazine in 1956. What is it like being in minority and how could universities and employers be more welcoming to your minority group(s)?

If you're in a minority that you're happy to talk about, do you have anything you'd like to report? ‚úäüèΩ

### You are the next Vice Chancellor {#vc}
Congratulations, the [board of governors](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/governance/structure/board-governors/) and [senate of the University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/governance/structure/senate/) have just appointed you their next leader where you'll take over from the current Vice Chancellor (VC) [Nancy Rothwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Rothwell), shown in figure \@ref(fig:vc-fig). Nancy has served as VC since 2010, and will step down in 2024, the [200th anniversary](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/history-heritage/history/umist/) of the foundation of the University of Manchester. [@umist] As VC, you now have responsibility for 11,000 staff, 40,000 students and access to a global network of over 500,000 alumni. You'll also take over as chair of the [russellgroup.ac.uk](https://russellgroup.ac.uk/). Since this is an optional question, you can dodge this bullet if you'd rather not attempt to answer it.

(ref:captionvc) Professor [Nancy Rothwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Rothwell) is Vice Chancellor (VC) of the University of Manchester. If *you* were VC, what would you change about how the University is run?

Now that you are the VC, what would you change about the University of Manchester to improve the [teaching and learning](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/teaching-learning/)? What would be your first task to make a difference to students like yourself? üëë

### One tune, one podcast, one book and one film {#otopof}

We love our books, music, films and podcasts. This love is expressed in gratuitous popular culture references throughout *Coding your Future*. Critics say the musical playlists in chapter \@ref(enjoying) are clogged up with:

* Lancashire boy bands, see section \@ref(lancashire)
* [BritPop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britpop) and Dad-Rock, see section \@ref(dadrock) [@dadrock]
* Cardigan-swinging, [shoe-gazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze), [Glastonbury-gigging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival), [indie music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock), see section \@ref(indie)
* Music made with digital computers rather than analogue instruments, see section \@ref(electronica)
* other antiquities from a bygone era, see figure \@ref(fig:dadrock-fig).

```{r dadrock-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "98%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiondadrock)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dad-rock.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiondadrock) From the Beatles to the Rolling Stones, U2 to Fleetwood Mac, Oasis to Guns N' Roses and Jimi  Hendrix to Queen: the [Dad-rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dad-rock) playlist shamelessly revels in classic but bygone glories of yesteryear.

So, can you recommend a:

* **TUNE!** One tune to rejuvenate or internationlise our playlists. Why is it important to you?
    - Perhaps it makes you relax, feel happy or comforted?
    - Maybe it reminds you of special people, a special time or special place in your life?
    - We'll add it to *The Coder's Playlist* in section \@ref(coders)
* **PODCAST:** One podcast  you‚Äôve enjoyed that you‚Äôd recommend people listen or subscribe to üéß
* **BOOK:** One book (or audiobook) you‚Äôve enjoyed, either fiction or non-fiction üìï
* **FILM:** One film we‚Äôve got to go and watch right now, old or new üçø

### Time traveller {#your-time}

Do you wish that you knew what you know now, when you were younger? Just like [Ronnie Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Lane), [Ronnie Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Wood) and [Rod Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Stewart), we all probably feel that way sometimes, see figure \@ref(fig:faces2-fig). So, if you could travel back in time to meet the younger you, just starting University:

* What would you tell your former self, now that you are older and wiser?
* What would you tell current students to help them get the most of their preciously short time at University?

```{r faces2-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfaces2)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/faces.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionfaces2) Poor old grandad I laughed at all his words but I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger, see [Ooh La La](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_La_La_(Faces_song)). [@faces] Do you wish that you knew what you know now, when you were younger? What would you tell your younger self about getting the most from University life?

What do you know now, that you wish you'd known when you were younger? ‚è±

## Everything I had to know, I heard it on my radio {#radio}
Let's leave the last words on podcasting to *[The Buggles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buggles)* and *[Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band))*.
