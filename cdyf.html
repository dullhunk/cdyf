Your future is bright, your future needs coding. Welcome to <em>Coding Your Future</em>: the guidebook that will help you to design, build, test and <code>code</code> your future in computing at <a href="https://www.cdyf.me"><code>www.cdyf.me</code></a>. Also available as a free ebook and pdf (see section @ref(downloading)), this guide is aimed at ALL students in higher education. While this guide supports undergraduate teaching and learning at the University of Manchester, it doesn’t actually matter:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>where</em> in the world you are studying</li>
<li>what <em>stage</em> of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year</li>
<li>what <em>level</em> you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate</li>
<li>what <em>institution</em> you are studying at, this book is institutionally agnostic</li>
<li>what <em>subject</em> you are studying, as long as you are <strong>computationally curious</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There is something in this guidebook for <em>any</em> student of computing, both those inside and outside of Computer Science departments. 👨🏿‍💻👨‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩‍💻👩🏿‍💻</p>

<p>A lot of careers advice can be dry, dull, textbooky, generic and boring with few illustrations and conversations. In the novel <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</a></em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wonderland">L. Carroll 1865</a>)</span> shown in figure @ref(fig:aiw-fig), the protagonist Alice wonders why her sister is reading a book without pictures.</p>

</div>
<p>(ref:captionalicecover) Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations? <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wonderland">L. Carroll 1865</a>)</span> Public domain image of the cover of the 1898 edition of the novel <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</a></em> via Wikimedia Commons <a href="https://w.wiki/3S4C">w.wiki/3S4C</a> adapted using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238">Wikipedia app</a></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> Your future aims</h2>
<p>This guidebook aims to help you develop stronger habits of mind, body and soul using five key ingredients: <strong><code>C</code></strong>, <strong><code>D</code></strong>, <strong><code>Y</code></strong>, <strong><code>F</code></strong> and <strong><code>.me</code></strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><code>C is for CODE</code></strong>: Instructions, algorithms, recipes, methods and strategies contained in this guidebook. This <code>code</code> is for your consumption, not for a machine.</li>
<li><strong><code>D is for DATA</code></strong>: From big data to microdata, from your data to my data and our data. From structured data, to semi-structured data and un-structured data. To factual, statistical, graphical, to readable and audible data. Bytes, bits and bobs collected together for your analysis and amusement</li>
<li><strong><code>Y is for YOU</code></strong>: This book is all about you, with activities and other <em>coding challenges</em> for you to do in addition to just passively reading</li>
<li><strong><code>F is for FUTURES</code></strong>: Possible futures for you to think about. Try not to dwell on the past. Think about the future. Think about <em>your</em> future. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thinkaboutthefuture">Ryder 1988</a>, <a href="#ref-wroteforluck">2019</a>)</span></li>
<li><strong><code>.me is for ME</code></strong>: Hello, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_(given_name)">my name is Duncan</a>, see figure @ref(fig:hello-my-name-fig). I’m your tour guide here. If you’re feeling a bit lost, follow me and together we can starting coding your future.</li>

<p><em>Coding your future</em> explores techniques for investigating career possibilities, job searching, making career decisions, writing applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace.</p>
<p>Alongside these practical engineering issues, this guidebook also encourages you to <em>design your future</em> by taking a step back and reflecting on the bigger picture. You will apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking">computational thinking</a> techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people about your experience, skills and knowledge. As there is a computational theme, you will also need to reflect on what your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output">inputs and outputs (I/O)</a> are, both now and in the future. You’ll also need to think about what recipes (or algorithms) you might start experimenting with</p>
<p>This guidebook investigates professional and pastoral issues in computing, for those with and without Computer Science degrees in the early stage of their careers.</p>
<!--We will also discuss some algorithms (recipes) that you might like to try-->
</div>
<div id="nilo" class="section level2" number="0.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.3</span> What you won’t learn</h2>
<p>This guidebook will NOT teach you how to write code, there’s already lots of fantastic resources to help you do that. We discuss some of them in chapter @ref(computing) on <em>computing your future</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="bilo" class="section level2" number="0.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.4</span> Learning your future</h2>
<p>So what <em>will</em> you learn from this guidebook? After reading this guidebook, watching the videos and doing the exercises you will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Improve your self-awareness by describing who you are, what motivates you and your strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li>Experiment with using some job search strategies and make adjustments to your algorithms as necessary</li>
<li>Identify employers, sectors and roles that are of interest to you<br />
</li>
<li>Improve your written communication skills both for job applications and communicating with other people</li>
<li>Plan and prepare competitive written applications using standard techniques including CVs, covering letters, application forms and digital profiles</li>
<li>Compete confidently and successfully in interviews. Anticipate and prepare for both technical and non-technical questions</li>
<li>Plan further possibilities in your career such as promotion, postgraduate study &amp; research, alternative employment and longer term goals</li>
<li>Search and navigate a large “wordbase” (this guidebook and the work it cites). A wordbase is like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebase"><code>codebase</code></a>, only written predominantly in natural language.</li>
</ol>
<!--codebase, documentbase, languagebase, wordbase-->
<div id="prereq" class="section level3" number="0.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.4.1</span> Your future requirements</h3>
<p>As the title of this guidebook implies, there is a computational flavour here, but you do not have to be studying Computer Science to benefit. There are two main target audiences for this guidebook:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of their degree. This includes software engineering, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction (HCI), information systems, health informatics, data science, gaming, cybersecurity and all the other myriad flavours of Computer Science</li>
<li>Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying <em>any</em> subject, with little or no Computer Science at all. You are curious to know about what role computing could play in your future career because computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists, see chapter @ref(computing) on <em>Computing your Future</em></li>
<li>Unless you are a mature student, you are most probably a member of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">Generation Z</a></li>
</ol>
<p>So the prerequisites for this book are that you are studying (or have studied) at a University where English is one of the main spoken languages. You <em>may</em> have some experience already, either casual, voluntary or otherwise, but this book does <strong>not</strong> assume that you have already been employed in some capacity.</p>
</div>
<div id="gut" class="section level3" number="0.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.4.2</span> Gutting your future</h3>
<p>Reading this book from cover to cover like a novel is not recommended. That would be foolish.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fish-gutting.jpeg" alt="(ref:captiongut)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:gut-fig)(ref:captiongut)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captiongut) Don’t <em>read</em> this book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disembowelment">disembowel it</a>! Eviscerate it! Gut it like a fish! Enjoy the nourishing flesh and discard the less appetising organs of its gastrointestinal tract. You’ll need to decide which is which, depending on your tastes and appetite. CC0 Public domain image of fish gutting by Wilfredor via Wikimedia commons <a href="https://w.wiki/_23m">w.wiki/_23m</a> adapted using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238">Wikipedia app</a></p>
<p>Instead of reading this book, I suggest you follow the advice given to historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodruff">William Woodruff</a> about reading books when he was at University:</p>
<blockquote>
“You don’t READ books, you GUT them!”
<footer>
— William Woodruff <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nabend">Woodruff 2003</a>)</span>
</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>So, gut this book like the fish in figure @ref(fig:gut-fig). Identify the chapters that are most useful to you (the flesh), and skip the rest (the guts). Which chapters are flesh and which are guts will depend on what stage of the journey you are at. This guidebook is designed to be as “guttable” as possible. To aid gutting, the version published at <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/">cdyf.me</a> has a built in search and tables of contents. Before you can gut the fish, you’ll need an anatomical map shown in figure @ref(fig:map-fig).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.5</span> Mapping your future</h2>
<!-- or should it be structuring-->
<p>Your future is split into five parts, each of which has several chapters:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Chapters @ref(rebooting) to @ref(computing) investigate <strong>DESIGNING</strong> your future</li>
<li>Chapters @ref(debugging) to @ref(speaking) investigate <strong>TESTING</strong> your future</li>
<li>Chapters @ref(organising) to @ref(enjoying) investigate <strong>BUILDING</strong> your future</li>
<li>Chapters @ref(starting) to @ref(ruling) investigate <strong>DEPLOYING</strong> your future</li>
<li>Chapters @ref(hearing) to @ref(reading) investigate <strong>CODING</strong> your future, by meeting students who are doing just that followed by the final chapter on <em>Reading your Future</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Although <em>presented</em> in a linear order, follow whatever path suits you best, as shown on the right hand side of figure @ref(fig:map-fig). Many students start with chapter @ref(debugging), but individual entry and exit points to your future will differ.</p>

</div>
<p>(ref:captionmapping) A map to your future: traditional learning often adopts a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall model</a> by following a predictable <em>linear</em> path, as shown in the left hand side of this picture. You go to some lectures, do some coursework then sit an exam. All very linear and sequential. In contrast, whatever path you take in life, your future is unlikely to be either predictable <em>or</em> linear. Consequently, this guidebook encourages you to follow a <em>non-linear</em> iterative learning journey, shown on the right hand side. Start with whatever chapter you like, follow your nose and be prepared to revisit chapters as you progress through the early moves in your career. CC BY-SA map of your future by Yours Truly.</p>
<p>Let’s look in a bit more detail at each of the five parts of your future, starting with designing your future.</p>
<div id="parti" class="section level3" number="0.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.5.1</span> Designing your future</h3>
<p>The first six chapters of this guidebook look at what engineers call <em>design</em>. When you build anything, a bridge, a piece of software, a car or a plane you’ll need to do some design like the blueprint in figure @ref(fig:brooklyn-fig)</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/brooklyn-bridge-blueprint.png" alt="(ref:captionblueprint)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:brooklyn-fig)(ref:captionblueprint)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionblueprint) Designing your future is about drawing up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint">blueprint</a>, like this one for the elevation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a> in New York. What does your blueprint look like? Chapter’s @ref(rebooting) through to @ref(computing) will help you design your future.</p>
<p>Building a career isn’t that different to building anything else, you’ll need do many iterations of designing, coding, testing, building and deploying. Designing things often involves answering tricky questions. So when you’re designing your future you’ll need to cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter @ref(rebooting): <em>Rebooting your future</em> discusses why you should bother reading this guidebook and coding your future</li>
<li>Chapter @ref(exploring): <em>Exploring your future</em> challenges you to reflect on who you are, what makes you unique and what you have to offer to build better self-awareness</li>
<li>Chapter @ref(nurturing): <em>Nurturing your future</em> encourages you to pay attention to your mental and physical health</li>
<li>Chapter @ref(writing): <em>Writing your future</em> explores your softer communication skills, how they complement your hard skills and why employers value them so much</li>
<li>Chapter @ref(experiencing): <em>Experiencing your future</em> asks you to reflect on your experience and help identify where you can improve it</li>
<li>Chapter @ref(choosing): <em>Choosing your future</em> encourages you to broaden your computational horizons. What possibile routes can you choose from, beyond the obvious well-trodden paths?</li>
<li>Chapter @ref(computing): <em>Computing your future</em> looks at the role computing can play in your career, especially if Computer Science is not a major part of your degree</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="part" class="section level3" number="0.5.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.5.2</span> Testing your future</h3>
<p>The next six chapters look at testing your future, by taking a test-driven approach to career development. What tests do you need to prepare for and pass before you can starting building your future? Just like building high quality software requires that you pass tests, so too, building a career means passing a series of tests. Each of these tests have inputs, an algorithm and outputs:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.5.3</span> Building your future</h3>
<p>The next seven chapters look at building your future. You’ve passed all the tests, what do do you need to do to keep building your future in the same way as you would build a bridge, like the one shown in figure @ref(fig:manhattan-fig).</p>

<p>(ref:captionbridge) Just like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Bridge">Manhattan Bridge</a>, your future will be easier to build once you’ve done some preliminary design. You don’t need a grand design with tonnes of details, a simple sketch will do. Design questions are covered in the first part of this guidebook on designing your future.

<p>Once you’ve started to answer the design questions in the first part, you can start to implement it, by testing and building your career:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter @ref(organising): <em>Organising your future</em> investigates how to schedule and organise the activities in this guidebook</li>
<li>Chapter @ref(researching): <em>Researching your future</em> investigates if a Masters degree or a PhD right for you?</li>
<li>Chapter @ref(enjoying): <em>Enjoying your future</em> is a musical interlude, providing a soundtrack that might help with your wellbeing</li>

<li>Too many citations? Not enough citations? Missed any key citations?</li>

<p>This acknowledgements section is really looooooong because I try to practice what I preach about the importance of expressing gratitude, see section @ref(lays). It also serves as a live demonstration of a (public) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal">gratitude journal</a>. Expressing gratitude, publicly and privately, is a simple and proven technique for improving your mental health. It will also improve the mental health of the people who you thank, and strengthen the communities that you are part of, see @ref(signposts3).</p>

I have had some spectacular failures, alongside some modest successes, and have included personal stories where they are relevant.</p>
<p>Most of what I have learned about employment comes from listening to, watching and helping students as they interact with employers on the first tentative moves in their careers, particularly through our industrial experience program, see figure @ref(fig:ie-fig).</p>

<p>(ref:ieblurb) Number of undergraduate students completing a year in industry as part of their degrees in Computer Science at the University of Manchester. Since 2008 over 900 students have completed the program that I have been leading since 2012. We’ve managed to double the number of students doing placements per year. As you can see in the histogram, the COVID-19 pandemic started having an effect on students starting placements in 2020.</p>
<p>I’ve documented some of what our students have taught me, so reading this book may help you learn from some of their successes and failures.</p>

<p>The first part of this book is about <em>designing</em> your future. Before we get started, we need to reboot and tackle a fundamental design issue. Why the hell would you want to bother reading this guidebook when you have so many other things to do right now?</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ You are a busy person, <em>YES</em>!</li>
<li>✅ Your time is a precious and finite resource, <em>YES</em>!</li>
<li>✅ You could be spending that precious time right now in lots of other ways, <em>YES</em>!</li>
<li>✅ There are mountains of self-help guides and courses already, <em>YES</em>!</li>
<li>✅ Do you really need <em>yet another</em> guidebook? <em>YES! YES! YES</em>!</li>
</ul>
<p>You should read this guidebook because it is different to all the other guidebooks! It will help you design, test, build, debug and <code>code</code> your future in computing.</p>
<p>Before you start either designing or coding, we need to reboot. So come with me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_the_rabbit_hole">down the proverbial rabbit hole</a> in figure @ref(fig:rabbit-fig) and let me explain… 🐇</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Maximising your future</h2>
<p>As well as opening your future, studying at University is about <em>investing</em> in your future. You’re spending lots of your time and money at University. Hopefully, you’ve picked a subject that stimulates and challenges you intellectually while allowing you to find and develop your unique talents. But there’s another reason that you probably chose to study at University and that was to improve your job prospects. This guidebook will:</p>

<li>Give you an overview of important professional issues that are sometimes neglected or sidelined in school and University curricula</li>
<li>Highlight and review essential resources beyond this guidebook that will help with the above</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the resources that can help you are scattered around in lots of different places. There are books, there are videos, there are podcasts, there are websites and jobs boards. There are online courses, blogs, social media, newspaper columns, journal articles, marketing material and many other good resources. It is overwhelming.</p>

<p>When Andy Stanford-Clark started working at IBM as a graduate fresh out of University, his manager gave him the career advice shown in figure @ref(fig:andysc-fig):</p>

<p>Andy is now Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of IBM in the UK and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Master_Inventor">IBM Master inventor</a>, so it was probably good advice. There are plenty people who can help design and build your future, ultimately it is <strong>YOU</strong> who has to take responsibility for the implementation (if you like, the <code>code</code>). The sooner you get coding the better.</p>
<p>At University, there are lots of people can help design and build your future: peers, friends, academic staff, your careers service, employers and your wider social and professional networks but ultimately it is <em>your</em> responsibility to sort out whatever comes next. That might sound obvious but don’t wait to get started later or for somebody else to do it for you, because it probably won’t happen.</p>

<p>You have worked hard to get the grades you needed to get into University. You’ve spent (or are spending) a significant amount of time and money studying your chosen discipline. You are really <em>geeking out</em> by going deep into your subject for a substantial period of time. Geekery, by which I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek">being interested in a subject for its own sake</a>, is a <em>good</em> thing. Earning the title <em>geek</em> is a compliment, not an insult, and you should wear your geek badge with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Pride_Day">geek pride</a>! Some people even say:</p>

<p>At some point during or after your study, you might find yourself applying for a graduate job or graduate scheme. EVERYONE applying for these opportunities will have a degree or be rapidly on their way to getting one. So having a degree, even a really geeky one, isn’t going to set you apart much from your competition. Even having a first class degree may not distinguish you that much your competitors <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gradeinflation">Coughlan 2019a</a>; <a href="#ref-firstclass">Borrett 2019</a>)</span>.

<!--Reducing the Stress of Perfectionism
Perfectionism has a way of robbing us of that glow of achievement and ultimately making us miserable. Having high standards is good but not if they make everything in life so challenging that we are exhausted before we have even started!

If you find that you are never really satisfied with your achievements, spend a lot of time procrastinating rather than working and are increasingly self-critical, then this could be the workshop for you. You will learn:

* About the psychology of the perfectionist
* how perfectionism becomes self-defeating.
* ways of challenging the rigid perfectionist mindset

Image from an <a href="https://twitter.com/UniversitiesUK/status/1513439211059306497">orginal tweet</a> quoting a report by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_UK">Universities UK</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ballmyths">Ball 2022</a>)</span></p>
<p>What the data in figure @ref(fig:lotsofgrads-fig) show is that you’ll need to look <strong>beyond</strong> your formal education to distinguish yourself from your competition. Your degree can certainly help you start a career, and computer geekery is a commercially valuable skill but a degree (however geeky) is typically not enough by itself.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of graduate jobs for you to apply for, but that doesn’t mean its going to be easy to walk into one when you graduate. Employers are looking for more from their employees than just <em>having</em> a degree, see chapter @ref(experiencing).</p>

<p>You might be tempted to postpone making difficult career decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll do it tomorrow …</li>
<li>I’ll do it next week …</li>
<li>I’ll do it next year …</li>

<p>Procrastination is a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition">human condition</a> and its not necessarily a bad thing. Software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)">Paul Graham</a> and journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Burkeman">Oliver Burkeman</a> describe three types of procrastination:</p>

<p>(ref:captionprocrastination) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination">Procrastination</a>: the attitude of “I’ll get my degree out of the way first then worry about jobs and careers when I finish University” is bad procrastination. It’s too late when you graduate to start thinking about what might come next <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-procrastination">Graham 2005a</a>)</span> Stressed procrastinator picture by MismibaTinasheMadando on Wikimedia Commons <a href="https://w.wiki/3TXo">w.wiki/3TXo</a></p>
<p>Postponing decisions about your future is usually bad procrastination, because you risk neglecting the wrong things. You are relying on doing all your (career) testing at the end, when you graduate. You are procrastinating the <code>testing</code> stage of your career development, when its often better to test early and test often, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ “test-last (career) development” where you get experience at the end, <em>after</em> you graduate</li>
<li>✅ “test-driven (career) development” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>) where you get experience <em>before</em> you graduate</li>
</ul>
<p>It probably doesn’t help that many of the issues described and discussed in this book are typically not closely integrated into the curriculum in Higher Education. You’ll often find them on the edges, or completely outside of, standard University curricula.</p>
<!--Broadly speaking, the professional issues described in this book are usually covered by

* pastoral support systems
* counselling services
* careers services
* trade organisations
* professional bodies
* student unions and their societies.-->
<p>Despite being sidelined, these issues matter and it is in your own self interests to start thinking about them right now. According to recent estimates by <em>Investors in People</em>, the average person spends <strong>80,000 hours</strong> working during their lifetime. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-iip2">Investor 2020</a>)</span> So, <em>whatever</em> you end up doing after University, you’ll be spending a lot of time doing it. Difficult decisions often get sidelined but it is never too early to <em>experiencing your future</em>, see chapter @ref(experiencing).</p>
<p>If you want to work for a big name like those in section @ref(bignames) or @ref(studentjobs), many of the larger graduate employers expect you to have <em>some</em> experience (see chapter @ref(experiencing)) <em>before</em> you graduate. A large chunk of vacancies on graduate schemes are filled with people who have already been employed as interns or placement students within that (or another) organisation. So the sooner you start investigating employers by getting some experience the better decisions you’ll be able to make about what comes next. It’s (usually) too late when you graduate.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean you have to know EXACTLY what you want to do when you finish. Lots of students don’t and I certainly didn’t when I graduated. I’d done a gap year teaching in India, two summer internships (in Sweden and the United States) and a year-in-industry in the UK and I <em>still</em> graduated with <strong>no clue</strong> as to what I wanted to do next! The important thing is that you make a start by getting some experience, paid or otherwise, see chapter @ref(experiencing). Sometimes knowing what you <strong>don’t</strong> want to do is just as valuable as knowing what you <em>DO</em> want to do. Either way, your future starts now, see figure @ref(fig:future-now-fig).</p>

<p>(ref:captionfuturenow) Your Future starts now, not at some point later in time like when you graduate.

Experience will make it easier to navigate your future. <em>THE FUTURE IS NOW</em> by Everydayphrase <a href="https://linktr.ee/everydayphrase">linktr.ee/everydayphrase</a></p>
<p>Computer scientists call this problem “search space reduction” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-searchspace">Ferrari, Marin-Jimenez, and Zisserman 2008</a>)</span>. You have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region">feasible region</a> of future possibilities and you need to narrow down the candidates.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Yes, this WILL be on the exam</h2>
<p>Students love to ask their teachers “<em>will this be on the exam</em>”? The short answer is <strong>YES</strong> (and <strong>NO</strong>)! Yes, this will be on the exam, but NO the exam won’t be set by your University. Unlike other courses you’ve done, the examinations for this course aren’t set by your University but by employers. Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of examinations that you’ll need to get good at, shown in Table @ref(tab:examtable)</p>

<p>So, <em>yes</em>, this will be on the exam, but <em>no</em>, the exams are obviously not set, administered, invigilated and marked by academics at your University. The exams are set by employers and the results are <strong>brutally binary</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PASS</strong>: you’ve got the interview, job or promotion or…</li>
<li><strong>FAIL</strong>: none of the above. Next!</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the challenging things about employers exams are, they typically do not have the bandwidth to give applicants useful feedback, other than a simple pass or fail. When it comes to job applications software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell">Gayle Laakmann McDowell</a> calls this the “black hole”. The gravitational force of employers black holes is so strong that no CV or Résumé can escape, we’ll say more about this in chapter @ref(debugging) on debugging your future.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.12.3</span> Your future is guided</h3>
<p>This guidebook to your future accompanies a course that has been co-designed by students for students, with input from academics and employers. It unites several disparate themes into one coherent story, from fundamental questions about identity and wellbeing through to more applied and practical advice on job hunting, career progression and life after University. Resources that do this are typically scattered around in many different places. There is usually no narrative to tie them all together to help students navigate the mountains of advice as they embark on the first stages of their careers.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.12.5</span> Your future is personal, emotional and sociable</h3>
<p>A lot of scientific and technical writing is written in the third person or passive voice. It can be cold and impersonal which is fine for academic writing, but can alienate readers. I have opted to use first person narrative where possible as it is shorter, and hopefully more engaging for you to read. Where relevant, I’ve told people’s stories, to illustrate key social points. There’s plenty of emotion here too, because job searching can be an emotional rollercoaster: from anxiety, joy, depression, frustration, hope, anger and englightenment - it’s all here. Learning is a highly emotional process, especially at University where you may also be living away from friends and family for the first time. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-quinlanfeels">Quinlan 2016</a>)</span></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.14</span> Signposting your future</h2>
<p>Each chapter in this book has a signposts section, highlighting key reading, watching or listening you could do next. This chapter has addressed the question of <strong>why should you bother coding your future</strong>? The answer is that your future is your responsibility and no-one elses. There are lots of people can help shape your future, but none more than yourself. Software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin">Robert C. Martin</a> argues this point in his book <em>The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</em>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cleancoder">Martin 2011</a>)</span></p>
<p>What’s good about <em>The Clean Coder</em> is that it is short (only 200 pages), well written and to the point. The main part of the book covers professional issues in software engineering, some of which I discuss further in chapter @ref(starting), <em>starting your future</em>.</p>

<p>Your future is bright, your future needs rebooting. Rebooting your future will help you design your future. Designing your future will help you to start coding your future.</p>
<p>The TL;DR for this chapter is, you should read this guidebook because it is different to all the other guidebooks. It will help you take responsibility for maximising your future. No-one else is going to do this for you. Your degree will help open up future options, but it is not enough by itself so you’ll need to maximise the return on your investment. Don’t procrastinate because it’s too late when you graduate and <em>YES</em> this will be on the exam (set by future employers). This guidebook has signposts to help you navigate, design, build, test, debug and code your future in computing.</p>
<p>It looks like the reboot has finished, so we’re ready to go. Welcome to your future. In the next part, you will reflect on who you are and what your story is in chapter @ref(exploring): <em>Exploring your Future</em>.</p>

<!-- Your education is a big part of your identity so being conscious of how your education has already changed you is an important step in developing self-awareness. Identifying what your formal education *can't* do for you, is just as crucial too.

Some parts of your identity are so important that they are protected by legislation, in the UK and in other countries. -->

<div id="protected" class="section level3" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Your protected characteristics</h3>
<p>Some of your identity includes characteristics that are protected. In the UK, the Equality Act of 2010<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> protects you from discrimination at work or in education, based on what are known as “protected characteristics”. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-equality">Servant 2020a</a>)</span>. This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>age</strong> should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>disabilities</strong> should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>gender</strong> should not determine how you are treated <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-inferior">Saini 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-damore">Damore 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-damoreguardian">Lewis 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-everydaysexism">Bates 2016</a>)</span></li>
<li>Your <strong>gender re-assignment</strong> should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>marriage</strong> or civil partnership should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>pregnancy</strong> and maternity should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>race</strong> (including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin) should not determine how you are treated <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nottalking">Eddo-Lodge 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-superior">Saini 2019</a>)</span></li>

<li>Your <strong>sex</strong> should not determine how you are treated <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-harassment">Price 2019</a>)</span></li>
<li>Your <strong>sexual orientation</strong> should not determine how you are treated <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nosex">B. Britton 2019</a>)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These are a special part of your identity because they are protected. This means they shouldn’t be a factor in apply for a job or a subject for discussion in a job interview. Let’s look at gender, sex and sexual orientation in more detail because they can be easily misunderstood. One way to understand gender better is to break it down into four characteristics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Identity</strong>: your gender identity</li>
<li><strong>Expression</strong>: your gender expression</li>
<li><strong>Sex</strong>: your biological sex</li>
<li><strong>Attraction</strong>: your sexual and romantic orientation</li>
</ol>
<p>These protected characteristics are often conflated, because people tend to confuse gender, sex and sexual orientation. They are <em>not</em> the same thing as shown in equation @ref(eq:gender)</p>
<div class="rmdnote">
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
Identity ≠ Expression ≠ Sex ≠ Attraction
  (\#eq:gender)
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Lets have a look at each of those in turn:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Identity</strong> 🧠 is who you know yourself to be in your own head. Gender identity is based on how much you align (or don’t align) with the options for gender based on your psychological sense of self. This includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li><code>Woman | Genderqueer | Man</code> see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Expression</strong> 🎨 is how you demonstrate your gender based on gender roles through the ways that you act, dress, behave and interact. These are not exclusive categories, you might choose to express yourself in all three ways including:
<ul>
<li><code>Feminine | Androgynous | Masculine</code> see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sex</strong> ⚧️ is often conflated with gender. Sometimes called anatomical sex or physical sex, your biological sex is objectively measurable using features such as your genitalia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome">chromosomes</a> (your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-determination_system">sex-determination system</a> <code>XX</code>, <code>XY</code> etc), hormones, body hair, ovaries and testes. Your biological sex includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li><code>Female | Intersex | Male</code> see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Attraction</strong> ❤️ is who you are physically, spiritually and emotionally attracted to. Like biological sex, sexual orientation is often conflated with gender but isn’t always a component of gender. We categorise the attraction we experience in gendered ways. Your sexual orientation includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li><code>Asexual | Heterosexual | Bisexual | Homosexual</code> see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These characteristics are summarised in the genderbread person shown in figure @ref(fig:genderbread-fig)</p>

<p>By starting to answer these (admittedly <strong>BIG!</strong>) questions you will gain a better understanding of who you are. This includes your strengths, weaknesses, motivation and values. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-parachute2020">Bolles 2019</a>)</span> Your story is complex but you need to know it so you can distil the details into <em>much</em> shorter stories on your job applications described in section @ref(mycvst). Crucial parts of your story are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Characters</strong>: <em>Who</em> are the key people who have influenced your story so far?</li>
<li><strong>Settings</strong>: <em>Where</em> and <em>when</em> have your stories taken place?</li>
<li><strong>Conflict and change</strong>: Education means bettering yourself which inevitably involves change so:
<ul>
<li><em>How</em> have your experiences changed you?</li>
<li><em>What</em> did you learn from these experiences?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emotions</strong>: how did you <em>feel</em> at the time? Fearful, happy, excited, surprised, empowered? Looking back, how do you feel about these stories now? Have your feelings changed and if so, why?</li>
</ul>
<!-- give example and worksheet-->
<p>Write these stories down. By reflecting on them and articulating them, you will improve your self awareness. Ultimately, some of these stories can eventually be distilled down into content on your CV (with emotions edited out!), see section @ref(care).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Ikigai: Reason for Being</h3>
<p>Many of the learning outcomes described above are non-trivial. You may have good self-awareness and be able to describe aspects of who you are in a matter of minutes. Other personality traits make take longer to uncover. You can develop better self-awareness by describing four attributes shown in Figure @ref(fig:iki-fig), together these are known as your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai">ikigai (生き甲斐)</a> or “reason for being”.</p>
<ul>
<li>what do you love doing?</li>
<li>what are you good at?</li>
<li>what does the world need?</li>
<li>what can you be paid for?</li>

</div>
<p>(ref:captioniki) Reasons for being, a concept in Japanese known as <em>ikigai</em>. According to ikigai, the most meaningful life lies at the intersection of four sets: (1) What you are good at, (2) What you love, (3) What the world needs and (4) What you can get paid for. What do <em>you</em> have in each of these sets and what are on your personal intersections? Ikigai sketch by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a></p>
<p>You’ll be lucky if you can find activities at the intersection of all four sets (<code>ikigai</code>) shown in Figure @ref(fig:iki-fig). In practice, you may realistically only be able to achieve one, two (the <code>Passion</code>, <code>Mission</code>, <code>Profession</code> and <code>Vocation</code>) or three intersections. That said, it’s still a valuable exercise to think about what is in each set for you.</p>
<p>Take a sheet of paper, draw the four overlapping rings shown in Figure @ref(fig:iki-fig), and spend five to ten minutes adding things in each ring.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your values?</li>
<li>What motivates you?</li>
<li>Are there things you like doing that you aren’t particularly good at?</li>
<li>Why does that make them enjoyable?</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5</span> Personality profiling</h3>
<p>Personality tests are designed to reveal your key characteristics, see figure @ref(fig:personality-fig). Besides helping you develop better self-awarness, they are used by some employers during job interviews. Personality tests are often part of a wider set of aptitude and psychometric tests to test measure your ability at numerical reasoning, verbal reasoning, logical reasoning and
situational judgement.</p>

<p>If you have privileges, it is important to recognise and acknowledge any advantages these have given you in life. They are a key part of your identity, who you are and your ego. If you don’t recognise your privileges then you don’t know yourself. Ask yourself <em>honestly</em>, what privileges do you have? For example, is it <em>just</em> your skills and knowledge that have got you into higher education, or have you been fortunate?</p>

<p>Imagine for a moment you are on your deathbed. Not at some point in the future, but right now.

You start having palpitations, hearing your own heartbeat <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-elektrokardiogramm">Hütter and Hilpert 2003</a>)</span> and worry what’s going on with the muscle responsible for keeping you alive.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Nurturing your future</h1>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a student, an employee or even both at the same time. To be successful at studying or working, you need to take your well-being seriously. By well-being, I mean your health and happiness. Your health isn’t just about your physical health but also your mental health and the two are very closely linked. It’s all too easy when you are busy or stressed to neglect your well-being and then <strong>bad-stuff™</strong> happens. This chapter looks at your well-being, and how you can nurture it. Because looking after yourself now will also nurture your future. 😀</p>

<p>One of the main target audiences for this textbook is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">Generation Z</a>, that’s people born sometime between the mid-nineties to early 2000’s. There’s some evidence to suggest that Gen-Z-ers like you have a higher probability than previous generations of being, as <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist">The Economist</a></em> puts it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stressed</li>
<li>Depressed</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Mental hygiene</h2>
<p>Stress can lead to many kinds of mental ill health or poor mental hygiene. Turing was put under lots of stress by his government bosses, people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Denniston">Alastair Denniston</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Menzies">Stewart Menzies</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-imitationgame">Tyldum 2014</a>)</span> When asked why he punished himself so much in training (see figure @ref(fig:turing-fig)), Alan Turing’s reply is shown in figure @ref(fig:turing-stress-fig).</p>

</div>
<p>(ref:captionturingstress) When asked why he trained so hard, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> replied: “I have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard; it’s the only way I can get some release”. Like many, Turing found running a relief from the mental pressures he was under in his job. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kottke">Kottke 2018</a>)</span> Studying can be stressful too and put you under pressure. Your academic performance at University can be significantly improved by taking regular exercise and it will improve your mental health too.

<p>University is a positive experience for many people, however like Alan, you may also experience periods of stress. This may also be accompanied by anxiety, loneliness and depression. Financial, social and academic pressures alongside concerns about employability, fallout from COVID-19, war, AI taking over the world and climate change (<em>etc</em>) can all have an impact on your wellbeing. Statistically, one in four of us will be affected by mental ill health during our lifetime. Two of the most common forms of mental ill health are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anxiety</strong>: <em>persistent</em> feelings of unease, such as worry or fear</li>
<li><strong>Depression</strong>: a low mood that <em>lasts for a long time</em> and affects your everyday life. Being affected by depression is <strong>not</strong> the same as feeling sad
<!--* loneliness and isolation
* stress, how you feel under pressure-->
<!--Your brain is a complex organ that is not fully understood, so it is not surprising that brains sometimes need treatment when things go wrong.--></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>persistent</em> and <em>lasting a long time</em> are important here because while its part of the human condition to worry and feel sad, that doesn’t <em>necessarily</em> mean you are affected by poor mental health. How long is a long time? Definitions vary, but around two weeks is a good rule of thumb. There are many forces (<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>) at play, feelings of sadness or anxiousness are normally balanced out by counteracting feelings of calm or happiness shown in figure @ref(fig:free-body-fig):</p>
<!--$F_S_A_D$-->
<ul>
<li>Forces that make you unhappy: <strong><span class="math inline">\(F\)</span><sub>SAD</sub></strong></li>
<li>Forces that make you happy: <strong><span class="math inline">\(F\)</span><sub>HAPPY</sub></strong></li>
<li>Forces that make you anxious: <strong><span class="math inline">\(F\)</span><sub>ANXIOUS</sub></strong></li>

<p>(ref:captionfreebody) Your mental health is like a balloon, acted on by forces of anxiety, calmness, happiness and sadness. These opposing forces normally balance each other out over time. Crudely speaking: (😰 + 😎) + (🙂 + 🙁) = 😐. Good mental health means your balloon stays airborne, despite the inevitable up and downs. If you are affected by poor mental health, feelings of anxiety or sadness will outweigh their counterparts, leading to <em>persistent</em> anxiousness or depression. This will cause your balloon (mental health) to “crash”. This chapter introduces what these mental health issues are and what you can do if you, or someone you know, is affected by poor mental health. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_body_diagram">Free body diagram</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a> 🎈</p>

<p>Millions of people around the world live with depression. If you are affected by depression it can be really hard to talk about it as there are many social stigmas around mental health. Thankfully depression is largely preventable and treatable. Recognising depression and seeking help is the first and most critical step towards recovery. To mark <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day">World Mental Health Day</a> writer and illustrator Matthew Johnstone tells the story of how he overcame the “black dog of depression” in the video in Figure @ref(fig:sad-vid) made in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>

<p>A common issue with poor mental health is that the people affected often don’t realise they need help, partly because of the social stigmas that prevent people talking about mental health in the first place.

<p>Harvard Psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_R._Santos">Laurie Santos</a> describes five evidence-based strategies for coping when times are really challenging and tough in the video in figure @ref(fig:laurie-vid). Those strategies are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Exercise</strong>: getting regular exercise improves both physical AND mental health.</li>
<li><strong>Gratitude</strong>: research shows that being grateful can significantly improve your mental health. One way to do this is by keeping a gratitude journal, a log you fill in everyday of things you are grateful for. This can include both the small and big things in life.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep</strong>: actively developing healthier sleep patterns. Poor sleep hygiene can be both cause and effect of poor mental health. See the discussion of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Sleep">Why We Sleep</a></em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-whywesleep">M. Walker 2018</a>)</span> in section @ref(signposts3)</li>
<li><strong>Socialising</strong>: give a higher priority to spending time with friends and family. There is good evidence to show this will make you happier than turning inward or diving deeper into work which could just make you more stressed, depressed or anxious <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lauranxiety">Marchese 2022</a>)</span></li>
<li><strong>Mindfulness</strong>: be mindful of emotions using the R.A.I.N. technique:
<ul>
<li><strong>R</strong>ecognise: negative emotions</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>ccept: accept and allow emotions rather than fighting or ignoring them</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>nvestigate: notice how the emotion feels inside your body</li>
<li><strong>N</strong>urture: be kind to yourself, step away from your emotions by distancing yourself from them.<!--Ruby Wax calls this non-identification which is the same thing--></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>It can help to think of negative emotions as coming from another person, an inner critic, rather than yourself. You are not your emotions and thoughts. Laurie explains the R.A.I.N. technique in figure @ref(fig:laurie-vid).</p>

<p>Sometimes a desire to be productive by overworking has exactly the opposite effect, because the sacrifices you make for work can be counter-productive. If you burn too brightly you might burnout completely, see <a href="https://mentalhealth-uk.org/burnout/">mentalhealth-uk.org/burnout</a>. 🔥</p>
<!--see https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/454-->
<p>Sacrificing sleep, socialising, exercise and time-out to recharge your batteries can make you <em>less</em> productive, especially in the longer term.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Help is available if you need it</h2>
<p>If you are affected by mental ill health, particularly anxiety or depression, it can be hard:</p>
<ul>
<li>to recognise that you need help in the first place</li>
<li>to help yourself using self-help resources</li>
<li>to ask others to help you</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you don’t need help, it is important to recognise and understand the symptoms of mental ill health. It’s quite likely that someone you know will suffer from mental health issues and as their friend or peer, it might be you that can help by encouraging them to get the help they wouldn’t otherwise ask for.</p>

Turing took up long-distance running and was good enough to come close to being selected for the English national team and competing in the Olympics.  It is no coincidence that alongside Turing's extraordinary mental capabilities he had good physical health because these abilities complement each other. If you look after your physical health, you will be able to relieve the stresses and anxieties in your life to improve your mental health.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Developing a growth mindset</h2>
<p>Learning at University can be hard because you might have gone from being at (or near) the top of the class in high school to no longer being top of the class at University.</p>
<p>Likewise the job hunting described in chapter @ref(finding) can take a heavy toll on your mental health because repeated rejection is an ordinary part of the process. It can be time consuming, stressful and demoralising. You may find your applications disappear into a black hole. They will be ghosted (ignored) by employers. Interviewers will blank you and refuse to give you meaningful feedback because they’re too busy. This could happen multiple times. This is all <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/par_for_the_course">par for the course</a></em>, normal and expected, and is not necessarily a reflection on your abilities or potential. See the examples in the coding interview section @ref(codinginterview). <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-youtube-petia">Davidova 2021</a>)</span></p>

(#fig:fixedminset-fig)(ref:captionfixedmindset)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionfixedmindset) A fixed mindset is monolithic like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moai">Easter island statues (moʻai)</a>. If you’re not already, you should be wary of a fixed mindset. <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/fixed-mindsets/">Fixed mindsets</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a></p>
<p>Adopting a growth mindset can be a successful strategy for maintaining your wellbeing, see figure @ref(fig:fixedminset-fig). If your grades aren’t has good as you hoped or your search for employment is being met with repeated rejection, a growth mindset can help. Let’s take rejection from potential employers as an example, there are two ways you can react to it:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><em>Fixed mindset</em></strong>: responding with a fixed mindset will mean you are likely to take rejection personally. You might even assume that this confirms what you’ve always suspected. You’re not good enough or that you made some fatal mistake in your applications or interviews. Ouch.</li>
<li><strong><em>Growth mindset</em></strong>: by responding to rejection with a growth mindset, you focus on what happens next. Rejection is not failure but a “not yet” described in figure @ref(fig:not-vid). Maybe you’re not yet ready for that employer, but you’ll definitely have a good idea of what you learned from the process and how can you do better next time.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Stanford psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck">Carol Dweck</a> we can all be placed on a spectrum describing where we think our abilities come from. At one end, the fixed mindset assumes all kinds of abilities are fixed traits while at the other end, a growth mindset assumes these abilities can be developed over time. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dweck">Dweck 2017</a>)</span> There is good evidence that adopting a growth mindset will make you a better learner who can cope with the inevitable failures and rejections in life better. This approach can be used in a range of different disciplines such as learning programming languages <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Cutts2010">Cutts et al. 2010</a>)</span>, music <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Davis2016">V.

Even if you’re not affected, there is a 25% chance you will be at some point in your life. There’s also a high probability someone close to you will suffer from mental health issues. It might be a colleague, friend, family member, fellow student or partner, so it is worth educating yourself on the issues by reading his two short books:</p>

<p>Anxiety and depression are serious conditions that are very likely to affect you or somebody close to you while you are at University. There’s a one in four chance that you will be affected by mental health issues at some point in your life.</p>
<p>We’ve only talked about two particular mental health issues, anxiety and depression, but there are many other conditions such as phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, self-harm and more that are beyond the scope of this chapter. They do have one thing in common, and that is that talking about them is an important part of starting to develop better mental health. Mental health can affect everyone, all genders, classes and races.</p>

<p>We all have strengths and weaknesses, and for students of Computer Science, it is often their communication skills that let them down. Other chapters in this guidebook discuss the fundamental communication skills of <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/speaking">speaking</a>, <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/hearing">listening</a> and <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/reading">reading</a>.

One of my tutees<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> once told me they chose to study computing because (quote) <em>“… I didn’t like all the arty-farty humanities subjects at school. Literature, history, languages, culture, all those essays we had to write and debates about politics. Bla bla bla. I hated that stuff!”</em> My tutee preferred the precision and accuracy of mathematics and science. Fair enough, but while you can <em>run</em> from written and spoken communication, but you can’t <em>hide</em> from it. Writing a CV, covering letter or filling in an application form is just the tip of the <em>natural language iceberg</em>, section @ref(nle) outlines the some of the rest.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Writing as a soft social skill</h2>
<p>Your soft social skills will take a <strong>life time</strong> to develop and are <strong>really hard</strong> use. Why? Because soft skills are about <em>communicating</em> with and <em>understanding</em> other people so that you can work <em>together</em> as a team toward a shared goal. Despite their name, soft skills are hard.</p>
<p>There are very few jobs where you work on your own in complete isolation. For example, most software and hardware is designed, built, tested and used by teams of people. Many of these teams are large and have very diverse membership. This means that sooner or later you’re going to have to master the dark arts of <em>working with other people</em> by developing and deploying your softer skills. One of those softer skills you’ll need to continuously develop is written communication.</p>
<p>Communicating with other people and working in teams is inherently difficult because we’re all human. There is good news and bad news…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>THE GOOD NEWS</strong> is, people can be diligent, humble, competent, honest, caring and reliable. They can be co-operative, generous, supportive, kind, thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive, understanding, punctual and professional too!</li>
<li><strong>THE BAD NEWS</strong> is, unfortunately people can also be lazy, stupid, ignorant, vain, incompetent, dishonest, unreliable, greedy, egomaniacal, unpredictable and moody. They can be proud, selfish, competitive, lustful, angry, envious, mean, busy, insensitive and thoughtless too. Some will disagree with you, boss you around, betray, exploit, misunderstand and mislead you, deliberately or otherwise. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sevendeadly">Goble 2007</a>)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This <em>shouldn’t</em> be news to you but it means communicating with and understanding other people can be hard work, but don’t worry, <strong>everyone</strong> finds this challenging, it’s not just you! It doesn’t matter if you’re an extrovert or an introvert, communication is a challenge for everybody, and everyone can get better at it too. It’s easy to undervalue the importance of communication because we use it everyday. Just as humanities students are sometimes guilty of being ignorant of science, your average science and engineering student is often guilty of underestimating the importance of the humanities, language and culture, as shown in figure @ref(fig:cpsnow-fig).</p>

<p>(ref:captioncpsnow) Many Computer Scientists are steeped in the culture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics">Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics</a> (STEM), seperated by a gulf of mutual incomprehension from their counterparts in the humanities. C.P.

<p>It probably doesn’t help that in the UK, and several other countries, many students specialise early in their education by choosing between:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EITHER</strong> a predominantly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics">science, technology, engineering, and mathematics</a> (STEM) pathway</li>
<li><strong>OR</strong> an “artier” and allegedly more “creative” humanities pathway <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-notcreatives">Cole 2017</a>)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Are C.P. Snow’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures">two (seperate) cultures of humanities and science</a> still living in seperate houses like an estranged and bickering couple? Would he judge the gaps between the two cultures to have closed or been widened in the sixty years since he described them? <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-twocultures">Snow 1959</a>)</span> This is debateable but in the worst case scenario, two cultures in society produces:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>humanities graduates who are articulate, well read, vocal, persuasive and write clearly but sometimes lack technical skills. In extreme cases, they can be scientificially and mathematically illiterate</li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Computing is your superpower!</h2>
<p>Studying computer science gives you an <em>awesome</em> superpower. We will look at some of the reasons why in chapter @ref(computing) on <em>Computing your Future</em>. But for now, let us just acknowledge that hard technical skills in computing are highly sought after and valuable, both commercially and otherwise.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

What is your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_heel">Achilles’ heel</a>? For some scientists and engineers, their weakness is their soft skills, such as communication. Writing, reading, speaking and listening to communicate with team members can be a weaker skill for many technical people. This chapter looks at what you can do to improve these skills and convince employers that you are rounded individual with a healthy balance of soft and hard skills. <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/achilles-heel-to-superpower/">Achilles heel to superpower</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a></p>
<p>Your computational superpower is less powerful if it isn’t complemented by a broad range of softer skills. Typically, these skills are not closely examined in most computer science degrees, for example by repeated assessment. There’s an awful lot of <a href="https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations">technical computing curriculum</a> that tends to have a higher priority over soft skills. It’s not that soft skills aren’t important but that they can be hard to quantify.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to know how good you are at understanding the syntax and semantics of a programming language like Python, there are tried and tested techniques for measuring this. However, if I want to know how good you are at using your communication skills to work in a team of engineers to negotiate, lead, resolve conflicts, persuade others, show empathy etc that’s <strong>much</strong> harder to measure accurately. What technical degrees tend to measure is technical skills because softer skills, shown in figure @ref(fig:allskills-fig), are much harder to assess by examination and coursework.</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons that you are much more than your grades, see figure @ref(fig:more-than-grades-fig).</p>

<p>(ref:captionallskills) Hard skills and soft skills aren’t much use without each other.

</div>
<div id="cio" class="section level2" number="4.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Communication I/0</h2>
<p>In terms of input and output, your fundamental communication skills are listening, speaking, reading and writing words in natural languages shown in table @ref(tab:iotable). These are the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly languages</a>” of human communication. This might sound blindingly obvious, but these skills are often under-estimated or undervalued by engineers and scientists, especially undergraduates. Alongside verbal and written communication, there’s also nonverbal language, or body language such as eye contact, gestures and facial expressions.</p>

<li>the nerdy software engineer stereotype who prefers the company of computers to people</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, these are lazy tropes and unhelpful stereotypes, but they express public perception of scientists and engineers as poor communicators. Don’t perpetuate the stereotype by being a bad communicator.</p>

<p>Written communication skills are important because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Good writing and reading are crucial in applications</strong> for employment and further study. From writing CV’s, covering letters, completing application forms and reading job specifications, and employer (or course) information, your ability to read and write in natural languages is crucial to coding your future.</li>
<li><strong>Writing often gets neglected</strong>: Written communication skills (both reading and writing) are sometimes sidelined in science and engineering degrees. This is particularly true in the “hard sciences”. For example, communicating and solving problems using code or mathematics are usually the dominant forms of assessment in computer science courses. That’s understandable given the subject, but tends to push natural languages (like english) to the sidelines.</li>
<li><strong>Good engineers are also good writers</strong> Many engineers (and scientists) could significantly improve their written communication skills. Software engineers are notoriously bad at writing, see for example <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/960492.960525">Why Computer Science Students Need Language</a>, <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Beaubouef2003">Beaubouef 2003</a>)</span> <em>Scientists Must Write</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-scientistsmustwrite">Barrass 2002</a>)</span> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-real-reason-silicon-valley-coders-write-bad-software/263377/">The Real Reason Silicon Valley Coders Write Bad Software</a>, <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-writebadsoftware">Meisler 2012</a>)</span> just three examples amongst many others making exactly the same point. Employers like Google provide training (and a whole career path) for technical writers, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/tech-writing">developers.google.com/tech-writing</a>. I’m glad they exist, but these careers and courses wouldn’t be needed if software engineers were better at documenting, explaining and communicating with other human beings in the first place!</li>
<li><strong>Writing good english is like writing good code</strong>. Some of the skills you already have in coding can be transferred to written communication. Just like a good <code>function</code>, <code>class</code> or <code>method</code> in code should be well-defined with a clear purpose, your writing should also be clear and coherent. Well structured writing is a lot like well architected software too, with a clear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a> (SoC)</li>
<li><strong>It is relatively easy to improve</strong> your written communication skills, simply by reading and writing more. Reading and writing deliberately every day, will significantly improve these skills. See the rest of this chapter for some simple exercises to get started with and:

We need to examine some of these different functions, because they are easily overlooked and taken for granted, especially by engineers and scientists. We read, write and rewrite everyday without stopping to give it much thought. If you don’t like writing, you need to learn to love it because it’s actually your friend. Not just any friend, but your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_friends_forever">Best Friend Forever</a> (BFF), see figure @ref(fig:bff-fig).</p>

<p>So let’s expand on each of the reasons in figure @ref(fig:bff-fig) why writing is your new BFF:</p>
<div id="communicating" class="section level3" number="4.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1</span> Writing as communication</h3>
<p>Writing is communication, see figure @ref(fig:comms-fig). Well Duh! I’m stating the obvious, because you will sometimes hear software engineers talking disparagingly about writing the (<em>sigh</em>)<code>documentation</code>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p class="caption">
(#fig:comms-fig)(ref:captioncomms)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captioncomms) Your writing will often communicate better if you invest more time in rewriting to make it clearer. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_can_telephone">Tin can telephone</a> sketch by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a></p>
<p>Engineers may sometimes tell you that writing about their software or hardware can be a chore. If they bother to write about their software at all, they often do it at the end, <em>if</em> there is time and there’s no more features to be added or bugs to be removed. This might go some way to explaining why software and hardware documentation can be so bad because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is probably written as an afterthought or in a hurry</li>
<li>It might not be authored by the person who actually designed or built the software</li>
<li>The documentation may be describing complex processes or very abstract concepts</li>
<li>It may have been mangled with the original meaning lost in translation to a different (natural) language</li>
<li>The author may lack empathy with their readers<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>A good example of this is the documentation for the distributed version control system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a>. While <code>git</code> is a powerful tool that is worth spending time learning about, like most powerful tools, it is also quite complicated. Some of the documentation on git is very good <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-progit">Chacon and Straub 2014</a>)</span> but other parts of it tend towards impenetrable jargon-ridden nonsense. Take this example selected by <a href="https://github.com/spderosso">Santiago Perez De Rosso</a> from the documentation describing a command known as <code>git-wave-stash</code> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-youtube-git">Rosso 2017</a>)</span></p>
<blockquote>
wave all staged stashes next to various cherry-picked non-applied applied trees
<footer>
— Anon <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sigman07">Rosso and Jackson 2016</a>)</span>
</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you work out what that actually means? Me neither. No doubt, you can think of many other examples where you’ve been reading documentation and thought <code>WTF</code>? This is just one example from many that shows why good writing is crucial for communication.</p>
<p>Badly written text like the example above, fails to communicate with the reader. We’ve all been on the receiving end of badly written prose, especially when it comes to software and hardware documentation. When it is done well, writing quickly communicates what readers actually need to understand.</p>
</div>
<div id="recording" class="section level3" number="4.5.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2</span> Writing as recording</h3>
<p>What were you doing on the March 6th 2013? You probably don’t know and I’ll bet you would probably struggle to find out. I don’t know what I was doing on March 6th 2013 either because I have no written records for that day. If I was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder">obsessive–compulsive diarist</a> (OCD), I’d have a written record of what happened to me on that day. But I’m not, so I don’t. The point here is that, writing doesn’t just communicate it also <em>records</em> what has happened, see figure @ref(fig:start-record-fig).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/8%20reasons%20why%20writing%20-%20Recording.png" alt="(ref:captionrecording)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:start-record-fig)(ref:captionrecording)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionrecording) If you don’t write it down there will be no record that it actually happened, whatever <em>it</em> was. While it is difficult to know in advance exactly what you might need to record, the safest option is to write as much of it as you can anyway, just in case. Old school reel to reel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_recorder">tape recorder</a> sketch by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a></p>
<p>If it <em>might</em> be important, it is <em>probably</em> worth writing down. Even things you think are trivial are still worth writing down as they might turn out to be important later:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minutes from a meeting<br />
</li>
<li>Lecture notes you’ve written</li>
<li>A bug you’ve been working on including how you fixed it</li>
</ul>
<!--https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1554456645530435588-->
<p>So besides communicating, writing records what happened. If you don’t write it down, it might just disappear forever without trace. The audience you’ll be communicating with isn’t just other people, it might be your future self. That future self might <em>really</em> need to know how you fixed that bug, and it could save you <em>hours</em> of re-figuring out how to solve a problem you’ve already solved.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.3</span> Writing as leadership</h3>
<p>Have you ever felt moved or influenced by a piece of writing? Have you ever read something that motivated or influenced you to do something? Of course you have.

</div>
<p>(ref:captionconstitution) <em>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men</em> (and women) <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal">are created equal</a>…</em> Just words written down on a piece of paper, but words that made people follow. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-declarationofi">Jefferson et al. 1776</a>)</span> Declaration sketch by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a></p>
<p>Let’s take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a> shown in figure @ref(fig:constitution-fig). We’re still talking (and singing) about it more than 200 years after it was written. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-declarationofi">Jefferson et al. 1776</a>; <a href="#ref-alexanderhamilton">Miranda 2015</a>)</span> That’s not just because it was influential, it’s because it was written down. The seemingly mundane and lo-tech but hi-fi act of humble writing. The declaration is “just” words, written down on a piece of paper, but words that changed the course of history.</p>
<p>You say you want a revolution? Well, you know, we all want to change the world. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-revolution">Lennon and McCartney 1968</a>)</span> Whatever kind of revolution you want to start or join, you’ll stand a much better chance of making it happen, if you write down your ideas in a way that people can clearly understand. This might include mini-revolutions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting a job interview, by crafting a persuasive covering letter and compellng CV</li>
<li>Encouraging people to join <code>projects</code> you’ve started, see section @ref(mycvpj)</li>
<li>Negotiating terms and conditions of a contract of employment, you might start by email</li>
<li>Getting someone to invest in your startup or offer you some freelance or contract work</li>
<li>… and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>So writing well won’t just help you communicate and record, it will help you to become a more successful leader too by specifying exactly what you mean so you can convince other people to follow your lead.</p>

<div id="slowing" class="section level3" number="4.5.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.4</span> Writing as slowing down</h3>
<p>Your brain tends to work <em>much</em> more quickly than your fingers can type or your hands can write. Your brain will often work much faster than you can speak as well. Writing can slow that process down to something more manageable and concrete, by focussing your thoughts on a given topic or problem, see figure @ref(fig:slowing-fig).</p>

<p>Writing forces you to say more <em>exactly</em> what you are thinking. Slowly. Whereas thoughts can be fast, vague and slippery, writing needs to be much more precise and accurate. The author and playwright <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif_Kureishi">Hanif Kureishi</a> writes to find out what he thinks, see figure @ref(fig:hanif-fig). Working out what you think takes time, one of reasons writing can be challenging or lead to the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block">writer’s block</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-whyiwrite">Orwell 1946</a>)</span></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.5</span> Writing as problem solving</h3>
<p>Ever got stuck on a difficult problem? Ever tried writing that problem down or articulating the details to a rubber duck? There’s something about writing a problem down or articulating the issue to another person. Even a rubber duck will do, see figure @ref(fig:rubber-duck-fig). So writing can be a useful technique for solving problems, even if nobody else ever reads what you’ve written or heard what you’ve spoken.</p>

<p>By the time you’ve written that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a> question about a techincal problem you are struggling to solve, your brain may have figured it out.

<div id="product" class="section level3" number="4.5.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.6</span> Writing as a process, not just a product</h3>
<p>When you are writing a CV, résumé or a covering letter, the <em>product</em> of your writing is the most important output. But sometimes, it is the <em>process</em> of writing that matters more than the product, see figure @ref(fig:process-fig).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/8%20reasons%20why%20writing%20-%20Process%20(not%20product).png" alt="(ref:captionprocess)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:process-fig)(ref:captionprocess)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionprocess) Sometimes the <em>process</em> of writing (the blue bit) is more important than the <em>product</em> of writing (the red output). Process sketch by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a></p>
<p>Here are some examples where the process of writing can be more important than its product:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking notes helps you concentrate on what a speaker is saying</li>
<li>Writing a reflection which forces you to analyse on what has happened and what you’ll do next, see section @ref(reflecting). Cognitive psychologists call this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition">metacognition</a>, thinking about thinking</li>
<li>Writing down a problem helps you to solve it, as described in section @ref(solving)</li>
</ul>
<p>So writing is important as a <em>process</em> as well as a <em>product</em>. That process might include slowing down (section @ref(slowing)), speeding up (section @ref(accelerating)) or both. Either way, writing forces you to be clear and focus, it is a <em>process</em> for working, not just the <em>product</em> (output) of working. When you write a dissertation or thesis for your bachelors or masters degree the process of writing is as important as the product. The computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Peyton_Jones">Simon Peyton Jones</a> outlines how recognising this can help you to write a better dissertation or thesis in figure @ref(fig:peyton-jones-vid).</p>

<p>Besides being a tool for communication, writing can be therapeutic for the writer too. The simple act of writing can help you tackle mental health issues discussed in chapter @ref(nurturing). You might think it tragic somebody writing a diary that nobody reads, but actually, that’s not the only point of the diary.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.8</span> Writing as speeding up</h3>
<p>As well as slowing your brain down discussed in section @ref(slowing), writing can also speed it up by <em>wicking</em> ideas like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_wick">candle wick</a> does for candle wax. Without the wick, the candle wax can’t undergo the chemical reaction that transforms it into carbon dioxide and water. As the software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)">Paul Graham</a> puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
“If I can’t write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets in the way of having the next. Pen and paper wick ideas”

</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>and also</p>
<blockquote>
“I think it’s far more important to write well than most people realise. Writing doesn’t just communicate ideas; it generates them. If you’re bad at writing and don’t like to do it, you’ll miss out on most of the ideas writing would have generated”

<p>(ref:captiondogfooding) Reading your own writing (aloud) is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">eating your own dog food</a>.

<p>Dogfooding is a simple technique for testing your own writing. Let’s say you’ve just written a personal statement or covering letter (see section @ref(we3qs)). It’s natural to read it over in your head to check for errors, before you send it. However, <strong>reading it aloud</strong> will pick up errors you may not have spotted by reading silently. Your ears and tongue will pick up on awkward phrases and sentences that your eyes didn’t spot. There’s something about articulating words out loud that flushes out errors you don’t pick up when you read them in your head. Dogfooding is a tried and tested technique. It also means you’re ready to vocalise those answers in an interview.</p>
<p>You might want to choose carefully where you do this as it might look a bit strange, but it works well. If you talk into a mobile phone while looking at a piece of paper, people won’t notice you’re talking to yourself. But you’ll probably need some privacy as the stuff you’re talking about is likely to be personal. Alternatively, find a critical friend who you can read out loud to. You can also use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen reader</a>, for example :</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Teams has an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/education/products/learning-tools">immersive reader</a></li>

<li>Apple devices have <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph3e2e415f/ios">VoiceOver</a></li>

<p>There is no shortage of software to help you write better, beyond the basic spelling and grammar checkers described in section @ref(spelling). The more sophisticated tools are often powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hogarth">Hogarth 2023</a>)</span> Some of these tools are tailored to improving academic writing while others can be used to improve your written job applications.

<p>(ref:captionchatgpt) Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT">ChatGPT</a>) is a chatbot developed by <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI.com</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gpt4">Altman 2023</a>)</span> It is built on top of OpenAI’s GPT-4 family of large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model">language models</a> and has been fine-tuned using both supervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques. ChatGPT is one of several <em>writing machines</em> or <em>robo-writers</em> that you can potentially use as an assistant to help you communicate more quickly and clearly. Note that despite the name, the language model that ChatGPT is built on is NOT openly available. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-notopenai">Dis et al. 2023</a>)</span> OpenAI logo from Wikimedia Commons <a href="https://w.wiki/6Lat">w.wiki/6Lat</a> adapted using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238">Wikipedia App</a></p>
<p>All of these tools will be biased by whatever data they’ve been trained on and encode some of the prejudices of the engineers that wrote their algorithms. You need to be careful about plagirism (if it is academic work) and writing generic job applications that are de-personalised and de-humanised. Employers will be able to spot these a mile off.</p>
<p>Another problem with using writing machines to help you communicate is that while the more sophisticated software might help overcome some of the dreaded <em>writer’s block</em>, they bypass the important <em>process</em> of writing discussed in section @ref(product). Writing about something is one of the best ways to learn about it, and sometimes the best time to write is when you’re trying to figure out the subject for yourself. If you wait until you’re an expert, it will be too late to start. If you get a machine like ChatGPT to write for you, you won’t identify gaps in your knowledge and develop the expertise to fill them.</p>
<p>So viewing writing as just another kind of <code>output</code>, overlooks a lot of the value of writing in the first place.</p>
<p>Despite their limitations, and the fact that we’re still trying to figure out what their long term impacts will be, writing machines may help you to communicate more clearly and quickly. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mairead">Pratschke 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-noordenai">Stokel-Walker and Noorden 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-hutsonai">Hutson 2021</a>)</span></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.4</span> Writers are fighters!</h3>
<p>Another technique for improving your written communication is to deliberately write something every day, that might be a personal diary that only you read, or it could be something more public like blog. Schedule a time every day, say 15 to 30 minutes when you will do this without fail. Sometimes this will be easy, other times it will be hard. What’s important is that you write something, see figure @ref(fig:jodi-picoult-fig). That writing could take several forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>public web log or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blog</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal">gratitude journal</a> see section @ref(lays)</li>
<li>private diary or personal laboratory notebook</li>

</ul>
<p>The technique of <em>30 minutes per day</em> can be a very effective way of getting things done, incrementally over time. In my experience it works for lots of things besides writing including getting exercise (discussed in chapter @ref(nurturing)) to gardening. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-leendertz">Leendertz 2006</a>)</span></p>

<!--Professionalism can be defined several ways but [Robert C. Martins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin)'s definition is a good starting point. In *The Clean Coder* [@cleancoder], he defines a professional as someone who is accountable and responsible, not just taking responsibility for what they build but being responsible for their own career. Being a professional relies on both soft and hard skills.-->
<!--Employers often talk about skills gaps, skills crises [@oilandgaskills; @mindthegap] and labour shortages of various kinds. [@digitalskillscrisis; @softskillscrisis; @shadboltreview] They frequently point out that various combinations of skills can be problematic to find and develop in their employees, [@brucetulgan] and even that they fight a “war for talent” [@warfortalent]. As a science and engineering student you get lots of opportunities to develop hard skills. However, while hard technical skills are important for your future, your soft skills are just as likely to get you hired, promoted or even fired. [@nicegirls; @rocketscience; @jonathanblack; @paulredmond; @helpihaveamanager] Soft skills are hard to learn but well worth spending your time and effort to develop.-->

You can go a step further by enrolling on some humanities courses where you’ll develop your these skills even more.</p>
<p>Written communication skills are only the tip of the soft skills iceberg. Teamwork, negotiation, conflict resolution, public speaking, motivating others and leadership are also important soft skills too. How can you develop these skills while at University? How can you demonstrate to potential employers that you have these skills?

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Why is experience so valuable?</h2>
<p>You are <em>much more</em> than your grades, because your education is only a part of who you are. You are the sum total of your experiences, this is one of the reasons that experience is so valuable, see figure @ref(fig:experience-fig). It’s common for students to be focused on their grades, whether those grades are low, middling or or high. At the extremes, if you have got lower grades than you’d like, you might be anxious or unhappy about them. If you’ve got higher grades, you’re probably focussed on keeping them high. While its important to focus on getting the best grades you can, employers are interested in the whole you rather than narrowly focusing on your academic education. Alongside your academic achievements, there is also your:</p>

<p>So what counts as <code>experience</code>? I’m going to use experience to mean applying what you’ve learnt in your formal education <em>outside</em> of school or University, this includes but is not limited to, paid employment. Employers use terms to describe jobs and experience for undergraduates and graduates inconsistently. So I’ve defined and outlined terms for relevant kinds of experience shown in table @ref(tab:jobterms) and we’ll use these definitions throughout this guidebook.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Other experience</h3>
<!-- to do compare and contrast summer vs year long-->
<p>Some of the experience outlined in table @ref(tab:jobterms) was probably what you were already thinking of as experience, however there are four other important sources of experience that students often overlook:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Voluntary work</strong>: Any kind of work where you’ve given your time and labour to a community. That could be non-technical (working for a charity) or technical, such as contributing to open-source software, see section @ref(opensource) and figure @ref(fig:volunthero-fig)</li>
<li><strong>Casual work</strong>: Working in hospitality or retail (etc) is often overlooked by students as an important source of relevant experience. It doesn’t have to be technical to be relevant to employers, see section @ref(casual)</li>
<li><strong>Tinkering</strong>: having passion projects as a playground to help you learn new skills and knowledge, either solo or collaboratively see section @ref(tinkering). For more competitive employers, passion projects are likely to be more important. To get into ultra-competitive industries like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry">video game industry</a>, candidates are often expected to have a portfolio of one or two games developed <em>outside</em> of University, and these will be more interesting to employers than what (or where) you’ve studied <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-aswift">Hanuk et al. 2022</a>)</span></li>
<li><strong>Student societies</strong> Your students’ union will have hundreds of official societies you can get involved in, and they’ll be plenty of unofficial fringe communities too. As well as helping you develop new or existing interests, these societies give you an opportunity to serve a particular community of interest. Many societies seek members to take on positions of responsibility, above and beyond merely participating in their events. They provide fantastic opportunities to build new skills in a safe and supportive environment.</li>

<p>(ref:captionvolunthero) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering">Volunteering</a> is a great source of experience that employers value. That could mean volunteering for charitable causes, taking responsibility in a student society or getting involved in open source projects.

For example, many large employers run <a href="https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights">insight days, vacation schemes and spring weeks</a>. These are often aimed at first year undergraduates, and are sometimes less competitive to get into than a longer term commitment such as a summer internship, year-long placement or even graduate job.

</div>
<div id="smallnames" class="section level3" number="5.3.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.4</span> Smaller name experience</h3>
<p><em>Any</em> experience will help your CV stand out. Smaller name employers have the advantage that they tend to be less picky than big household names so it is often easier to get a foot in the door. It might not be what you see yourself doing in the longer term, but the experience and opportunities you gain working in a small company can be invaluable.</p>
<p>To use a footballing analogy, let’s imagine you dream of playing for the world’s greatest football team: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.">Manchester United</a>. Unfortunately, the talent scouts at United don’t return any of your calls or emails about vacancies for younger players and its incredibly hard to get a chance to speak to them in person. However, if you prove yourself at a smaller club, that would be a start. This is how most professional footballers start, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford">Marcus Rashford</a> shown in figure @ref(fig:rashford-fig). What works in football can also work in employment too. You might even decide that big clubs are over-rated and you prefer playing for smaller clubs anyway <em>or</em> a smaller employer could be your stepping stone to bigger things. Of course, you want to be ambitious and find what is best for you but ignoring opportunities with smaller employers will severely restrict your options. At the very least, small name experience will get some evidence on your CV and start to buid your professional network.</p>

<p>There are lots of different motivations for getting involved in open source, shown in figure @ref(fig:opensource-fig). Whatever your motivation, contributing to open source software is fun, you’ll learn heaps and it will look <em>great</em> on your CV. Open source software is widely used by, so contributing is a great way to get some real world experience of software development. Many open source projects are funded by employers both large and small, and you can get paid to develop open source software through projects like Google’s Summer of Code. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gsoc">Googler 2023</a>)</span></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose a project with several active contributors, so that there is a community to help you</li>
<li>Choose a relatively popular project (with some GitHub stars) so that you can avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware">abandonware</a> but…</li>
<li>… Avoid “blockbuster” projects like <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow">tensorflow</a> or <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">vscode</a> , so that your contributions will not get lost in the politics and bureaucracy of a large project</li>
<li>Verify that you can build and run the project from your own setup</li>
<li>Ensure the project regularly accepts pull requests from outsiders, so that your contributions will have a chance of being accepted</li>
<li>Contribute a trivial fix to start with to test your ability use the project’s workflows</li>

<p>(ref:captionhackathon) Most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathons</a> are collaborative and social events where you can learn how to rapidly prototype ideas in a friendly and supportive environment.

<p>Attending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">Hackathons</a> is another way to learn and gain <code>experience</code> by tinkering, in a collaborative and social environment, see figure @ref(fig:hackathon-fig). The word hackathon is a portmanteau of hacking (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture">hacker culture</a> not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker">security hacking</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon">marathon</a>. Hackathons tend to be short (24 to 48 hours) but intense, see for example:</p>

</ul>
<p>Alongside these competitions, there are other hackathon-type events which are organised by a single employer, see section @ref(bignames). There are also opportunities to build your technical experience by practicing coding interviews online such as hackerrank and leetcode, described in section @ref(codinginterview).</p>
<p>Passion projects like these help to distinguish you from your peers, but they don’t <em>have</em> to be technical, see section @ref(casual) and @ref(volunteering). You might feel that you are too busy to do any passion projects, but if working hard on academic study and getting top grades means that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neglect hobbies, interests and friends</li>
<li>Start to suffer from anxiety or depression</li>
<li>Only have <code>projects</code> that were a compulsory part of your formal education</li>
</ul>
<p>It might be time to reflect and consider re-balancing your priorities if you can.</p>

<div id="casual" class="section level3" number="5.3.8">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.8</span> Casual experience</h3>
<p>You may already have experience of paid employment as a casual or part-time worker. This could include jobs such as waiting tables, serving in a bar or working in other areas of hospitality or retail, for example as a Saturday job.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/Titanic-paperboy-crop.jpeg" alt="(ref:captionpaperboy)" width="99%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:paperboy-fig)(ref:captionpaperboy)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionpaperboy) Casual and part-time work tell an important story about you on your CV. For example, from the age of 12, I was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy">paperboy</a>, delivering newspapers directly to the doors of paying customers. This demonstrates reliability and work ethic, because I did this in all weathers (sun, wind, rain, snow, hangovers etc) for six years. If you have casual experience like this, don’t forget to include it in your CV. Public domain image of the Titanic paperboy, Ned Parfett selling newspapers in London via Wikimedia Commons at <a href="https://w.wiki/35HA">w.wiki/35HA</a> adapted using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238">Wikipedia app</a>. 🚢</p>
<p>It is important to recognise that these jobs have value. Many students make the mistake of overlooking their casual work experience because they discount it as non-technical and “low-skilled”. In section @ref(mycvst) we saw that one of the stories you want to tell in your job applications is that you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>take responsibility</li>
<li>achieve things</li>
<li>are nice to have around</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing casual work can demonstrate all of these things. For example, from the ages of 12 to 18 I was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy">paperboy</a>, except unlike the Titanic paperboy selling newspapers in the street in figure @ref(fig:paperboy-fig), I delivered newspapers directly to the doors of paying customers every morning. This was not a particularly highly skilled job, but it <em>does</em> demonstrate:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_ethic">work ethic</a>: getting up early <em>every</em> morning (including Saturdays). Sometimes work is about just turning up everyday!</li>
<li>taking responsibility and being reliable</li>
<li>understanding the value of money by earning a wage</li>
</ol>
<!-- this is repetitive, see earlier in the section-->
<p>I’ve often spoken to students who neglect to tell me about their paid work in retail or hospitality. “But it’s not technical” they say, “it’s low skilled and irrelevant”. However, serving customers demonstrates your ability to provide good customer service and work as part of a team, often under pressure, see figure @ref(fig:budgens-fig). This is good evidence of the “nice to have around” bit that Jonathan Black refers to <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-topnotchcv">J. Black 2019b</a>)</span> and is something your formal education will not typically provide much evidence of. So, don’t fall into the trap of discounting the value of casual or part-time labour.</p>

<p>(ref:captionbudgens) Early in your career, casual work in hospitality or retail, such as a supermarket like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgens">Budgens</a> where I used to work as a teenager, is worth mentioning on your CV. If you have any experience of this kind, make sure you mention it and describe the skills you developed.

<!--old name broadening -->
<p>Your future is full of exciting new possibilities, but which of these options will you choose? What are all the opportunities for students of computing? How will you choose <em>the one</em> is best for <em>you</em>? When choosing your future, do you see yourself as a <code>default user</code> or the <code>weird edge case</code> pictured in figure @ref(fig:default-user-fig)?</p>

<p>Perhaps you’re a weird edge case.

<li>working in computing in roles beyond software engineering?</li>
<li>using your technical skills more responsibly and ethically to make the world a better place?</li>
<li>starting your own business and making money for yourself, rather than other people?</li>
<li>finding <em>hidden</em> or unadvertised vacancies?</li>
<li>joining a startup instead of a large multinational corporation?</li>
<li>venturing outside of the private sector?</li>
</ul>
<p>Broadening your initial job search described in chapter @ref(finding) will open up more opportunities on your horizon. This chapter will broaden those horizons and get you to think about some of the less obvious options you can choose from.</p>
<p>Many technology jobs exist outside of technology companies, <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-outsideit">Asay 2020</a>)</span> because a lot of software is written to be <em>used</em> rather than sold. Consequently, many employers create bespoke software to fit the needs of their business. The people who build it are often employees, rather than people employed by a technology company. In the United States for example, ninety percent of IT jobs are outside the traditional tech industry. Technical jobs outside the technology sector often have the advantage of being more accessible than those within a very competitive technology sector. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-burninglass">Markow, Coutinho, and Bundy 2019</a>)</span></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Vocational or academic?</h2>
<p>Some undergraduate degrees like medicine, dentistry and nursing are highly vocational. Other degrees have a stronger academic flavour. According to some studies, vocational degrees can be the best route to highly skilled jobs. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vocational">Adams 2018</a>)</span> Computer Science degrees often develop highly vocational skills and knowledge, through disciplines like software engineering for example. They often contain more theoretical, scientific and academic topics like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation">theory of computation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability">probability theory</a> too.</p>
<p>What is the blend of vocational vs. academic study in your degree? It’s good to have a mixture of theory and practice, see figure @ref(fig:ometer-fig), because employers value both of them. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vocational">Adams 2018</a>)</span> However, unless you’re considering a career in research or academia (see chapter @ref(researching)) it’s probably the <em>vocational</em> part of your degree that will give you the clearest initial direction into paid employment.</p>

<p>These are mainly UK opportunities, but it is a similar story around the world. Many Universities and research institutes have summer internships for computer science students working alongside researchers. For example, at the University of Manchester, summer vacancies tend to be advertised each year around April/May. Wherever you are, speak to the head of a research lab you’re interested in. Ask them if they have plans to take on summer students.</p>

<p>Since there’s so much power and money tied up in computing, do computer scientists need to sell their soul to the highest or most powerful bidder for their services?

<p>So when you’re searching for jobs and researching potential employers, one of the first things you need to find out is what the values and ethical principles of an employer are, see section @ref(beware). This is a quick way to evaluate what makes an organisation who they are. Most employers publish their values and ethics openly, here’s a small selection to give you a flavour:</p>
<ul>

</div>
<p>(ref:captionmorganstanley) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley">Morgan Stanley</a> is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered in New York City. The firms clients include corporations, governments, institutions and individuals.

<p>Let’s look at Morgan Stanley (figure @ref(fig:morgan-stanley-fig)) as an example, I’ve chosen these values because they are brief and self-explanatory. Morgan Stanley’s values are to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do the right thing: act with integrity</li>
<li>Put clients first: listen to what the client is saying and needs</li>
<li>Lead with exceptional ideas: win by breaking new ground</li>
<li>Commit to Diversity and Inclusion: value individual and cultural differences</li>
<li>Give back: serve communities generously with expertise, time and money</li>
</ol>
<p>Look at these values carefully, or choose the values of another employer you’re interested in. What do they mean to you?</p>
<p>Do an employers words match their actions? The words <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">Don’t be evil</a></strong> are easy to <em>say</em> but harder to <em>action</em>. Good intentions are often easier said than done.</p>
<p>So back to our original question, do you have to sell your soul?</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t have to sell your soul <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-iwannabeadored">I. Brown and Squire 1989</a>)</span></li>
<li>It depends what’s in your soul anyway</li>

<p>It’s difficult to think of any aspect of our lives that hasn’t been changed by the invention of the digital programmable computer, just 74 short years ago. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lavington">Lavington 1998</a>)</span> Consequently, computing is a crucial skill in a wide range of careers across every sector of business and society. You don’t have to have studied Computer Science at University to take advantage of all the exciting opportunities provided by computing. This chapter looks at why computing is a subject for everyone. If you’re studying computing, this chapter isn’t aimed at you, unless you are struggling to stay motivated with your subject! 👨🏿‍💻👨‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩‍💻👨🏿‍💻</p>

<div id="ilo6" class="section level2" number="7.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> What you will learn</h2>
<p>Reading this chapter and doing the activities will help you to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify where you can get started with computing, if you’re not studying computer science as a major part of your degree</li>
<li>Discuss the role of computing in society for everyone, not just those studying it at University</li>
<li>Describe why NOT studying computer science doesn’t necessarily “lock you out” of computing as a career</li>
</ol>
<!--* Describe why computing is a stimulating and challenging subject to study in its own right
* Identify creative opportunities in computing, whatever your background-->
<p>But why should everyone be studying computing? There are social and economic arguments:</p>
</div>
<div id="creative" class="section level2" number="7.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Computing is for everybody</h2>
<p>At school, everyone learns to read, write and do maths. These are sometimes known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_three_Rs">the three Rs</a> but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did you learn to read and write? Was it so that you could become a professional writer?</li>
<li>Why did you study mathematics? Was it so that you could become a professional mathematician?</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course not, that would be ludicrous! You learned to read and write because they are fundamental tools for expressing yourself and communicating with other people. You studied maths so that you could develop numeracy, reason about the world around you, analyse data and solve problems.</p>
<p>So why should everyone learn about computing? Is it so that everyone can become software engineers? Again, this is patently ludicrous.</p>
<p>Everyone should study computing for the same reasons everyone studies maths and english at school. Like writing, computing is one of the most creative tools for expression and communication that we have today. Just like mathematics, studying computing will also help you to solve important problems too. Sam Aaron, creator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Pi">Sonic Pi</a>, puts exactly this case for creative computing in his TEDx talk <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-youtube-sonicpi">Aaron 2016</a>)</span> shown in figure @ref(fig:sonicpi-vid).</p>

<p>Computing is also an intellectually stimulating and challenging subject to study in its own right. If you don’t believe me, I’m not going to make the case here. If you are a humanities student, have a look at Silvio Peroni’s free computational thinking and programming textbook at <a href="https://comp-think.github.io/">comp-think.github.io</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-peroni">Peroni 2021</a>)</span> If you like doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">Massive Open Online Courses</a> (MOOCs), you might also enjoy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CS50">CS50</a>, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Malan">David Malan</a> shown in figure @ref(fig:malan-vid).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Software is eating your future</h2>
<p>Whatever future world you enter into after you graduate, there’s a good chance it has already been eaten by software. In 2011, the software engineer and billionaire investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreesen</a> outlined why (in his opinion, figure @ref(fig:eating-fig)) software is eating the world, in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-eatingtheworld">Andreessen 2011</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many people lack the digital skills required to take advantage of all the opportunities provided by software and computing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)">Robert Sedgwick</a> at Princeton University has, like many others, argued that Computer Science should be a <strong>required</strong> topic of study for <em>all</em> undergraduate students in University. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-robertsedgwick">Sedgwick 2019</a>)</span> We’re not there yet because computing is a subject that has historically been siloed in Computer Science Departments, but this is changing as we’ll see in this chapter. It’s not that everyone should jump ship to Computer Science, but that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists</li>

</ul>
<p>Whatever subject you are currently studying, adding some computing to your education will empower you with the computational thinking skills you need to be an active producer, not just a passive consumer in modern society. Computing can open up new opportunities for you and improve your social mobility.</p>
<!--
The gist of his argument is that Computer Science is too important to be left to Computer Scientists, because it influences every field of human endeavour.

<p>Your future is bright, your future needs computing. There are lots of opportunities in computing but you don’t <em>need</em> to have studied Computer Science at University to take advantage of them. <!--Computing your future will help you design your future. Designing your future will help you to start coding you future. --></p>
<p>Apple co-founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> likened the computer to a “<em>bicycle for our minds</em>”, see figure @ref(fig:stevejobs-fig). Just as cycling is a tool we’ve invented that makes our movement more efficient, so too computing is a tool which enables us to do some cognitive tasks more efficiently. Both computers and cycles enable us to travel further and more quickly than we could do otherwise. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t need a <em>degree</em> in cycling to make a <em>career</em> in cycling</li>
</ul>
<p>… and therefore by analogy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t need a <em>degree</em> in computing to make a <em>career</em> in computing</li>
</ul>
<p>While studying computing at University will help you ride the computational bike better, it’s not a prerequisite for riding in the first place. Steve Jobs bike can be ridden by anyone keen enough to jump on their proverbial bike and keep pedalling.</p>

<p>(ref:captionstevejobs) “I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometre. And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. So, that didn’t look so good. But, then somebody at <em>Scientific American</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-scientificbicycle">S. S. Wilson 1973</a>)</span> had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts. And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.” —Steve Jobs <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stevejobs">Jobs 1980</a>)</span> Jobs is not talking about iPhones here, more about computing generally.

<p>In this chapter, we’ve looked at some resources that can help you get started with computing if Computer Science is neither a major or minor part of your degree. They are accessible and often designed for people with little or no background in computing or mathematics. Some of them are specifically aimed at students from a humanities background. Whatever your background, you’ll need to be patient to learn the valuable skill of programming, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig">Peter Norvig</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a> it takes at least ten years (or ten thousand hours) to learn how to do it well. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tenyears">Norvig 1998</a>; <a href="#ref-outliers">Gladwell 2008</a>)</span></p>

1. What computer science subject area or specific issue or problem interests you? What are your skills? What languages do you know? What tools are you familiar with?
1. Look through the list of organisations. There's a lot of them, it might be slightly overwhelming, but you'll need to narrow it down. Pick at most 5 of them. You won't have time to look at all of them in depth so follow your interests and gut feeling.
1. Visit the org's site and repos. Look at the code, look at feature requests, issues and bug reports

* Look at the past projects of those 5. It'll become clear that some of them are generally very competitive and usually take final year or masters students for their projects. Narrow it down to 3 organisations.

1. Start engaging with mentors and other students or the community around those 3 organisations. Again, it'll become clear which projects within each organisation are the most popular. Ask for advice. Read project descriptions and draft lists of questions.
1. By the time the student application period begins, you should know which organisation you are going for, even if you're not sure about the project yet.
1. As soon as you picked a project, start working on your proposal, and start asking for feedback early on. You don't have to have a finished proposal to ask for feedback, mentors are more often than not willing to guide you.
1. Your proposal has to highlight two things well: how your background and experience are relevant to the project, and your understanding of the project. The understanding of the project part is crucial: successful applicants usually have a draft timeline. Given that there are 12 weeks, you are expected to mention what you expect to be doing each week. Importantly, after each 4 weeks, you'll have a review / milestone. Make sure it's very clear what your milestones will be.
1. Optional: if you are proposing your own project rather than picking one proposed by the organisation, you'll need to convince the organisation that your idea brings them more value than what they've already proposed. This will require a good understanding of the scope of the organisation and isn't always easy.-->

<h1><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Debugging your future</h1>
<p>It’s all very well <em>designing</em> your future but now you need to actually <em>engineer</em> your future by building something. An obvious place to start is with your CV or résumé, because that’s where most people start testing their designs. Just like with code, the hardest part isn’t <em>writing</em> it but <em>debugging</em> and <em>rewriting</em> it, repeatedly. How can you create a bug-free CV, résumé or completed application form? How can you support applications with a strong personal statement or covering letter? These documents are a crucial part of your future so how can you debug them? 🕷</p>

<p>(ref:captionbuggingcv) Is that a bug or a feature in your CV? To stand a chance of being invited to interview, you’ll need to identify and fix any bugs in your written applications.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Beware of the black hole</h2>
<p>Before we get started, let’s consider some advice from software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell">Gayle Laakmann McDowell</a>. Gayle is an experienced software engineer who has worked at some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">biggest technology employers in the world</a>: Apple, Microsoft and Google. She has also authored a cracking series of books on technology careers, particularly <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_the_Coding_Interview">Cracking the Coding Interview</a></em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cracking">McDowell 2015</a>)</span> which we’ll discuss in chapter @ref(speaking). Gayle refers to the employer “black hole” described in figure @ref(fig:gayle-fig).</p>

<p>(ref:captiongayle) Beware of what software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell">Gayle Laakmaan McDowell</a> calls the employer “Black Hole”, especially if you’re applying to large employers. “Getting through the doors, unfortunately, seems insurmountable. Hoards of candidates submit résumés each year, with only a small fraction getting an interview. The online application system – or, as it’s more appropriately nicknamed, <em>The Black Hole</em>, – is littered with so many résumés that even a top candidate would struggle to stand out.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-blackhole">McDowell 2011</a>, <a href="#ref-techcareer">2014</a>)</span> Laakmann portrait by Gayle Laakmaan is licensed CC BY 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons <a href="https://w.wiki/wiu">w.wiki/wiu</a> adapted using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238">Wikipedia app</a> Thank you Gayle for permission to use your photo. 👩‍💻</p>
<p>If you’re applying to big employers, you’ll need to create a CV that is good enough to stand out before it disappears over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon">event horizon</a> and into an employers black hole, see section @ref(rejection). Employer practices vary, but according to some estimates the person reading your CV will typically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend around <strong>7 seconds</strong> (or less!) deciding if your CV is interesting enough to shortlist and read in a bit more depth. This is a pessimistic view, see the discussion by Andrew Fennell for a more complete story <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fennell">Fennell 2022</a>)</span></li>
<li>Shortlist about <strong>20%</strong> of the all CVs they get sent <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fennell">Fennell 2022</a>)</span></li>
<li>Interview about <strong>2%</strong> of the candidates on their shortlist <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fennell">Fennell 2022</a>)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>So, the <em>first</em> thing your CV or résumé needs to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>catch attention so it ends up in the <em>lets read that a bit more pile</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having passed the 7 second test, the second thing your CV or résumé needs to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>persuade an employer to invite you to an interview</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can start with an employer-agnostic CV but you may need to come back and revisit the issues in this chapter once you have identified some target employers, so that you can customise and tailor your CV and written applications.</p>

<div id="dead" class="section level2" number="8.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> The CV is dead, long live the CV!</h2>
<p>Résumés and CV’s have reigned supreme in the kingdom of employment and recruitment for many years but their demise has often been predicted, see figure @ref(fig:longlive-fig).</p>

<p>While it is true that some employers don’t accept CVs or favour online application forms or digital profiles, it is still worth writing a CV because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your CV provides a record for you of relevant things you’ve done</li>
<li>Your CV enables you to get your story straight, <em>What’s your story, coding glory?</em> see section @ref(story) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-whatsthestory">Gallagher 1995</a>)</span></li>
<li>Your CV forces you to articulate who you are and what you want, see chapter @ref(exploring)</li>
<li>Some employers will still ask you for one, see section @ref(robotproof) and figure @ref(fig:longlive-fig)</li>
<li>Your CV helps you script and practice your “lines” for interviews, see chapter @ref(speaking)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if an employer never asks you for your CV, you’ll frequently want to use the <em>content</em> of your CV in applications and interviews. So this chapter looks at how you can debug your written applications, whatever the mechanism is for submitting them.</p>
<p>You can of course <em>augment</em> your CV with various public digital profiles such as LinkedIn, Github etc. A public digital profile can help employers find you, see section @ref(portfolio).</p>
<p><em>Wherever</em> you’re putting information about yourself for potential employers, on a CV, Résumé, LinkedIn profile the same principles apply. See the checklist in section @ref(checklist) and for specific advice on LinkedIn see:</p>

<p>Like writing software, the challenging part of writing a CV isn’t the <em>creation</em> but in the <em>debugging</em> and subsequent re-writing. Can you identify and fix the bugs before they are fatal?</p>
<!--## Debug their CV {#bugfeature} It's difficult to be objective about your own CV.-->
<div class="rmdcaution">
<p>(ref:codingcaution)</p>
<p>If you ask three people what they think of your CV, you will get three different and probably contradictory opinions. CV’s are very subjective and very personal. The advice in this chapter is based on common sense, experience and ongoing conversations with employers. What makes a good CV will depend on the personal preferences and prejudices of your readers. So, this chapter just describes some general debugging guidelines, rather than rigid rules.</p>
<p>It is good practice to <em>triangulate</em> responses from your readers. For example, if three different people point out the same bug in your CV you can be confident that it is a bug that needs fixing.</p>
</div>
<p>While referring to this guide, remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main purpose of your CV is to get an interview, not a job. Your CV should catch attention and provide talking points for an interview</li>
<li>Your CV will be assessed in seconds, rather than minutes so brevity really is key</li>
<li>Bullet points with verbs first (see section @ref(verbsfirst)) will:
<ul>
<li>allow your reader to quickly skim your CV because <a href="https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/how-people-read/">employers don’t actually read CVs</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-scanning">Richards 2019b</a>)</span></li>
<li>highlight your key activities</li>
<li>avoid long sections of flowery <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose">prose</a> which the reader will very probably skip anyway. Instead, you can use your beautiful prose on your covering letters or personal statements, see section @ref(we3qs)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You’re not trying to tell your <em>whole</em> life story from section @ref(story) but to distill the essentials into several short stories which can be summarised into a handful of bullets or sentences. Your CV should be punchy like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurb">blurb</a> or synopsis on the back of a novel, can you entice the reader into wanting to find out more (by inviting you to an interview)?</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.5</span> Write something, anything!</h2>
<p>Just as you can’t edit a blank page, you can’t debug an unwritten CV either, see figure @ref(fig:jodi-picoult-fig). Debugging and editing your CV can be time consuming but wherever criticism of your CV or résumé comes from, don’t take it personally - it is probably one of the first you have written.</p>

<p>It might help to think of first version of your CV as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle">alpha or beta version</a> that you continuously test, release and redeploy. If it was an iPhone, its a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)">first generation iPhone</a> - with many future iterations to come! There are many chances to debug and improve your CV during your study but before potential employers read it. The aim of this chapter is to help you improve your CV, whatever stage you are at. Employers often grumble about Computer Science graduates lacking good written communication skills. Written applications and CV’s are a common example of this. Here are some common bugs (or are they features?) to pay attention to on initial draughts of your CV:</p>
<!-- this repeats the checklist at the end and needs moving-->
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>EDUCATION</strong>: Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) degree classification clear? Have you mentioned things you are studying now, not just courses you have finished? See section @ref(mycved)</li>
<li><strong>STRUCTURE</strong>: Is the structure sensible? Is it in reverse chronological order? Most important (usually recent) things first? Not too many sections or anything missing? See section @ref(mycvst)</li>
<li><strong>NUMBERS</strong>: Have you <em>quantified</em> the context, action, results and evidence of the short stories on your CV where possible? See (<code>C.A.R.E.</code>) in section @ref(care)</li>
<li><strong>VERBS FIRST</strong>: Have you talked about what you have actually done using prominent <code>verbs</code>, rather than just what you think you know? Avoid long sections of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose">prose</a>, see section @ref(verbsfirst)</li>
<li><strong>STYLE</strong>: Does it look good, with a decent layout with appropriate use of <a href="https://latex4year1.netlify.app/">LaTeX</a> or Word or whatever? <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-latex4year1">Hull 2023</a>)</span> Are there any spelling mistakes, typos and grammar? Don’t just rely on a spellchecker, some errors will only be <del>spitted</del> spotted by a human reader see section @ref(spelling)</li>
<li><strong>LENGTH</strong>: Does it fit comfortably on (ideally) one page (for a Résumé) or two pages (for a CV)? See section @ref(length)</li>

<!-- this doesn't really fit here in structure, is there somewhere better? -->
<p>As Jonathan Black, director of the careers service at the University of Oxford points out in figure @ref(fig:black-vid), there are three key things you want to demonstrate in your CV:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>that you can take responsibility</li>
<li>that you achieve things</li>
<li>that you are good company (or at least a valued team member)</li>

<p>Quantifying and providing evidence for any claims you make will create a much more convincing CV. Numbers can transform meaningless assertions described in figure @ref(fig:black-vid) into meaningful evidence. So for example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Achieved excellent results</span></code></pre></div>

<p>So you worked in a team? <code>Worked</code> is vague. What was your role and contribution exactly? How long did the project last? How many people were on your team?

<div id="mycvpd" class="section level3" number="8.6.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.6.1</span> Your header</h3>
<p>The first thing in your CV is the header, a simple section giving your name, email, phone number and any links shown in the CV in figure @ref(fig:turinghead-fig) for Alan Turing. That’s it!</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/alan-turing-header.png" alt="(ref:captioncvheader)" width="98%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:turinghead-fig)(ref:captioncvheader)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captioncvheader) Keep the header of your CV simple like Alan’s example here. Just your name, email, phone number and any relevant links (e.g. <a href="https://enwp.org/Alan_Turing">enwp.org/Alan_Turing</a> here) are all you really need. You might also include a timestamp like <code>last updated 1954-06-07</code> and if you have a public digital profile, your header is a good place to put it, see section @ref(portfolio). Any additional information risks wasting valuable space and distracting your reader. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_(Unix)">Less is more</a>.</p>
<p>Your header doesn’t need to include any more information than your name, email, phone and any links. This means your birth date, marital status, photo<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and home address aren’t relevant. You don’t need to give multiple phone numbers or emails either, just one of each will do. If an employer wants to invite you to an interview, they’ll get in touch by email, phone (or possibly LinkedIn, github etc) so other contact details such as your postal address are an irrelevant distraction at this point. After your header I suggest you have about five sections that cover some or all of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>🎓 <code>Education</code>: the formal stuff, see section @ref(mycved)</li>
<li>💰 <code>Experience</code>: paid work, see section @ref(mycvex)</li>
<li>💪 <code>Projects</code>: personal, school, social, side or University projects see section @ref(mycvpj)</li>
<li>🏆 <code>Leadership and awards</code>: your trophy cabinet, see section @ref(prizes)</li>
<li>❓ <code>Optional</code>: but don’t call it that, see section @ref(misc)</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s look at each of these sections in turn:</p>

<p>Unless you have a <em>significant</em> amount of experience, the <code>Education</code> section of your CV should be the first “real” section, after the header. Your education section is important, see figure @ref(fig:blair-fig) so your description of it needs to strike a balance between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describing in enough detail what you’ve studied and any projects<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> you’ve completed at University as part of your <em>formal</em> education</li>
<li>Keeping it short and sweet by avoiding getting bogged down in tedious and irrelevant educational details that will be of little interest to your readers</li>

<p>(ref:captionblair) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair">Tony Blair</a>’s top three priorities as a new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom were <code>education, education and education</code>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tonyblair">T. Blair 2001</a>; <a href="#ref-blair">Coughlan 2007</a>)</span> Likewise, at this stage of your career, your education should be a top priority on your CV. Education should go first, unless you’ve got a <em>significant</em> amount of <code>experience</code>. As a graduate (or undergraduate) your education is the most recent, relevant and important thing about you so it should have top billing, see the discussion in figure @ref(fig:lopez-vid). This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License">GNU Free Documentation Licensed</a> (GFDL) portrait of Tony Blair in 2007 by the Polish Presidency on Wikimedia Commons <a href="https://w.wiki/64Kd">w.wiki/64Kd</a> has been adapted using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238">Wikipedia app</a></p>
<p>You’ve invested a significant amount of time and money in getting your degree. At this stage, your degree justifies a longer description than a rather terse one line <code>BSc Computer Science</code>. You’ll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>say <em>more</em> than <a href="Penelope_Tester.pdf">Pen Tester</a> and <a href="Rick_Urshion.pdf">Rick Urshion</a>, who haven’t said enough about their University education</li>
<li>say <em>less</em> than <a href="Mike_Rokernel.pdf">Mike Rokernel</a>, who has given <em>way</em> too much information on his degree.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to name every single module, course code with a mark for each. Neither do you need to give your result to FOUR or FIVE significant figures: <code>71.587%</code><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>. Two significant figures will do just fine: <code>72% (first class)</code>. You might like to pick out relevant modules, or the ones you enjoyed most. Employers like Google encourage applicants to emphasise courses on data structures and algorithms, but you’ll need to tailor your description to the role and be brief. On a one page Résumé, you’ll probably only have two or three lines to summarise some of the modules you’ve studied at University. 🎓</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.6.3</span> Your experience</h3>
<p>Experience is where you can talk about any paid or voluntary work experience you have. For paid work call it <code>EXPERIENCE</code> rather than <code>WORK EXPERIENCE</code> as the latter can imply work <em>shadowing</em>, see section @ref(areuexperienced). Work shadowing is valuable, but paid work is even better so you should make it clear if your experience was paid or not. Don’t discount the value of casual labour, such as working in retail or hospitality, these demonstrate your work ethic and ability to deal with customers, often under pressure. You are more than just a techie too, so anywhere you’ve worked in a team is experience worth mentioning, even if that team was just two people. Two people is still a team.</p>

<p>(ref:captionwhathaveudone) Are you experienced? What have you done outside of your formal academic education?

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.6.4</span> Your projects</h3>
<p>The <code>Projects</code> section of your CV is where you can describe all your other activities. Your projects will include activities that you haven’t already described in your <code>Education</code> or your paid <code>Experience</code> section such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>personal side projects, see section @ref(tinkering)</li>
<li>social responsibility projects, not neccesarily technical, see section @ref(volunteering)</li>
<li>open source projects, see section @ref(opensource)</li>
<li>entrepreneurial projects, your “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_job">side hustles</a>” (if you have any)</li>
<li>hackathons, olympiads and other competitive or collaborative events, see section @ref(tinkering)</li>
<li>University projects:
<ul>
<li>these sometimes fit better in your <code>Education</code> section, depending on how many non-Uni projects you have</li>
<li>If you are publishing a group project, you will need permission from <em>all</em> of your team to make the code public</li>
<li>Be <em>careful</em> publishing coursework. If someone copies your coursework, you will <strong>BOTH</strong> be guilty of academic malpractice because you’ve colluded in plagiarism.</li>
<li>… but final year (“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capstone_course">capstone</a>”) projects are great as these will tend to be unique, distinguishing you from everybody else in your year group</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Your projects will most likely be unpaid because paid work tends to fit better under the heading <code>experience</code>, see section @ref(mycvex). Perhaps you’ve completed some courses outside of your education such as a massive open online course (MOOC) or similar. Hackathons and competitions, fit well here too. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hafb">Fogarty 2015</a>)</span> You don’t <em>need</em> to have won any prizes or awards, although be sure to mention them if you have. Participating in hackathons and competitions clearly shows the reader that you enjoy learning new things. Demonstrating an appetite for new knowledge and skills will make your application stand out. If you’re looking for some inspiration for side projects, the <a href="https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x">codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x</a> repository is a good starting point. Building and creating new things is a great way to understand them, just ask <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> shown in figure @ref(fig:feynman-fig). What you cannot create you do not understand. Another great way to learn is to get involved with open source projects which we describe in section @ref(opensource).</p>

<p>Any longer projects you’ve done at University are worth mentioning. Your projects are important because they differentiate you from everyone else in your year group. Try to be <em>more</em> descriptive than this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>First year team project</span></code></pre></div>

<p>By themselves, those project names are pretty opaque. They are OK for giving the <em>context</em> of your story but don’t tell the reader anything about what <em>you</em> did or what the <em>software/hardware/project</em> did. What was the story (the context, action, result and evidence (<code>CARE</code>) we described in section @ref(care)) of those projects? How many people were in your team? How long did you collaborate for? What did you build? What was it called? What did it do? What roles and responsibilities did you have in the team? Was their conflict in the team? How did you resolve it? How did you motivate the free-riders in the team to contribute?

<p>It’s often better to describe what YOU did before you describe what the software, hardware or project did. Your reader is much more likely to be interested in the former than the latter. Let’s imagine you’ve developed a piece of software called <code>WidgetWasher</code>. You might describe it like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>WidgetWasher is a web service that washes widgets</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><a href="#cb18-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>It uses an HTTP API and secret keys</span>
<span id="cb18-3"><a href="#cb18-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Tested WidgetWasher on a range of different operating systems</span>
<span id="cb18-4"><a href="#cb18-4" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Collaborated with one other contributor over two days</span>
<span id="cb18-5"><a href="#cb18-5" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Designed and implemented an API</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Instead, you could reverse ↑↓ the order to change the emphasis like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Designed and implemented an API ↑</span>
<span id="cb19-2"><a href="#cb19-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Collaborated with one other contributor over two days ↑</span>
<span id="cb19-3"><a href="#cb19-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Tested WidgetWasher on a range of different operating systems</span>
<span id="cb19-4"><a href="#cb19-4" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Utilised an HTTP API and secret keys ↓</span>
<span id="cb19-5"><a href="#cb19-5" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Created a web service that washes widgets called WidgetWasher ↓</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The latter has all the same information, but by reversing the order, you’ve emphasised what <em>you</em> did, rather than what the software did. Much more interesting. 💪
<!-- need a section on 👑 Activities and leadership --></p>
</div>
<div id="prizes" class="section level3" number="8.6.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.6.5</span> Your leadership &amp; awards</h3>
<p>If you can demonstrate leadership, you may want to dedicate a whole separate section to it. Experience of tutoring or mentoring other students, can serve as a good example through peer-assisted study schemes (like <a href="https://www.peersupport.manchester.ac.uk/what-is-peer-support/what-is-pass/">PASS</a>) for example. Teaching is a different kind of leadership to running a small business or captaining a sports team, but it is leadership nonetheless. A <code>leadership</code> and/or <code>awards</code> section is also a good place to add any prizes you’ve won, see figure @ref(fig:trophy-fig)</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/trophy.jpeg" alt="(ref:captiontrophy)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:trophy-fig)(ref:captiontrophy)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captiontrophy) Have you won any prizes or trophies? If you have, make sure you describe <em>what</em> your prizes were awarded for and any ranking associated with them, as discussed in the text below. You’re not just blowing your own trumpet, but clearly demonstrating to your reader that <em>somebody else</em> (besides yourself) recognised and rewarded your achievements. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en">CC0 public domain</a> picture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a> holding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Champion_Clubs%27_Cup">European Champion Clubs’ Cup</a> in 1972 from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationaal_Archief">Nationaal Archief</a> on Wikimedia Commons <a href="https://w.wiki/6h5t">w.wiki/6h5t</a> adapted using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238">Wikipedia App</a> ⚽️</p>
<p>If you’ve been granted any interesting awards or honours be sure to mention them, because they provide evidence to the reader that a third party has endorsed you. <em>Other</em> people think you are good at something, and this says much more than <em>you</em> thinking you’re good at something. You’ll typically need a bit more than this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Awarded the Poppleton University scholarship for excellence</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Congratulations, but how many people were awarded that prize? How many applicants or entrants were there and what percentage were successful? Was it a regional, national or global award? How frequently is the award given? It is unlikely that your reader will have heard of the award unless it is widely known. You might talk about your ranking e.g.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Won third prize in the flibbertigibbet competition</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, congratulations, but third place out of how many?</p>
<ul>
<li><code>3/3</code>? Not so impressive</li>
<li><code>3/30</code>?</li>
<li><code>3/300</code>?</li>
<li><code>3/3000</code>? More impressive</li>
</ul>
<p>Numbers can speak louder than words, so if you’re going to mention awards, quantify<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> where you can so the reader can understand what the prize was for. You may well be intimately acquainted with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flibbertigibbet">flibbertigibbet</a> competition but your reader probably won’t of heard of it, so give some context.</p>
<p>Finally, your <code>awards</code> section might also include any courses you’ve done <em>outside</em> of the formal (compulsory) and university courses described in your <code>Education</code> section<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>. Extra skills and knowledge you’ve picked up from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">Massive Open Online Courses</a> (MOOCs) or any other credentials you’ve collected such as those described in sections @ref(mooc) and @ref(otherbadges), are worth mentioning. 🏆</p>
</div>
<div id="misc" class="section level3" number="8.6.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.6.6</span> Your optional extras</h3>
<p>If you have anything else you want to highlight besides your <code>Education</code>, <code>Experience</code>, <code>Projects</code>, <code>Leadership and Awards</code> you <em>may</em> still have room for one more optional section. Try to come up with a better names for this section than:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Miscellaneous</code></li>
<li><code>Extracurricular</code></li>
<li><code>Other highlights and activities</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These titles sound like dumping grounds for your leftovers. You might decide to have a dedicated <code>skills</code> or <code>personal statement</code> section but see section @ref(mycvsk) and @ref(bullshit).</p>
<p>You could opt to have a <code>hobbies and interests</code> section which can add a bit of colour to what can otherwise become quite a dull list of facts. However, it is debatable how many (if any) hobbies and interests you should list on your CV. For a one-pager you’re usually pushed for space and looking for things to edit <em>out</em> (rather than add in), so if you’re going to list hobbies, I’d stick to those that are relevant to the job or those that demonstrate particular transferrable or soft skills. Organising or participating in team sports is a good example of a relevant hobby as it provides evidence of your teamwork, commitment, reliability etc, see figure @ref(fig:quidditch-fig). Other collaborative activities outside of sport will also demonstrate your communication skills. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hobbies">Cheary 2021</a>)</span></p>

</div>
<p>(ref:captionquidditch) It is debatable which, if any, of your hobbies should go on your CV. You might get lucky and your interviewer(s) will share your esoteric passion for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(real-life_sport)">Quidditch</a> (say). <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-quidditch">Rowling 1997</a>)</span> However, such coincidences are unlikely so if you <em>do</em> list your hobbies and interests, think carefully about <em>WHY</em> you are mentioning them and <em>WHAT</em> skills, knowledge or experience you are trying to demonstrate to potential employers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyone_for_tennis%3F">Anyone for Quidditch</a> sketch by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a></p>
<p>The fact that you enjoy <code>swimming</code>, <code>reading</code>, <code>football</code>, <code>cooking</code> and <code>hiking</code> is vague and pretty boring, making it unlikely to be a factor in the decision to invite you to interview. There’s nothing <em>wrong</em> with these pastimes but there’s not much point mentioning them on your CV unless you have, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>coached a swimming team</li>
<li>trained as a mountain leader</li>
<li>organised, hosted and participated in a book club</li>
<li>won some awards for your hobby, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_belt_(martial_arts)">black belt</a> or chess championship for example</li>
<li>regularly participated in or organised competitive sports matches (for example)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, the <em>way</em> you have engaged with your hobbies demonstrates your communication and leadership skills. So in this context, your hobbies <em>are</em> worth talking about if you have any space left. However, if they are just hobbies that enable you to amuse yourself, you should probably leave them out as they are unlikely to be of interest to an employer. Sure, they add colour to your CV, but you’ve probably got more interesting and important things to say about who you are.</p>
<p>Of course, you <em>might</em> get lucky and your interviewer(s) could be intrigued by (or even share) your esoteric passion for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(real-life_sport)">Quidditch</a> (say), but you can’t rely on it. So, I reckon if you’re going to mention hobbies and interests at all then …</p>
<ul>
<li>pick the unusual hobbies that make you unique</li>
<li>describe the interests that add some colour and personality to your CV</li>
<li>be specific, e.g. <code>reading japanese novels from 20th century</code> might sound more interesting (and convincing) than just <code>reading</code></li>
<li>highlight any <code>actions</code> you’ve taken, see chapter @ref(actioning)</li>
</ul>
<p>… or just leave them out altogether. That option is up to you.❓</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.6.7</span> Show your C.A.R.E.</h3>
<p>You may be tempted to dedicate a whole section on your CV to <code>skills</code>, particularly the technical ones. Maybe it makes you feel good listing them all in one place like a stamp collection. If you’re going to have a <code>skills</code> section, keep it short. Why? Let’s imagine, that like <a href="Rick_Urshion.pdf">Rick Urshion</a>, you include Python in a long list of skills, with its own dedicated section. There are at least five problems with Rick’s not so skilful approach:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>❎ <strong>No <code>Context</code></strong> to give the reader an idea of where he’s developed or used his Python skills. Was it during his education, as a part of his work experience or his personal projects? We don’t know because he doesn’t say.<br />
</li>
<li>❎ <strong>No <code>Actions</code></strong> to demonstrate what he’s <em>done</em> with his Python skills. So Rick claims he knows Python. So what? What did he use them for? We don’t know because he hasn’t told us.</li>
<li>❎ <strong>No <code>Results</code></strong> given for what the outcome of using the skills was. Did he save his employers some money? Did he make something more efficient? Did he learn some methodology? We will never know.<br />
</li>
<li>❎ <strong>No <code>Evidence</code></strong> to support his claims. Perhaps he DOES have Python skills, perhaps he DOESN’T. Is he telling lies and peddling fake news (see section @ref(oversell))? It’s difficult to tell.</li>
<li>❎ <strong>No <code>C.A.R.E.</code></strong> There’s no story told for that skill, see figure @ref(fig:gallagher-fig). This makes for a very dull and boring read. Yawn. NEXT! 🥱</li>
</ol>

<p>(ref:captiongallagher) So <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(What%27s_the_Story)_Morning_Glory%3F">(What’s your Story) <del>Morning</del> Coding Glory?</a></em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-whatsthestory">Gallagher 1995</a>)</span> What is the <code>Context</code>, the <code>Actions</code>, the <code>Results</code> and the <code>Evidence</code> for the stories that you are trying to tell?

<p>So, this doesn’t mean Rick shouldn’t mention his Python skills. Where he can, he needs to give us the <code>C</code>ontext, <code>A</code>ction, <code>R</code>esult and <code>E</code>vidence (<code>C.A.R.E.</code>) of his story described in section @ref(care). This will make his Python story much more convincing and interesting to read. Showing a bit of <code>C.A.R.E.</code> will improve his chances of being invited to interview.</p>
<p>This applies to soft skills too, not just hard technical skills. It is often better to mention the context in which you’ve used the skills you mention on your CV. So, if you’re going to have a skills section:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep it short, no more than two or three lines on a one-page CV</li>
<li>stick to your strongest and most relevant skills that you are comfortable to answer questions on in your interview, rather than an exhaustive encyclopædic inventory</li>
<li>avoid vague metrics of skill like <code>beginner</code>, <code>intermediate</code> and <code>advanced</code> as these are very subjective and won’t help the reader much. You might under or over-estimate your skill level anyway. Some people choose to quantify coding skills with <code>years of experience</code> or the <code>lines of code</code> (LoC), but these still don’t tell the reader very much. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-linesofcode">Alpernas, Feldman, and Peleg 2020</a>)</span></li>
<li>avoid listing mass marketed office products of Microsoft (e.g. Word etc) as a skill, they are <em>not</em> generally very interesting skill because almost <em>everyone</em> has them. They won’t set you apart much from your competition, so don’t waste valuable space talking about office applications unless you’ve done something interesting with them, like some advanced integration with other software. Cloud services can be a slightly different matter, see section @ref(techie).</li>

<p>If you’re a computer scientist, you also have demonstrable <code>meta</code> skills like the ability to learn things quickly. You can also think logically and critically, reason, problem solve, analyse, generalise, decompose and abstract - often to tight deadlines. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking">computational thinking</a> skills are future-proof and will last longer than whatever technology happens to be fashionable right now. Employers are often more interested in these <code>meta</code> capabilities and your potential than in any specific technical skills you may or may not have.</p>

<p>(ref:captionworkcv) Does your CV need a little work? The truth is your CV is never finished, you will be continuously developing, debugging and releasing it throughout your life. It’s such a crucial document because it will determine if you are invited to interview. Any time you spend getting it right is a good investment.

<p>Whatever your typographical style is, portable document format (<code>*.pdf</code>) is the safest way to deliver it. It’s called <em>portable</em> for a reason. While Microsoft Word is fine for editing, it is difficult to ensure that a Word document doesn’t get mangled by transmission via the web, email or even Microsoft’s own products like Teams! PDF is much safer, you can be more confident that it will work well on a range of different operating systems and devices. Try opening a Word document on a range of different smartphones and tablets and you’ll see what I mean. It helps your reader if you can give your CV file a descriptive name, especially if it is being read by a human and not a robot. 🤖</p>

<p>It’s fine to author your CV in Microsoft Word, but you’ll want to save it as (or print to) PDF to make it more platform independent.

<div id="care" class="section level3" number="8.7.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.7.3</span> What’s your story, coding glory?</h3>
<p>One way to structure descriptions of items within each section of your CV is to use <strong>C</strong>ontext, <strong>A</strong>ction, <strong>R</strong>esult and <strong>E</strong>vidence (C.A.R.E.) to tell your stories. What’s your story, coding glory? <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-whatsthestory">Gallagher 1995</a>)</span> The <code>C.A.R.E.</code> method can also be useful for structuring answers to interview questions, especially if you get nervous. So for example, rather than just listing <code>Python</code> as a skill, you could tell the reader more about the context in which you’ve used python, what you actually did with it and what the result was. You really need to spell it out.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CONTEXT</strong>: So you’ve used <code>Python</code>, but in what context? As part of your education? For a personal project? As a volunteer? In a competition? All of the above?</li>
<li><strong>ACTION</strong>: What did you <em>do</em> with <code>Python</code>? Did you use some particular library? Did you integrate or model something? What verbs can you use to describe these actions, see chapter @ref(actioning)</li>
<li><strong>RESULT</strong>: What was the result and how can you measure it? You picked up some new skills? What was the impact? Perhaps you made something that was inefficient and awkward into something better, cheaper or faster? Some things are hard to measure but you should quantify results where you can.</li>
<li><strong>EVIDENCE</strong>: Where evidence exists, you should highlight it. That could be a quantification, for example describing a result in numbers (see <code>as measured by</code> below) or it might be certification described in chapter @ref(achieving). If you’re talking about software, point to a copy online if you can, see section @ref(portfolio). Nothing says “I can build software …” quite like “ … and here’s one I made earlier”.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to stick rigidly to the order C.A.R.E. as long as they appear somewhere. For example, recruiters at Google (see figure @ref(fig:lopez-vid)) advise candidates to describe their experience and projects using this simple pattern:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb22-1"><a href="#cb22-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Accomplished <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">X</span><span class="co">]</span>, as measured by <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Y</span><span class="co">]</span>, by doing <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Z</span><span class="co">]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Where <em>accomplished</em> is <code>Result</code>, <em>measured by</em> is <code>Evidence</code> and <em>doing</em> is the <code>Action</code>. So instead of just saying:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb23-1"><a href="#cb23-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Generated reports for end users</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You could say:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb24-1"><a href="#cb24-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Generated daily reconciliation report for team by automating workflow of 8 different tasks</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The latter is better because it is more specific, captures the result (<code>accomplishment</code>), by giving evidence (<code>8 different tasks</code>) and talks about the actions (the <code>doing</code> part). Choose the verbs you use carefully, see chapter @ref(actioning) for examples.</p>

<p>How long should your CV be? Many people start with a two page CV, which is a sensible starting point shown in figure @ref(fig:oneortwopager-vid). It is also advisable to <a href="https://www.cv-library.co.uk/career-advice/cv/how-long-cv-be/">create a one page Résumé</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-howlong">David 2017</a>)</span></p>

<p>At this stage in your career you <em>should</em> be able to fit everything on to one page. However, it can be challenging and time consuming squeezing it all on, see figure @ref(fig:shorterletter-fig).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p>(ref:captionshorterletter) I would have written a shorter <del>letter</del>, <del>CV</del>, Résumé but I did not have the time. This quote (or meme) is frequently attributed to Blaise Pascale’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettres_provinciales">Lettres provinciales</a></em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-shorterletter">O’Toole 2012</a>)</span>.

<p>It takes more time to write less. Writing a one page résumé is a valuable exercise, because it forces you to distill and edit out any filler or fluff, which you sometimes find on two page undergraduate or graduate CVs. It is much better to have a strong one-page résumé than a weaker two-page CV that is padded out with filler to make up the space, as described in the video in figure @ref(fig:oneortwopager-vid). Adding more features (pages and content) to your CV doesn’t necessarily make it better. Sometimes adding more features to your CV will make it worse, as shown in figure @ref(fig:morefeatures-fig).</p>

<p>(ref:captionmorefeatures) If it ain’t broke it doesn’t have enough features yet. Adding more features to software doesn’t necessarily make it better. Likewise, adding more pages and content to your CV or résumé won’t always improve it. It’s often better to be precise and concise, rather than bloated and potentially more buggy. <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/an-engineering-state-of-mind/">An engineering state of mind</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a>, with help from Dilbert cartoonist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams">Scott Adams</a></p>
<p>If you’re struggling to fit all the information onto a one page résumé, revisit each section and item carefully:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there anything you can cut?</li>
<li>Can you save a wasteful word here or a lazy line there?</li>
<li>Check for any spurious line breaks, like a line with just one or two words on it, because every pixel counts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your two page CV is still a good store of stuff you might want to add to customised one-page résumés. If you find yourself cutting important stuff, you could list it somewhere else (like LinkedIn etc, see section @ref(portfolio)) and link to it from your CV.</p>
</div>
<div id="verbsfirst" class="section level3" number="8.7.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.7.5</span> Verbs first: lead with your actions</h3>
<p>A simple but effective technique for emphasising what you have done, rather than just what you know, is to start the description of it with a verb. Employers don’t just want to know what you know, but what you have actually done. So, for example, instead of saying e.g.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb25-1"><a href="#cb25-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>In my second year CS29328 software engineering module I used Java, Eclipse and JUnit to test and build an open source Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>you could say:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb26"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb26-1"><a href="#cb26-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Built and tested a large open-source codebase using Eclipse, Ant, JUnit and Jenkins”</span></code></pre></div>
<p>followed by:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb27"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb27-1"><a href="#cb27-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Added and deployed new features to a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) in Java</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The latter examples get to the point much quicker and avoid the problem of using <code>I, me, my...</code> too much which can sound self-centred and egotistical. Although your CV is all about you so it is natural to have a few personal pronouns in there, too many can look clumsy and give the wrong impression. Choose the verbs you use carefully, see chapter @ref(actioning) for examples.</p>
</div>
<div id="links" class="section level3" number="8.7.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.7.6</span> Your links</h3>
<p>Augmenting your CV with web links (hyperlinks) can add important context, results and evidence to your stories, without adding too many words or taking up valuable space. An example using LinkedIn is shown in figure @ref(fig:lovelace-fig).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/lovelace-linkedin.png" alt="(ref:captionlovelace)" width="98%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:lovelace-fig)(ref:captionlovelace)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionlovelace) Adding links is a good way to augment your CV. If you’re adding LinkedIn, make sure you <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/topics/6042/6054/87">customise your public profile URL</a>, (the <code>.../in/handle</code>) to remove the default randomly generated alphanumeric string at the end, like the <code>038b37</code> example here. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-customlinkedin">Hoffman 2020</a>)</span> You can also remove any ugly <code>http</code>, colons <code>::</code>, forward slashes <code>//</code>, <code>www</code> and trailing <code>/</code> in URLs which are distracting noise. Just make sure links are clickable in the pdf, don’t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404">404</a> if they are followed and work when printed on paper too. Neither do you need to waste valuable space telling people what the link is, like in the first example, the domain name already tells you that it is a LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p>Links can provide <code>Context</code>, (Action), <code>Result</code> and <code>Evidence</code> (see <code>C.A.R.E.</code> in section @ref(care)) by quantifying and substantiating any claims that you make. Links demonstrate what you’ve done and which communities you’ve been a part of. For example, you might says things like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb28-1"><a href="#cb28-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Built a thing called example.com</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This shows that the thing you built was substantial enough to have its own domain. It also says “I like building things. Look at this thing I built just for fun, its really cool”. Or you might say:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb29"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb29-1"><a href="#cb29-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Elected as a representative for hacksoc.com</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The link shows you were part of a community: “I was part a bigger thing…” you might not have heard about but you can find out about here. You might also say:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb30-1"><a href="#cb30-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Competed at hack-to-the-future.com part III</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Reading between the lines: “I really enjoy learning from other people by going to hackathons and competitions”</p>
<p>… and so on. So links are crucial features of your CV and an interested reader <em>may</em> even follow them. Treat links with respect and they will support your goals and help your readers. Invest some time thinking about how you word the link text, and how they would be understood out of context. Make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>your hyperlinks are <a href="https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/links/">readable and descriptive</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-readable">Richards 2019a</a>)</span><br />
</li>
<li>your hyperlinks are clickable in the PDF. Don’t expect your reader to cut and paste (or even type) URLs, they are too busy. If they are clickable, people are much more likely to follow them</li>
<li>your hyperlinks are paper-proof: links with opaque titles like “<a href="linkedin.com/in/duncanhull">My LinkedIn</a>”, “<a href="https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere.html">click here</a>”, and “<a href="https://github.com/dullhunk">My Projects on Github</a>” won’t work well on printed paper unless you explicitly spell the URL out like this:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/duncanhull">linkedin.com/in/duncanhull</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dullhunk">github.com/dullhunk</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Some people still print CV’s so it is worth making links work on paper as well as online, see <a href="https://bbc.in/3zXv6zr">to print or not to print — a CV, that is</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-printcv">Garone 2014</a>)</span></p>
<p>Besides LinkedIn you could include public profiles from <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile">github.com</a>, <a href="https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021734632-Update-your-profile-and-username">devpost.com</a>, <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard">hackerrank.com</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@rhamedy/contribution-debt-why-how-to-contribute-to-stack-overflow-a69d4bd50d0c">stackoverflow</a>, see section @ref(portfolio) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stackoverflow">Hamedy 2019</a>)</span>. You can also link to personal projects, any articles you’ve published or your blog if you have one. Obviously, you need to be careful about what you link to and what employers can find out about you online. They <em>will</em> Google you. So keep it professional and, as we discussed in a section @ref(signposts3), if you’re not already, be wary of social media.</p>
<div class="rmdnote">
<p>(ref:codingcomment)</p>
<p>LinkedIn is much more than a tool for publishing your CV or résumé because it also allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>search and apply for jobs</li>
<li>create a digital portfolio that is publicly available<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></li>
<li>connect with professionals, think social media for jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter @ref(finding) looks at job searching in more detail but for now just note the similarities and differences between LinkedIn, CVs and résumés outlined in table @ref(tab:linkedintable). Some of these differences also apply to other places online where you might augment your CV with extra information such as github, devpost and others mentioned in section @ref(links) and @ref(portfolio).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.7.8</span> Spellchecking</h3>
<p>Bots, grammar checkers, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and spell checkers can help improve your written applications and CV. However, you can’t rely on machines and their algorithms completely. The résumé robots described in section @ref(robotproof) will just encode the biases and prejudices of whoever wrote their algorithms, see section @ref(machines). Basic spellcheckers can’t be relied on completely either, as shown in the poem below:</p>
<pre><code>
Eye halve a spelling checker
It came with my pea sea
It plainly marques four my revue
Miss steaks eye kin knot sea

Eye strike a key and type a word
And weight for it to say
Weather eye am wrong oar write
It shows me strait a weigh

As soon as a mist ache is maid
It nose bee fore two long
And eye can put the error rite
Its rare lea ever wrong

Eye have run this poem threw it
I am shore your pleased two no
Its letter perfect awl the weigh
My chequer told me sew

<p>While automation can help improve your writing, ultimately there is no substitute for people (you know: actual <em>humans</em>) reading your CV, and the more people that read it the better. This could be potential employers, your critical friends shown in figure @ref(fig:wonderfuldarling-fig) or just reading it <strong>out loud</strong> to yourself described in section @ref(dogfooding).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.7.9</span> Your references</h3>
<p>You might be tempted to put your referees details on your résumé. Don’t bother because;</p>
<ul>
<li>references waste valuable space. You can say much more interesting things about yourself than who you referees are</li>
<li>references aren’t needed in the early stages of a job application anyway. Employers typically ask for your referees <em>much</em> later, when you’ve been offered or are about to be offered the job</li>
<li>references disclose personal information. Do you really want to be giving personal details out to anyone that reads your CV? It could easily be misused.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not even worth saying <code>references available on request</code> - that just wastes space as well and is implied information on every CV anyway.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.9</span> Checklist: Big Bad Bugs</h2>
<p>Here is a quick check-list for debugging your CV before you send it off to an employer:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>✅ Does it fit comfortably on exactly one page (résumé) or two pages (CV)? Definitely not one-and-a-half pages or more than two? See section @ref(length) Does the style look good? Is it easy on the eye? Is there adequate whitespace, not too much (gappy) or too little (cramped)? See section @ref(pdf)</li>
<li>✅ Have you used past tense consistently e.g. <code>developed</code> not <code>develop</code>, <code>collaborated</code> not <code>collaborate</code></li>
<li>✅ Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) overall degree classification clear? See section @ref(mycved)</li>
<li>✅ Have you eaten your own dogfood (woof), see section @ref(dogfooding)? Is <em>everything</em> relevant? e.g. no swimming certificates from ten years ago?</li>
<li>✅ Have you spell-checked using both automatic and manual (proof-reading) techniques? See section @ref(spelling).</li>
<li>✅ Have you got a second opinion from a “résumé robot”? Is it robot proof? See section @ref(robotproof) 🤖</li>
<li>✅ Have you shown you <code>C.A.R.E</code>? Are the <code>Contexts</code>, <code>Actions</code>, <code>Results</code> and <code>Evidence</code> described in section @ref(mycvsk) clear? Have you added <code>context</code> using relevant hyperlinks that an interested reader can click on? See section @ref(links)</li>
<li>✅ Is it in reverse chronological order with the most recent things <strong>first</strong>? Can your timeline be easily followed, with all dates clearly aligned for easy reading? See <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/Neil_Pointer.pdf">Neil Pointer</a> as an example with a clear timeline using right-aligned dates.</li>
<li>✅ Have you avoided using too many personal pronouns? <code>I, me, my ...</code> everywhere? See section @ref(verbsfirst)</li>
<li>✅ Have you made it clear what you have actually done using <strong>prominent</strong> <code>verbs</code>? See chapter @ref(actioning)</li>
<li>✅ Have you given sufficient information on your education without going into too much detail? Have you mentioned courses you are studying now (<em>and</em> next semester)? See section @ref(mycved)</li>
<li>✅ Have you <strong>quantified</strong> and evidenced the claims you have made where you can? See section @ref(mycvst)</li>
<li>✅ Is it balanced, including both technical and non-technical (softer) skills? See section @ref(casual)</li>
<li>✅ Does it have a good, clear structure? Not too many headings, around five sections for a one-pager see section @ref(mycvpd)?</li>
<li>✅ Have you clearly distinguished between paid, unpaid and voluntary <code>experience</code>? Have you done the same for your <code>projects</code>, see section @ref(mycvpj)? Have you included <em>all</em> of the relevant experience that you can fit on including casual work, see section @ref(casual)?</li>
<li>✅ Has your CV been reviewed by other people? Do a CV swap with a critical friend (see figure @ref(fig:wonderfuldarling-fig)) and score each others CV’s using <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/CV-rubric.pdf">this rubric</a>. This is a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a>. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law">Linus’s law</a> “given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Raymond1999">Raymond 1999</a>)</span> so the more people who give you feedback the better</li>
<li>✅ Have you reviewed other people’s CV’s? This will put you in the shoes of an employer or recruiter, thereby helping you to write a better CV yourself. See the examples in chapter @ref(hacking). Who would <em>you</em> want to interview and why?</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.10</span> Covering letters &amp; personal statements</h2>
<p>Applications and CV’s are often accompanied by covering letters or include some kind of personal statement or summary. They are your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">elevator pitch</a> shown in figure @ref(fig:elevator-fig). Whereas a lot of your CV is essentially a bulleted list of facts, numbers and evidence, a covering letter or personal statement gives you a chance to <em>really</em> demonstrate your fluent written communication skills in clear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose">prose</a>. If you’re going to include a <code>personal statement</code> or <code>profile</code> on your CV keep it short, unlike <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/mike_rokernel.pdf">Mike Rokernel</a> who waffles on for <em>ages</em> (yawn) without actually providing any evidence for his assertions. This kind of information usually fits better in your covering letter anyway, because there isn’t much space for it on a CV.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/elevator-pitch.jpeg" alt="(ref:captionelevator)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:elevator-fig)(ref:captionelevator)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionelevator) Covering letters and personal statements are your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">elevator pitch</a>. Whatever floor you’re destined for, your pitch should summarise why you’re applying and what you have to offer, in a way that persuades the reader (or listener) that they should invite you to interview, before they get out of your metaphorical elevator.

<p>Let’s say you’re applying for a widget engineering position at the world famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget">widgets</a>: <code>widget.com</code>. There are three things you need to convey in the following order:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Why them?</strong> Why are you applying to <code>widget.com</code></li>
<li><strong>Why that role?</strong> Employees of <code>widget.com</code> have many different roles and responsibilities but what is it about being a junior <code>widget engineer</code> or trainee <code>widget scientist</code> (say) that attracts you?</li>
<li><strong>Why you?</strong> Why should <code>widget.com</code> employ you? What skills and experience make you stand out from all the other hopeful widgeteers? What are your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_selling_proposition">Unique Selling Points</a> (USPs)? Say why <em>you</em> would be good for <em>them</em> (<strong>not</strong> why widget.com would be good for you and your career).</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.10.1</span> Does anyone actually READ covering letters?</h3>
<p>Some employers will read your covering letter very carefully, others less so. It is not always clear which employers will bother and which won’t.</p>
<p>Even if <em>nobody</em> reads your covering letter, it is still worth writing one because formulating answers to the three basic questions in section @ref(we3qs) will force you to rehearse standard interview questions.</p>
<p>You can think of your covering letter as writing and rehearsing some of the lines of your elevator pitch shown in figure @ref(fig:elevator-fig).</p>
</div>
<div id="bullshit" class="section level3" number="8.10.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.10.2</span> Embedding a personal statement</h3>
<p>You might be tempted to embed a short summary or <code>personal statement</code> section at the top of your CV after your header. If you’re thinking about doing this, keep it short or just leave it out altogether. Why? Here’s an example of how <em>not</em> to do it from <strong>Sir Professor Don Malaka</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society">FRS</a> who holds the Endowed Chair of Rhetoric at the <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/academic/laurie">University of Poppleton</a>:</p>
<div class="rmdnote">
<p><code>I have a proven track record of delivering excellent teaching and outstanding learning experiences for all of my students, whatever their background. I am also a committed and diligent leader who can deliver large and ambitious projects on time and to budget. I am also capable of leading cross-disclipinary teams of colleagues towards excellent and innovative results that align closely with strategic educational objectives.</code></p>
</div>
<p>Are you persuaded by Professor Malakas personal statement? I <em>hope</em> you are not convinced because it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit">smells of bullshit</a>, see figure @ref(fig:bullshit-fig). One of the reasons the statement smells dodgy is because it makes lots of assertions without providing any actual evidence. Is Professor Hotair trying to persuade us to disregard the truth? Without evidence, it is hard to tell which of their assertions are true or false, so the whole statement risks being ignored as bullshit or lies. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-onbullshit">Frankfurt 2005</a>)</span></p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/on-bullshit.jpeg" alt="(ref:captionbullshit)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:bullshit-fig)(ref:captionbullshit)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionbullshit) Yes, your CV is trying to persuade the reader to invite you to an interview. However, being persuasive doesn’t mean you have to try and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit">bullshit</a> your reader by exaggerating your achievements or telling lies. People who have to read your CV will probably be trawling through <em>hundreds</em> of others too. This means your readers will have <em>highly trained and sensitive</em> bullshit detectors, so you should avoid wasting their valuable time by shovelling even more bullshit onto their overloaded plates. Fair use image of the cover of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Frankfurt">Harry G. Frankfurt</a>’s best selling little book <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit">On Bullshit</a></em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-onbullshit">Frankfurt 2005</a>)</span> via Wikimedia Commons <a href="https://w.wiki/6Bnu">w.wiki/6Bnu</a> adapted using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238">Wikipedia app</a></p>
<p>On a one page CV, you rarely have space to include any of this kind of hot air anyway. High level statements usually fit better on a covering letter see section @ref(we3qs). A shorter, less <em>bullshitty</em> personal statement from a student is shown below:</p>
<div class="rmdnote">
<p><code>Hello, my name is Mike Rokernel. I am a second year student in Computer Science at the University of Poppleton looking for an industrial placement in software engineering</code></p>
</div>
<p>Is this better? Personally, I think you should only include a personal statement on your CV if you’ve got space to do so because you’ll often just repeat facts from your CV anyway, like Mike’s example above. Save the beautiful persuasive rhetorical prose for your covering letters and make reference to key facts on your CV. There are usually much more interesting and appetising things you can say about yourself on your CV. 💩</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.11</span> Debugging summary</h2>
<p>(ref:tldr)</p>
<p>Your future is bright, your future needs debugging. Debugging your future will help you test future. Testing your future will help you to start coding your future.</p>
<p>In this chapter we have looked at how to debug your future, with a particular focus on your CV (or résumé) and any supporting written communication. If you fix the bugs we’ve described here, before an employer sees your CV, you’ll stand a <em>much</em> better chance of getting an interview. The checklist in section @ref(checklist) is a good place to start debugging your CV.</p>
<!--https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1570060516839641092-->
<p><em>Some</em> of the strategies you apply to debugging your <em>actual</em> code, can also be applied to debugging your future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspect, don’t squash bugs, take time to reflect (see section @ref(reflecting)) and <em>understand</em> any bugs you find in your future <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pocketdebugging">Evans 2022</a>)</span></li>
<li>Being stuck is temporary, see section @ref(nevergiveup)</li>
<li>Check your assumptions, especially if debugging the <code>content</code> bugs described in section @ref(ilo7) makes you anxious or depressed, see chapter @ref(nurturing)</li>
<li>Don’t go it alone, grow your network, see section @ref(weakties)</li>
<li>Build your debugging toolkit by identifying your strengths and weaknesses, see chapter @ref(exploring)</li>
</ul>

<p>Debugging your future can be an enjoyable adventure! Debugging your future is Coding your future.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Hacking your future</h1>
<p>It’s all too easy to overlook mistakes in your own writing because its difficult to be both an <em>author</em> and an <em>editor</em> of the same text. That’s true of any written communication such as a covering letter, personal statement, email, essay or any message that you write. Mistakes are particularly common in CVs (or résumés) because they are so personal. You can spend <em>hours</em> carefully polishing the words and the formatting but not see a fatal error at the top of page one. Hacking<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> other people’s CV’s will help you debug and improve your own. You may need to use ingenious hacks like the temporary fix to the bridge in figure @ref(fig:kludge-fig). Fixing other peoples bridges will help you improve your own bridge, see section @ref(parti). You’ll build better bridges to more interesting and ambitious destinations.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Hacking their futures</h2>
<p>Hacking other people’s code is a good way to learn how to code. Hacking other people’s CV’s is a good way to learn how to write better CVs too. The dogfooding technique described in section @ref(dogfooding) is a useful hack which you can use by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Eating your <em>own</em> dogfood by reading your own written work ALOUD <!--self assess using the rubric--></li>
<li>Eating <em>somebody elses</em> dogfood by:

<li>Hacking a friends or peers CV by swapping with them and giving them constructive feedback</li>
<li>Hacking the fictitious CVs below by ranking them against a job advert in section @ref(cooltech). Who would you want to interview and why?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Eating your own dogfood again, re-reading and re-editing repeatedly</li>
<li>Persuade someone else to eat your dogfood - get feedback from as many people (and bots see section @ref(robotproof)) as you can</li>
</ol>
<p>So, here are some fictitious CVs for you to hack, from students of Computer Science. They are based on CVs I’ve seen, warts and all, with personal information removed and anonymised.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">10</span> Actioning your future</h1>
<p>Employers are often more interested in what you have <em>done</em>, rather than what you just <em>know</em>. Your actions are a key part of your story we discussed in section @ref(care). A simple technique for emphasising the <code>action</code> in your stories is to lead descriptions of your projects, education and experience with carefully chosen <code>verbs</code>, see section @ref(verbsfirst) for examples.</p>
<div id="impact" class="section level2" number="10.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Your actions define your impact</h2>
<p>Your actions define your impact, see figure @ref(fig:action-fig). What stories you can tell of your actions to date? What verbs best describe how you achieved a result or had an impact? What was the context, action, result and evidence (CARE) we discussed in section @ref(care) of each (short) story?</p>

<p>By leading with verbs you will highlight what you have <em>actually done</em> and how you did it, rather than what you know. It also helps you cut down on repetitive personal pronouns: <code>I</code>, <code>me</code>, <code>my</code> etc. See the verbs first section @ref(verbsfirst) of chapter @ref(debugging) <em>debugging your future</em>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Job search strategies</h2>
<p>Before we look at where to look for jobs, we need to discuss what to look for. Let’s imagine there is a handy AI-powered function in python called <code>find_jobs()</code> which knows <em>everything</em> about:</p>
<ul>
<li>all the jobs available, regardless of where they are advertised, including hidden ones (see Jonathan’s story of finding hidden jobs in chapter @ref(jonathan))</li>
<li>all of your skills, knowledge, values and ambitions</li>
<li>every employer in the world, their services, products and values</li>
<li>everyone in your social and professional networks, right from first degree connections through to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">sixth degree connections</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bacon">Bacon 1994</a>)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Such a function doesn’t really exist yet, but let’s pretend that it does to illustrate some points about job searching. If you were to run the function with no arguments…</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/6f3a98ca6ae2cdcb611f8b4838fe25df.js"></script>
<p>…you will be completely overwhelmed with the results. It can be bewildering knowing where to start your job search, because the possibilities are endless. Your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_space">search space</a> is huge.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we can break it down, but there are many parameters and variables in your search that you need to think about. Here are some basic strategies to help you start to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decompose</a> the complex problem of job hunting into smaller, more manageable problems you can start to tackle. We’ve already mentioned some:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>👨‍🔬 search by role, see section @ref(by-role)</li>
<li>📊 search by sector, see section @ref(by-sector)</li>
<li>💪 search by skills, see section @ref(by-skills)</li>
<li>🌍 search by location, see section @ref(by-location)</li>
<li>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 search by network, see section @ref(weakties)</li>
<li>💰 search by salary, see section @ref(by-salary)</li>
<li>🏋️ search by size, see section @ref(by-size)</li>
<li>❤️ search by values, see section @ref(by-values)</li>
<li>🕰 search by timing, see section @ref(by-time)</li>
<li>⚖️ search by quantity, see section @ref(by-quantity)</li>
</ol>
<p>Each strategy has is own strengths and weaknesses, so you’ll probably want to combine more than one and experiment with different strategies as your search progresses over time. No doubt, you’ll have some extra strategies of your own, this is not meant to be an exhaustive list, just a starting point:</p>
<div id="by-role" class="section level3" number="11.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.2.1</span> Search by role</h3>
<p>There are many different roles that studying computing gives you access to besides software engineering. So one strategy is to research the roles described in section @ref(otheroles), focus on some you like the sound of and then apply for those kinds of roles. Let’s say you are interested in <code>software engineering</code>. This is a strategy that will help you narrow down a huge number of jobs into something more manageable. For example:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/c13ddb4dbd5c43220cd35caa5d1f40c7.js"></script>
<p>The list of roles in section @ref(otheroles) will give you a flavour of some roles to think about, beyond software engineering.</p>
</div>
<div id="by-sector" class="section level3" number="11.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.2.2</span> Search by sector</h3>
<p>Computing is found in every sector of business and society. This means you won’t just find computing jobs in the technology sector. Although the lines between some sectors are becoming increasingly blurred, you can still narrow down your options by picking a sector you are interested in and pursuing that. For example:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/ecc64065d98a45b54ed178f370af6abf.js"></script>
<p>Like many graduate employment guides, the Guardian 300 guide (see section @ref(studentjobs)) has good overview of different sectors by breaking down employers by sectors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consulting</li>
<li>Public sector</li>
<li>Finance</li>
</ul>
<p>Picking a sector can help you get started, by narrowing what might otherwise be a massive search space. The sector(s) you choose will also determine the kind of salary you can expect, see section @ref(by-salary).</p>
<p>I’ve got the brains, you’ve got the looks, let’s make lots of money. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-letsmakelotsofmoney">Tennant and Lowe 1986</a>)</span></p>
</div>
<div id="by-skills" class="section level3" number="11.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.2.3</span> Search by skills</h3>
<p>Is there a specific skill you have that you enjoy using, or a technology you think has a promising future? You could use this as a way to find jobs, for example:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/61bf8c20b4eb2da9a168ebb29b7026fd.js"></script>
<p>Picking a specific technology can sometimes help you narrow down the options, for example by using these keywords in your search.</p>
</div>
<div id="by-location" class="section level3" number="11.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.2.4</span> Search by location</h3>
<p>If you were an estate agent, <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-location">Allsopp and Spencer 2000</a>)</span> you might argue that the three most important parameters of your job search are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Location</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Location</li>
</ol>
<p>So pick a location. Manchester? London? Paris? Berlin? New York? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">Silly Valley</a>? The location(s) you choose will determine the options that are available:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/5004cbf5fc337fb8e7357e62c50d15eb.js"></script>
<p>… and so on. So locations can help you define (and potentially reduce) your search space. For example, if you’re looking in Manchester, you can get started at <a href="https://git.io/manc">git.io/manc</a>. Picking a location can also help you identify networking opportunities for hidden, un-advertised vacancies and making speculative applications, described in section @ref(speculative). You could find out about employers by attending free <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> or <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/">eventbrite.com</a> events in your chosen location. See section @ref(jonetwork) of Jonathan’s story in chapter @ref(jonathan). Since its a big subject, there’s more information on searching by location in chapter @ref(moving).</p>
</div>
<div id="weakties" class="section level3" number="11.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.2.5</span> Search by network</h3>
<p>The people in your network can help you find work. <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it%27s_not_what_you_know_but_who_you_know">It’s not what you know, its who you know</a></em>, or so the cliché goes. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-newfads">Spearpoint et al. 1992</a>)</span> The bigger your network, the more opportunities you’ll know about. So a really basic strategy for finding jobs is using your networks. Remember, our <code>find_jobs</code> does just know what you know, it also knows who is in your professional <code>network</code> and the employers <em>they</em> know about, so we could ask it to find opportunities in your professional and social networks:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/c2e05b55e55c285de8525a6952731f30.js"></script>
<p>Your close network probably won’t change that much, the friends and family you trust and rely on. Its important to recognise the importance of more casual acquaintances, or what sociologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter">Mark Granovetter</a> calls “weak ties”. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-granovetter">Granovetter 1973</a>)</span></p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionbumped) It’s not what you know, its who you know: Networking and personal contacts can be more useful than just knowledge and skills alone, when seeking employment. Networking is an essential part of any job search, your networks can help you now and in the future. One of the things looked at in this chapter is how to build and use your networks to help find the job you’re after. The simplest networking technique is bumping into people, but you need create opportunities for that to happen. Bumped into sketch by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a></p>
<p>Weak ties are people you don’t know as well, but are important for a range of reasons. Research has shown that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-why-your-weak-tie-friendships-may-mean-more-than-you-think">building networks of weak ties is good for your mental health and can give you an edge in job hunting</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-weakties">Leslie 2020</a>)</span> Granovetter showed that many job opportunities came through weak ties, rather than strong ones. This is true not just of jobs early on in your career (like now) but also later too. So it is in your interests to continually foster weak connections and be open to serendipitous meetings where you bump into people, as in Figure @ref(fig:bumped-fig). “Bumping into” here, could mean either physical or virtual.</p>

<div id="by-salary" class="section level3" number="11.2.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.2.6</span> Search by salary</h3>
<p>You can also define your search space by salary:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/28c308ee12c067b95dd724eabfc9e291.js"></script>
<p>Setting a minimum salary will include or exclude certain employers from your search. To do this realistically, you need to know how much you are worth, see section @ref(undersell) and figure @ref(fig:salaries-fig) for some places to start.</p>

Note that these are <em>graduate</em> salaries, not internship or placement salaries which tend to be lower. Also note that “top” employers is a highly subjective judgement, lots of good smaller employers don’t feature in this data and they typically pay less than the large multinational employers dominating this sample. The averages also hide significant variations by sector and location, see the salary resources in section @ref(undersell)</p>

<div id="by-size" class="section level3" number="11.2.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.2.7</span> Search by size</h3>
<p>Do you see yourself working for a large multi-national corporation or a bedroom startup? Perhaps you prefer something in-between? There’s advantages and disadvantages to each, but like all our other parameters, picking an organisation size can help you get started. In some cases, size will also define the <code>type</code> or organisation, for example:</p>

<p>Likewise, if you know you want to work for a multi-national, that gives you a list of employers you can target. Picking a size, can help you identify employers you would like to work for. Table @ref(tab:shortcuts) summarises some of the when and where some employers typically advertise.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.2.8</span> Search by values</h3>
<p>Besides the mundane importance of balancing the books, what does a given employer actually value? How do an employers values match your own, the <code>values_match</code> below? Reasonably or not at all? How much of your soul do you need to sell? All of it, or just some of it? This a difficult question to compute, see section @ref(soul), but let’s imagine we can:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/015a1182225f13c9307538468620ceb9.js"></script>
<p>An employers <code>values</code> are usually reflected in its organisational <code>culture</code>. What is the employers culture like? What sort of structure would you fit into, see figure @ref(fig:pyramid-fig)? Would you enjoy working there and would you felt like you belonged? How can you actually find this out? Do you need to sell your soul? If you’re struggling with these questions, you may need to do some more soul searching, see section @ref(soul) and chapter @ref(exploring). Talk to employees too, this is why networking is important, see section @ref(weakties).</p>

</div>
<div id="by-time" class="section level3" number="11.2.9">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.2.9</span> Search by timing</h3>
<p>For graduates and undergraduates, the time of year you are looking can determine what jobs you can look for. At the beginning of the academic year in September you might target large multinational organisations. If you’re not successful, you could switch to smaller employers later in the academic year. For example “It’s October, so I’m applying to large employers” or:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/83030d66f53da3d664f6cd3ed7746a36.js"></script>
<p>Armed with knowledge of <em>when</em> to apply you can start to target employers. Timing is important because in some cases it will determine the <code>type</code> of organisation you apply to.</p>
</div>
<div id="by-quantity" class="section level3" number="11.2.10">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.2.10</span> Search by quantity</h3>
<p>Should you optimise the <em>quantity</em> of your applications or the <em>quality</em>, see figure @ref(fig:blunderbuss-fig)?</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p class="caption">

</div>
<p>(ref:captionblunderbuss) As you target employers, what will your strategy be? At one extreme you could optimise the <em>quantity</em> of your applications, aiming to do as many as you can. This is shown in the left of the picture by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunderbuss">blunderbuss</a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattergun">scattergun</a>) strategy. You make <em>lots</em> of applications but don’t target or tailor them much in the hope that <em>some</em> will hit the target if you point your weapon (that’s your CV) in approximately the general direction of your target employer. At the other extreme you could optimise the <em>quality</em> of your applications by spending more time researching the employer and carefully aiming your shots like a sniper would, in the right of the figure. Which strategy is best? Blunderbuss sketch by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a></p>
<p>Figure @ref(fig:blunderbuss-fig) shows two extreme approaches to job hunting, in reality you’ll probably want to strike a balance between <em>quality</em> and <em>quantity</em>. Finding jobs by quantity can set a pace and rhythm to your job search:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb38-1"><a href="#cb38-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>“I will do one application per week during term time”</span></code></pre></div>
<p>or set a time limit for what you’re prepared to do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb39"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb39-1"><a href="#cb39-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>“I&#39;ll spend two hours per week finding and applying for jobs”</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you find yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making a small number of applications, you may need to consider applying more widely and spending <em>less time</em> on each application</li>
<li>Making a large number of applications, you may need to consider applying less and spending <em>more time</em> on each application</li>
</ul>
<p>This raises the question, how big is a <em>small</em> or a <em>large</em> number of job applications, which isn’t easy to answer. Doing fifty applications over a couple of months may mean the quality of each application is too low.</p>

<p>The marketplace for job searching and job hunting advice is <em>incredibly</em> overcrowded.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.3.2</span> For any job seekers</h3>
<p>The following resources are aimed at <em>anyone</em> (not just undergraduates and graduates) looking for jobs <em>anywhere</em> in the world. Let’s start with Google job search shown in figure @ref(fig:googlejobs-fig).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/google-job-search.jpg" alt="(ref:captiongooglejobsearch)" width="90%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captiongooglejobsearch) Keywords like <code>job</code>, <code>internship</code> and <code>engineer</code> in an ordinary (vanilla) google search will trigger Google’s job search product, an enhanced search feature that aggregates listings from many different jobs boards. Here’s an example from clicking through on the results of a Google search for <code>software internship</code> (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=software+internship">google.com/search?q=software+internship</a>). You can refine your search results by <code>title</code>, <code>location</code> (my IP address means that <code>Manchester</code> has been selected automatically), <code>date posted</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>company type</code> and <code>employer</code> shown across the top of the screenshot. See the text below for more examples.</p>
<p>Google job search is a good starting point because it crawls and indexes lots of different jobs boards. It doesn’t index <em>everything</em>, see <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44853472">Google’s job hunting service comes to UK</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-noindeed">Kelion 2018</a>)</span>, but its a pretty good place to start.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Google job search indexes jobs advertised by many of the resources mentioned in this chapter. You can use google job search to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven’t used it already try the searches below. Unlike other services, Google job search works by indexing embedded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)">microdata</a> structured using <a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting">schema.org/JobPosting</a>. Keywords like <code>job</code> and <code>internship</code> in an ordinary (vanilla) google search will trigger the job search product, as shown in the following examples:</p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester">google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester</a></p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern">google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern</a></p>

<p>-Google job search is an impressive product, see <a href="https://grow.google/job-seekers">grow.google/job-seekers</a> but it doesn’t index <em>everything</em>.

<div id="portfolio" class="section level3" number="11.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.3.3</span> Pushing a public professional profile</h3>
<p>Jobs boards use the <strong>pull</strong> approach to job hunting, you search for and pull vacancies of interest. Alongside this, you can also try a <strong>push</strong> approach by publishing a professional public profile online.</p>
<p>Publishing a portfolio of your work online will allow employers and recruiters to come and find you, as well as you searching for them. Employers shouldn’t expect you to have an online portfolio and you might not want to have one, but it can help. If you choose to have a public profile, you can link to it in the header of your CV, see section @ref(mycvpd).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LinkedIn.com</strong> is a social media service which allows you to put professional details online, a bit like a semi-public or public CV, see figure @ref(fig:linkedin-fig) and table @ref(tab:linkedintable). Besides allowing you to advertise yourself, LinkedIn also:
<ul>
<li>advertises job vacancies <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/">linkedin.com/jobs</a></li>
<li>enables you to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a507508/let-recruiters-know-you-re-open-to-work">let recruiters know you’re looking for work</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-privatelysignal">Shepero 2016</a>)</span></li>
<li>allows you to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/75815/applying-for-jobs-on-linkedin?lang=en">apply for jobs directly through LinkedIn</a> although <a href="https://medium.com/otta-blog/job-boards-making-fast-applications-is-not-a-good-thing-5a4970887ecd">making fast applications is not always a good thing</a>) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fastapplications">Franklin 2019a</a>)</span></li>
<li>provides tutorials for students to get started <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students">linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students</a></li>
<li>can help you find alumni from your University via the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a567083/linkedin-page-alumni-tab-overview">alumni tab</a>. For example, see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-manchester/people/">linkedin.com/school/university-of-manchester/people</a> and <a href="https://your.manchester.ac.uk/get-involved/global-networks/">your.manchester.ac.uk/get-involved/global-networks</a>. Whatever Unviersity you are studying at, LinkedIn can be a good way finding, contacting and connecting with alumni</li>

</div>
<p>(ref:captionlinkedin) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn">Linkedin</a> is a social media service which allows you to build a professional network and public profile. It also allows employers to advertise their job vacancies. Social media caveats aside (see section @ref(signposts3)), LinkedIn can be useful tool for networking with other professionals and finding a job, see table @ref(tab:linkedintable). You can see Polly’s profile at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pollymorphism/">linkedin.com/in/pollymorphism</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Github.com</strong> allows you to publish code in public repositories that everyone can see, see figure @ref(fig:github-fig). If you’re comfortable doing it, publishing your software online can be a good way of demonstrating your technical skills and knowledge but be careful publishing your coursework online, see section @ref(mycvpj). Nothing says “<em>I can build software</em>” quite like “<em>here’s one I made earlier</em>”. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bluepeter">J. H. Blair 1958</a>)</span></li>

<p>(ref:captiongithub) Github is commonly used to host open source software development projects. As of June 2022, GitHub reported having over 83 million developers and more than 200 million repositories, including at least 28 million public repositories. The screenshot shows a profile of Computer Science student Amish Shah: <a href="https://github.com/amishshah">github.com/amishshah</a> Thanks Amish for permission to use your profile as an example, find out more about Amish in chapter @ref(amish).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stackoverflow.com</strong> You’ve probably already cut-and-pasted solutions from the question and answer forum Stack Overflow. You can also create a profile on Stack Overflow too, see figure @ref(fig:overflow-fig). As of March 2021 the site had over 14 million registered users, and had received over 21 million questions and 31 million answers.</li>

<p>So, if you’re happy to publish your work online, services like LinkedIn, Github and Stackoverflow can help you find jobs using a <em>push</em> approach alongside more conventional <em>pull</em> approaches described in section @ref(studentjobs) and @ref(generaljobs). They can also be used to augument your CV, with the stuff that doesn’t fit onto one or two printed pages. Digital profiles can be also be useful if you’re looking for freelance, contract or part-time work.</p>

<div id="speculative" class="section level3" number="11.3.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.3.4</span> Speculative applications</h3>
<p>Some job vacancies are not advertised. Employers may deliberately hide them or make them difficult to find so they aren’t swamped with lots of unsuitable applicants. Smaller employers do not always offer the kinds of experience described in section @ref(areuexperienced). In these cases, a speculative application might the only way to get a foot in the door, see figure @ref(fig:gambling-fig). In popular sectors which can be harder to break into like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game">video games</a>, a speculative application is worth considering alongside getting a recruiter to help you, described in section @ref(recruiters).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p class="caption">
(#fig:gambling-fig)(ref:captiongambling)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captiongambling) Are you playing your cards right? The stakes are high in the game of employment because there might be a job in it for you. Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling">gambling</a>, speculative applications can sometimes pay off, especially for hidden or unadvertised vacancies. You will improve your chances and strengthen your hand by researching the employer (see section @ref(bp10)), using your professional networks to connect and playing your (computational) joker, see section @ref(joker).

<p>To improve your chances of winning bets placed by your speculative applications you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do some research about the employer, see section @ref(bp10)</li>
<li>Make sure you’ve debugged your CV or résumé, see section @ref(checklist)</li>
<li>Have written a compelling and personalised covering letter, see section @ref(we3qs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your speculative application might take several different forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>traditional CV and covering letter, by email see section @ref(we3qs)</li>
<li>Phone call, these can work well with smaller employers, have your (verbal) “elevator pitch” ready see section @ref(we3qs)</li>
<li>Digital or virtual approach, eg. via LinkedIn or similar see section @ref(portfolio)</li>
<li>Speaking to employers in person e.g. at networking or other public events <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life">IRL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever form your speculative application takes, the networks that we described in section @ref(weakties) can be useful in approaching employers including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>virtual</strong>: people you’ve met online, for example in places like those described in section @ref(portfolio)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>actual</strong>: people you’ve met in real-time face to face, offline and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life#Related_terminology">IRL</a></li>
<li><strong>professional</strong> contacts: employers who have visited your University or you know via some other means</li>
<li><strong>personal</strong> contacts: friends, family, fellow students etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Making speculative applications may involve you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_calling">cold calling</a> employers, by email, phone or online. It’s a bit of a gamble, but it can sometimes work. The people in your networks can help you to make job applications that aren’t completely cold.</p>
<p>Smaller employers are more likely to be receptive to speculative job applications than larger employers. While speculative applications are a gamble, sometimes they will pay off.</p>
</div>
<div id="recruiters" class="section level3" number="11.3.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.3.5</span> What about recruiters?</h3>
<p>Recruiters can help you find work and they operate in every industry sector. They are sometimes called “head-hunters”, and there are two basic kinds that can help you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Recruiters employed directly by an employer, for example in the human resources (HR) department of a given organisation.</li>
<li>Recruiters who are self-employed or work for a recruitment agency. They typically earn money from the number of interview candidates and successful hires they provide for their clients. They are often deliberately coy about who their clients are.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recruiters are usually not technical people, so don’t expect them to any knowledge of software engineering (for example) - that isn’t usually their skill set. Although recruiters can help you, it is worth being wary of recruiters as shown in figure @ref(fig:recruiter-fig), especially if they work for an agency rather than being directly employed by the organisation you are interested in.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/recruiters-are.png" alt="(ref:captionrecruiter)" width="90%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:recruiter-fig)(ref:captionrecruiter)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionrecruiter) The autocomplete algorithm of a well known search engine gives you an idea of what <em>some</em> people think about <em>some</em> recruiters. This doesn’t mean you should avoid recruiters completely, just be careful how you use their services and pay close attention to who they work for.</p>
<p>Some recruiters are very good and can help you. For example, there are some recruitment agencies that specialise in helping employers recruit graduates, these may be useful to you. Others specialise in particular sectors such as <a href="https://www.aswift.com/">aswift.com</a> who focus on video game development. Some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_search">executive search</a> firms specialise in fields where employers struggle to find suitable candidates, such as computing.</p>
<p>However some recruiters are not very good, and don’t provide a valued service for employers or potential employees like you. This is why you sometimes see <code>no recruiters</code> or <code>no agencies</code> on job adverts. So be wary of recruiters, and remember that some recruiters work primarily for their clients (employers) not you.</p>
<p>In most cases you shouldn’t have to pay recruiters up front but job scammers will sometimes pose as recruiters so beware. Talking of job scammers, there’s some things you need to be wary of when you are job hunting:</p>

<p>Here is a small sample of complaints about recruitment, both from employers and employees. First, on dodgy CVs and résumés:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>Is the CV is dead</em>” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-howtohire">E. Davis 2023</a>)</span></li>
<li>“<em>Should you change your name to get a job?</em>” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-changeyourname">Barhat 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-homophily">Edo, Jacquemet, and Yannelis 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-emilyandgreg">Bertrand and Mullainathan 2003</a>)</span></li>

</ul>
<p>… and the fallibility of the interview process…</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>Job interviews are a nightmare — and only getting worse</em>” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-worse">Stewart 2023</a>)</span></li>
<li>“<em>Why you should never consent to a coding test in an interview</em>” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nocode">Woolley 2020</a>)</span></li>
<li>“<em>I cheated on my Microsoft interview</em>” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cheated">Sweeney 2019</a>)</span></li>
<li>“<em>What are some common criticisms of Cracking the Coding interview?</em>” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-murashenkov">Murashenkov 2019</a>)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>… and the general unreliability of hiring …</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>Your approach to hiring is all wrong</em>” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-capelli">Cappelli 2019</a>)</span></li>
<li>“<em>It’s time to streamline the hiring process</em>” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-streamline">Tarki, Cowen, and Ham 2022</a>)</span></li>
<li>“<em>Why does hiring take so long? Can’t they speed things up?</em>” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-solong">Lufkin 2021</a>)</span></li>
<li>“<em>Hiring is broken. Here’s why… and what it should be like instead</em>” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brokenhiring">Lerner 2020</a>)</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hiring+is+broken">google.com/search?q=hiring+is+broken</a> … documents a bottomless pit of pain and suffering!</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americentrism">Americentric</a> approach, these articles raise important ponits. Many of them claim that while hiring is broken, they’ve got a solution to fix it. There’s no escaping the fact that the personnel an organisation chooses to hire is one of the most important decisions it can make. Consequently, hiring the <em>wrong</em> people can lead to all sorts of (expensive) problems. Unfortunately, it seems likely that important decisions on hiring will remain complicated, time consuming and error-prone.</p>
<p>So beware of broken recruitment practices. Hiring is broken. Recruitment can be biased, bureaucratic, discriminatory, expensive, inefficient and painful for many people. It can be unfair and doesn’t always select the best candidates for the post anyway. Hiring is not just unncessarily unpleasant for you, it’s the same for employers too. Knowing this will help you prepare for its many limitations and be patient.</p>
<p>So, if you’re finding your job hunt unpleasant, you are not alone. Many recruitment practices are flawed but they are probably the “least worst” system we have, at least for now.</p>
<p><em>We are experiencing some turbulence in recruitment. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.</em> 🤕</p>

<li>Consider all your options, see chapter @ref(choosing)</li>
<li>Target employers or sectors of interest</li>

<p>.. the actual business of applying described in this chapter can be very bureaucratic. Any interviews you have will take time to prepare for (see chapter @ref(speaking)) and you’ve got loads of other calls on your time like studying and having a social life.</p>
<p>One way to tackle this problem is to schedule some time every week when you work on applications, see chapter @ref(organising). However, there’s no getting away from the fact that finding a job can consume a significant amount of your time. So beware of the time sink. ⏰</p>

<p>Employers and recruiters routinely over-specify job descriptions, see figure @ref(fig:impossible-fig). A good example of this is, when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift programming language</a> was first publicly released in 2014 at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference">Apple Worldwide Developers Conference</a> (WWDC) in California, job adverts instantly appeared asking for programmers with <code>5 years experience in Swift</code>! How can <em>anyone</em> have five years experience in a programming language that’s only just been made public?! Aside from the people who developed the language, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner">Chris Lattner</a>, the recruiters and employers must have had a <em>long</em> search trying to find their candidate. It must have taken them at least five years!</p>

<p>(ref:captionimpossible) “<em>We’re looking for someone aged 22-26 with 30 years of experience</em>”… Sometimes employers have impossible requirements so not meeting all of them shouldn’t stop you applying. Meme from <a href="https://starecat.com/">starecat.com</a></p>
<!--https://twitter.com/dullhunk/status/1551249500894896130-->
<p>The moral of this Apple story above is, if you don’t meet <em>all</em> the criteria in a job specification, that shouldn’t stop you applying. Most job adverts are over-specified as wishful employers dream up their ideal candidate.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Many employers will overstate their requirements in the hope they get their dream candidate. You might look at the job description and think, <em>I’ve only got 70% of what they’re asking for, so I won’t bother applying</em>. The reality is, if you’ve got 60% of what they are asking for, you should probably apply. It’s unlikely that <em>anyone</em> will meet 100% of the job requirements.</p>
<p>If you see things on job adverts you don’t understand or are not sure about, go and find out about them. There’s a good chance it will be similar to something you already know about, or you can self-educate yourself to fill any gaps. But beware of employers over-specifying jobs. 🤣</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.4.4</span> Beware of unpaid internships</h3>
<p>In the UK, it is illegal to employ people without paying them a salary. However, there are exceptions which can allow employers to take on unpaid interns depending on how they classify their interns employment status. See for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employment rights and pay for interns <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns">gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns</a></li>
<li>Targetjobs position on <a href="https://targetjobs.co.uk/internships/advice/275017-the-law-on-unpaid-internships-know-your-rights">the law on unpaid internships: know your rights</a></li>

<li>For more horror stories see <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships">google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In science, technology and engineering, unpaid internships are much less common than in other sectors as demand for skilled scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics">STEM</a>) is generally high. Some employers, particularly startups, may offer company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)">equity</a> (such as shares) as an alternative to a salary - again you should be wary of this. Unless you’re very lucky, the chances are those shares will probably be worthless. Although many startups aspire to become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">Unicorns</a>, very few do. Like many people, I don’t endorse unpaid internships, and I recommend you avoid them completely, see section @ref(by-salary) and figure @ref(fig:slavery-fig).</p>

<p>An unpaid internship might <em>claim</em> to be giving you:</p>
<ul>
<li>some “experience” or “exposure”</li>
<li>equity-for-work</li>
<li>something impressive for your CV</li>
<li>opportunities to “build up your portfolio”</li>
<li>improved access to paid employment at some vague (but unspecified) point the future</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, in the worst case, taking an unpaid internship leaves you vulnerable to exploitation by ruthless employers looking for cheap or free labour. Unpaid internships have been likened to modern slavery, see figure @ref(fig:slavery-fig), so I recommend you avoid them. 😭</p>
<p>There is <em>one</em> exception to this: expenses paid work-shadowing for a short period of time (two or three weeks) such as spring insights described in section @ref(areuexperienced). Otherwise, if you can’t find paid employment, doing voluntary work is a much safer bet and has mental health and social benefits too, see section @ref(areuexperienced).</p>

<p>Likewise, you should make sure you don’t undersell yourself. Know your value (financial), know your values (see chapter @ref(exploring)) and try to understand how that fits with a given employer. What are the employers stated values? When it comes to financial value, it is easy to find out about salaries, for example see:</p>

<p>Salaries in the UK for interns (and graduates) range from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage">minimum wage</a> to £50k and over, with everything in between. So beware of under-selling yourself, know your value, see @ref(by-salary). Some employers see students as a form of cheap labour that can be exploited because you’re not “qualified” until you graduate. I’d think twice before working for such an employer, computing skills are in demand and there are plenty of other employers who will treat you with more respect. 📉</p>

<!--
It is no secret that, when applying for placements and graduate jobs, you are likely to submit multiple applications before being offered a role. In response to rejections, students are often encouraged to ‘be resilient’ and ‘keep trying’ – but there’s a lot more to it than that.

While it’s important to bounce back from rejection and keep applying to opportunities, churning out one application after another in the name of resilience isn’t always productive. It is more important that you are taking steps to minimise rejection and increase your chances of success. And there are several ways that you can do this.

Don’t take a scattergun approach

You are more likely to be successful sending out five targeted, tailored applications than twenty untailored applications for roles you do not meet all the requirements for. So, my first piece of advice is to create targeted applications for opportunities you have a reasonable chance of getting (i.e. you meet all the necessary criteria).

You’ll need to tailor each application to the employer and the role, detailing why you are interested in the opportunity and giving examples of what makes you the best person for the job. This will ensure that the applications you do send out are of a high quality.

Learn from feedback

If you’re unsuccessful at interview, make use of any feedback to identify areas for improvement. It’s important that you are self-critical and that you don’t take rejection personally. Acknowledge what you did well and improve on what you could have done better, so that your next application has a greater chance of success.

Create a schedule

Set yourself a reasonable target for the number of applications you are going to submit each week. It’s important that this target is realistic for you, so be sure to factor in your other responsibilities and priorities.

Designating a specific time to work on your applications should help you stay focused and motivated. It’s also likely to safeguard against burnout; in other words, it’ll stop you from overworking yourself, which doesn’t usually do much for the quality of your work.

Moreover, working to a schedule means you’ll have ongoing applications at different stages. If you receive a rejection from one application, you’re likely to have others in progress, which should help you stay motivated and remain optimistic.

Keep an open mind

Try to think laterally when choosing which opportunities to apply for. It can be tempting to apply to companies which you are already familiar with, and while there are lots of advantages of working for large, well-known organisations, there are just as many benefits to working for medium-sized companies and SMEs that you perhaps might not have heard of.

By considering the full range of companies on Gradcracker, you open yourself up to more opportunities, and more chances of success.

Equally, don’t just go for the opportunities that are directly related to your degree discipline. As a STEM student, your transferable skills make you highly sought after in a diverse range of sectors and roles, so try to keep an open mind when searching for opportunities.

Now, it’s time to try again!
I hope these steps help you to bounce back from rejection – but also to prevent rejection and increase your chances of success.-->

<p>Your future is bright, your future needs moving, so let’s start moving your future.</p>
<div id="south" class="section level2" number="12.1">

<p>For example, if you’re seeking work or further study in the United Kingdom, there are lots of possibilities in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxbridge">Loxbridge</a> (<strong>Lo</strong>ndon, <strong>Ox</strong>ford and Cam<strong>bridge</strong>).

<p>If you’re looking for a job in the UK you don’t have to exclusively target the South (London) to find top employers, there are plenty located in the North too: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_the_North">Hit the North</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hitthenorth">M.

<p>Northerners have often argued that Northern England offers a better quality of life than London we couldn’t possibly comment other than to say its horses for courses. The North West Tech Community calendar, provides a window on (and networking opportunities with) many of employers based in the North West <a href="https://technw.uk">technw.uk</a> if you want to find out more. As Sharon Dale once said: its NotJustLondon <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-notjustlondon">Dale 2018</a>)</span></p>
<p>So, it’s wrong to assume that capital cities like London are where <em>all</em> the best opportunities are. That’s true in the UK and also in many other countries too, and the rise of working from home during the pandemic has changed our relationship with cities. You might need to consider moving your future.</p>
<p>This is a partial list of employers in the North West of England (aka the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Powerhouse">Northern Powerhouse</a>) that recruit Computer Science students. This is not a comprehensive list of all tech companies in the North West, but will give you a quick flavour of employers in the Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Northern England.</p>

<p>Having debugged your CV, and worked out which employers to apply to, in the next part, chapter @ref(speaking): <em>Speaking your Future</em> we’ll look at preparing for interviews which will test your spoken communication skills.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">13</span> Speaking your future</h1>
<p>Congratulations, you’ve been invited to an interview. It might be by telephone, video link, in person or as part of an assessment centre where you’ll be asked to complete several other tasks and tests. Being invited to an interview means that your written application (CV, covering letter, application form or digital portfolio) has hit the target and is bug free, see figure @ref(fig:bugfree-fig). All that reading and writing has paid off. BULLSEYE! 🎯</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionbugfree) If you have got an interview, then you have proved that your CV is bug free. That doesn’t mean your CV is perfect, it just means that it is good enough to get you an interview with that particular employer. Congratulations! What comes next?

<p>Having passed the first stage of <em>reading and writing</em>, you move onto <em>listening and speaking</em> stage of interviewing. One of your goals is to convince the interviewers that you can articulate yourself clearly, and communicate well by listening carefully to their questions and answering with spoken natural language. These are fundamental communication skills discussed in section @ref(cio) on communication I/O.</p>
<p>If you’ve got an interview, you can feel good about having a bug-free CV shown in figure @ref(fig:bugfree-fig). Now you have a new set of problems to tackle. How can you prepare for the interview? What kinds of interviews exist and what questions might you be asked? If they offer you a job, how will you negotiate the terms, conditions and salary? Do you <em>really</em> want the job and are they the kind of people you actually want to work with everyday? If successful, you will be giving this employer:</p>
<ul>
<li>most of the hours of your day</li>
<li>most of the days of your week</li>
<li>most of the weeks of your year</li>
</ul>
<p>This job will take a significant chunk of the next few months, year or even up to two years (and more) for a graduate scheme <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jonathanblack">J. Black 2019a</a>)</span>. It’s the start of a much longer journey of up to <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 hours</a> that you’ll spend in employment during your life, or to put it another way:</p>
<ul>
<li>most of the years of your life</li>
</ul>
<p>So you want to ensure employers are a good match and not going to waste your time. You’ll be interviewing them, as well as them interviewing you, so it will pay to have some questions prepared alongside your answers to questions you can anticipate.</p>
<p>Your future is bright, your future needs speaking, so let’s start speaking your future.</p>

<p>Competency interviews test some of your softer skills, find out who you are (see chapter @ref(exploring)), how you work in a team and if you can communicate well. They can also known as behavioural or situational judgement interviews. A good interview strategy for any interview is to talk about what you are doing (and what you have done) as shown in figure @ref(fig:overthinking-fig). It might even help to have a checklist in your head of things you’d like to talk about such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>one work experience, see chapter @ref(experiencing)</li>
<li>a couple of projects, see section @ref(mycvpj)</li>
<li>some university projects, see section @ref(mycvpj).</li>

<p>(ref:captionoverthinking) During an interview, you are marketing yourself to an employer while they market themselves to you. It can be easy to overthink your marketing.

<p>Here are some common competency interview questions. Imagine you are going on a stage, prepare lines that answer these questions, rehearse them out loud in front of a mirror (or a critical friend).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What roles do you play in a team, with examples?</li>
<li>Tell me about a time when you showed integrity and professionalism</li>
<li>Can you give an example of a situation where you solved a problem in a creative way?</li>
<li>Tell me about a big decision you’ve made recently. How did you go about it?</li>
<li>Give an example of a time you resolved conflict</li>
<li>How do you maintain healthy working relationships with your team?</li>

<li>Give me an example of a challenge you faced and tell me how you overcame it</li>
<li>How do you influence people in a situation with conflicting agendas?</li>
<li>Tell me about a time that you made a decision and then changed your mind.</li>
<li>Tell me about a time when you achieved success even when the odds were stacked against you.</li>
<li>Tell me about a time when you have provided an excellent service</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.2.3</span> Coding interviews</h3>
<p>Many employers use technical or coding interviews to assess your harder skills. Not every employer does, but they are widely used by employers. Preparing for coding interviews is a good way to become a better engineer, so even if you don’t have to face a series of really tough coding interviews, it is worth knowing about them.</p>
<div class="rmdcaution">
<p>(ref:codingcaution)</p>
<p>The competitive coding and technical interviews described in this chapter test a narrow set of algorithmic skills. While it’s important to prepare for technical interviews, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-criticisms-of-Cracking-the-Coding-interview">they have well documented limitations</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-murashenkov">Murashenkov 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-hackpack">Habib 2022</a>)</span> Skills required for software engineering go beyond the purely technical ones. For example, your (soft) communication skills outlined in chapter @ref(writing), and many other broader skills, are just as important as your (hard) technical abilities.</p>

1. Using a whiteboard (or even google docs), you're unlikely to have access to a compiler or an IDE
1. Pattern matching (what interview questions are similar to this)
1. Simplify and generalise (tweak constraints, then does that approach )
1. Clarify the question, state your assumptions
1. Base case and build () start from n = 1, then build to n = 2 etc [@polya]

Solving different coding challenges can help you become a better problem solver, master a given programming language, prepare for job interviews and learn new algorithms. It will help you become a better engineer and can provide good evidence for the experience section of your CV.-->
<p>There are a lots of resources to help you prepare for and practice coding interview questions, a good place to start is <em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell">Gayle Laakmaan McDowell</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cracking">McDowell 2015</a>)</span> As well as reading Gayle’s book, there are lots of online resources to help you prepare for coding interviews.

<!--if kipling-->
<p>Coding interviews can be tough, but preparing for them, and doing them will also make you a better engineer. So if you spectacularly wipeout in your coding interview, reflect and think how can you improve next time? Perhaps you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read up on some more data structures</li>
<li>Familiarise yourself with more algorithms</li>
<li>Practice thinking out loud (verbally) by doing a mock technical interview?</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these activities will help both your general professional development and your chances of success in future technical interviews. Thankfully there are plenty of resources out there for helping you get better at coding interviews, so let’s have a look at some. Some of these resources are more about problem solving for recreation, rather than interview preparation, but they will all help you become a better engineer.</p>

<p>(ref:captionicpc) In their own words, ICPC is “an algorithmic programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-icpc">Hacker 2021</a>)</span></p>
<p>ICPC is organised by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery">Association for Computing Machinery</a> (ACM), a global community which advances computing as a science and a profession.</p>
<p>There are subregional contests for ICPC, so in the UK there is the United Kingdom and Ireland Programming Competition (UKIEPC) which is part of the Northwestern Europe European Regional Contest (NWERC).</p>
<p>UKIEPC has been held annually since 2013 to help universities pick teams to travel to NWERC. Ask your University if they are involved, see <a href="http://ukiepc.info">ukiepc.info</a>. If they aren’t involved yet, you could encourage them to join. It’s not just about winning, it’s also about taking part.</p>

You may decide to change your mind about an offer you've already accepted. You need to

* Are you sure? Think it through carefully, discuss your options with friends and family.
* Read your contract of employment again: there may be clauses in your contract describing the consequences of changing your mind - make sure you understand these
* Tell the employer quickly: explain why you've changed your mind (personal circumstances, you have a better offer etc) the sooner the better
* Learn from this mistake: it's not good to accept offers you're not serious about so try to learn from this mistake so you don't repeat it in the future

<li>celebrate: well done you!</li>
<li>negotiate: can you get a better offer?</li>
<li>ruminate: is this <em>really</em> the job you want?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not happy with the package on offer, the best time to negotiate is <strong>before</strong> you accept it. It is often easier to negotiate now, than get a pay rise later. This is one factor that means people leave jobs, it is often easier to get a pay rise by moving employers, rather than being promoted with an existing employer. Knowing your value is important here, its easy to find out with sites like glassdoor we mentioned in section @ref(generaljobs).

Besides the pay, you might also want to negotiate your working conditions such flexible working, start date and any benefits on offer.</p>
<!--This is not a book about negotiation but see never split the difference-->
<p>If you are lucky enough to receive <em>multiple</em> job offers you may have to make some difficult decisions about timing the acceptance or rejection of offers. You might even decide to withdraw a previously accepted job offer. I am not a lawyer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL">IANAL</a>) and can’t give you legal advice but if you change your mind, read what your signed contract of employment says before you withdraw your acceptance, to see what your legal obligations are.</p>

<p>Interviews are about a lot more than the answers you give to questions, they also test <em>how</em> you communicate, both verbally and non-verbally.

<p>You might find it a bit scary thinking about your future. You might be tempted to procrastinate making important decisions about your future, see figure @ref(fig:schedule-fig). There is a risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)">thrashing</a> or getting stuck in a <code>do-nothing</code> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting"><code>busy waiting</code></a> loop. This guidebook is here to help you break out of that loop. One way to breakout of an unproductive loop is to organise and schedule some time every week where you work on personal development and job applications. Doing good applications takes time and you’ll probably find you can’t do as many applications as you might like, especially when you consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law">Hofstadter’s law</a>: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.1</span> Building your future</h2>
<p>In section @ref(by-quantity) and @ref(by-quantity) we discussed the importance of timing in your job search. <em>When</em> you apply for jobs will determine <em>what</em> kind of jobs are available because most graduate schemes and graduate jobs follow a rhythmic recruitment cycle of some kind. How many jobs you apply for is largely a function of how much time you spend doing it. The more time you spend, the more applications you can do.</p>
<p>We haven’t explicitly discussed the timing and organisation of the activities outlined in the preceding chapters:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Designing your Fututure</em> in chapters @ref(rebooting) to @ref(computing)</li>
<li><em>Testing your Future</em> in chapters @ref(debugging) to @ref(speaking)</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s imagine you could precisely specify all of the tests using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a> in a <code>makefile</code> or specify them somehow in your favourite Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Ideally, you’d like to automatically run these tests, so that you can build your future systematically. You’d like to repeat these tests periodically, e.g. once a day, week, month or whatever your schedule is, similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation">build automation</a> in software engineering. Attempts to automate aspects of job applications and interviews have so far had very mixed results. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-airesume">Schellmann 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-dastinai">Dastin 2018</a>)</span> But, as another thought experiment, let’s image it was possible</p>

<p>Your future is bright, your future needs organising. Organising your future will help you build your future. Building your future will help to start coding your future.</p>
<p>Building your future is a bit like building software, with testing and compilation. Except for when it isn’t. Like many analogies, are computational analogy of building software breaks down, so in the rest of this section, we’ll look at some other aspects of building, not in the automated software sense, but the broader sense of <em>Building your Future</em> generally.</p>
<p>We’ll start with chapter @ref(researching): <em>Researching your Future</em> investigating postgraduate study and research. Are they the right path for you? How can you know?</p>
<p><em>Researching your Future</em> might sound like a part of <em>Designing your Future</em> section, but it fits better as a <em>Deploying your Future</em> chapter. Your decision to do further study and research might come <em>after</em> a period of paid employment, either as a summer internship, year long placement or graduate position.</p>
<p>So researching is a deployment issue, rather than a design issue as we shall see.</p>

<p>Commercial or real-world experience is valuable in academia and academic experience is valuable beyond academia. So, if you think you need to choose between the two, think again. Doing an internship or placement with a commercial company can be useful background for a career in academia, both in research and teaching. Lots of research is done in partnerships between commercial companies and Universities, some of these create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company">startups</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_spin-off">University spin-offs</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off">corporate spin-offs</a> etc.</p>
<p>Your learning shouldn’t stop when you finish University either, so you might work for a bit, study for a bit, work a bit more and so on. You might even study part-time. Some of this study might be formal and academic with qualifications, others might be badged in different ways. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning">lifelong learning</a>, see section @ref(lifelonglearning) and chapter @ref(achieving).</p>

<p>(ref:tldr)</p>
<p>Your future is bright, your future might be in research. Researching your future could be part of deploying your future. Deploying your future is a key part of coding your future.</p>
<p>Research and study can be enjoyable activities in their own right, but they aren’t always the best path for every undergraduate. Knowing what postgraduate research and study are actually about and how they differ from undergraduate study will help you determine if you have a future in research.</p>
<p>Is research the right place for you? Doing postgraduate research will be very different to a lot of your study to date, so if you’re thikning about doing it, you need to go in with your eyes wide open.</p>
<p>In the next section, chapter @ref(enjoying): <em>Enjoying your Future</em> we’ll take a musical interlude before meeting some students who are <em>Coding their Future</em> in the final section of this book from chapter @ref(hearing) onwards.</p>
<p>This chapter is under construction because I’m using agile book development methods, see figure @ref(fig:deathstar9-fig).</p>

<p>Music is deeply connected to your mental health and your sense of wellbeing that we discussed in chapter @ref(nurturing). Music has the ability to comfort and connect you to others and yourself by providing motivation, gratification and empathy. There’s plenty of scientific evidence that listening to music can enhance your mood. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-zatorre">Zatorre, Chen, and Penhune 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-dopamine">McGilchrist 2011</a>)</span></p>

<!--More on communication needed feedback from norway

Another big difference is that in employment everyone starts from scratch all the time, in my experience. In university starting from scratch / being 'behind' is a common insecurity, which made it difficult for me to ask for help when I needed it. It took a while to learn that at work you succeed and fail as a team, not an individual, and there is nothing wrong with not understanding and asking for help.

In short, I agree with you that a lot of "survive, thrive or die" lies in your relationship with your manager and team. Hence I wish you wrote more about this than a tweet from 'Help! I have a manager!'. It is very good, but I didn't think to spend the $10 for it when I needed it the most. Especially when a lot of the "Stay in school" section could be repeated in "Achieving your future".-->
<!--Different ways for success
The example for thriving purely mentions promotion as a good. I think it could be valuable to underline that good communication and self-reflection could lead to not any promotion, but promotion to a fulfilling role!

I think the chapter outlines some of the broader challenges going from uni to employment.  Where I feel the chapter lacks is in fully diving into the best ways to avoid "diving" and maybe even getting to "thrive". A lot of the chapter is spent on furthering your career and self-development, which presumes "surviving" with capacity for more or "thriving".-->

<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.2</span> Survive, thrive or dive?</h2>
<p>Starting a new job is a bit like starting a new relationship, except that it is professional rather than romantic one. You’ve searched for and found a partner. If this had happened on Tinder, your employer “swiped right” on your profile because they liked the look of you. You’ve both been through the courtship of recruitment. Your courting may have been quick or you may have had many rounds of first and second “dates”, known as interviews. Now that your are starting contractual employment, you are both committed to each other in a serious relationship. Simply put, there are three scenarios for you as a new employee:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You’ll survive</li>
<li>You’ll thrive</li>
<li>You’ll dive</li>
</ol>
<div id="survive" class="section level3" number="17.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.2.1</span> Survive</h3>
<p>Your new job will go OK, you’ll meet the expectations of your employer and become and valued employee. If your employer has a probationary period, you’ll pass your probationary review without any problems. Most employees probably fit in to this category. 🆗</p>
</div>
<div id="thrive" class="section level3" number="17.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.2.2</span> Thrive</h3>
<p>Your new job will go brilliantly, you’ll exceed the expectations of your employer. If you’re on a fixed term contract, such as a summer internship or year long placement, they’ll make you a job offer during or soon after your contract of employment expires. If you’re on a more permanent contract, such as a graduate job or graduate scheme you’ll be promoted, given a pay rise and more responsibility. 💪</p>
<p>You’re doing really well if you can impress your manager. Some lucky people make it into this category.</p>
</div>
<div id="dive" class="section level3" number="17.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.2.3</span> Dive</h3>
<p>Your new job will go badly, you will struggle to fit in and won’t meet the expectations of your employer.

<p>There are several relationship problems that could lead to you breaking up with (or being dumped by) your newly estranged “lover”. 💔</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationship problems</strong>: Your relationship with your manager(s) is not going well. You’ve tried solving problems informally by talking to your manager but you’re not satisfied with the response and want to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/raise-grievance-at-work">raise a formal grievance complaint in writing</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-grievance">Servant 2021c</a>)</span></li>

<li><strong>It’s not me, it’s you</strong>: If things get really bad, your employer may <a href="https://www.gov.uk/disciplinary-procedures-and-action-at-work">take disciplinary action against you</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dive">Servant 2021a</a>)</span> and in the worst case scenario, you’ll be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/dismissal">fired (dismissed)</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-yourefired">Servant 2021b</a>)</span></li>
<li><strong>Becoming unhappier</strong>: You were looking for a job and now you’ve found a job. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Knows_I%27m_Miserable_Now">Heaven knows you’re miserable now</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-miserablenow">Marr and Morrissey 1984</a>)</span> Perhaps you’re not being challenged enough or given too much work that you’re not interested in?

</ul>
<p>In the UK, dismissal is rare, but it <strong>does</strong> happen, even to interns and placement students. In this scenario in the UK, the employer has a duty to do everything they reasonably can to prevent this from happening. It’s not in your employers interests to fire you because they’ve invested a lot of time and money in you by this point. If they have sensible recruitment procedures, those procedures will root out unsuitable candidates long before they make it to the workplace where they can cause real and lasting damage to the organisation once in post.</p>
<p>All employers have procedures for making sure that you can agree on work that suits both of your needs. Better employers will have better procedures to ensure this happens. Employers don’t want their employees to “dive” and will try prevent this from happening wherever possible. So, speak to your manager(s) and keep the communication channels open. Talking of managers …</p>

<div id="manager" class="section level2" number="17.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.3</span> Managing your manager</h2>
<p>Building a good relationship with your manager(s) will be key to determining which of the <em>dive, survive or thrive</em> scenarios above plays out. At University, you didn’t have a manager. Yes you had deadlines, but you didn’t have a boss. That changes when you’re an employee so it’s in your interests to understand what your boss expects of you.</p>
<p>Software engineer Julia Evans has authored a series of programming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine">zines</a>, there’s one called <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/manager/">HELP!

It will help you understand your managers job better so that you can work together more effectively. It will help you survive and thrive, not dive because it covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>understanding your manager’s job</li>
<li>setting clear expectations</li>
<li>talking about problems early</li>
<li>reviewing performance and getting promoted</li>
<li>asking for specific feedback</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.4</span> Stay in school</h2>
<p>As you develop new skills and knowledge at work, it is a good idea to collect evidence of what you’ve done. Whatever your career path, you’ll need to keep your CV updated. One way to think of the evidence is as <em>badges</em>, digital or otherwise. Your employer may already have training schemes that recognise and reward your accomplishments. These badges may be generic or specific to the particular sector you are working in. See chapter @ref(achieving) on <em>Achieving your future</em> for more details.</p>
<div id="techie" class="section level3" number="17.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.4.1</span> Technical badges</h3>

<li>Google Cloud Certification <a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification">cloud.google.com/certification</a></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.4.2</span> Non-technical badges</h3>

<li>Building resilience</li>
<li>Negotiating and managing conflict</li>

<p>The choice of lifelong learning can be bewildering.

<p>Besides collecting evidence and managing your manager, you need to manage yourself too. A proven way to do this is to periodically reflect on your work. Your employer may have procedures to help you do this, such as performance reviews or one-to-ones with your manager on a regular basis. Whatever the setup, you will benefit from taking time to reflect on:
<!--During your placement you will be visited by an academic member of staff who will meet with you and your manager at the same time. If you want to meet with your academic tutor without your manager being around, please let your tutor know] The visit is a good opportunity to reflect on what progress you have made during the year alongside areas you need to improve.

<p>Your future is bright, your future needs starting. Starting your future is the first step of deploying your future. Deploying your future is coding your future.</p>
<p>Making the transition from education to employment can be a big and daunting change. To make the change as smooth as possible, you may need to readjust your expectations because being a student is very different to being an employee. Some key differences include:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a manager when you are an employee, who you need to maintain a good working relationship with</li>
<li>Your performance is much more dependent on other people (your colleagues), unlike in education where you can often work more independently (e.g. when completing coursework or revising for an exam)</li>
<li>You get paid, which hopefully makes it all worthwhile!</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the keys to <em>surviving your future</em> are therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicating early and often with your manager(s) about any issues you have in the workplace, see section @ref(manager)</li>
<li>Regularly reflecting on your progress, with and without your manager, see section @ref(reflecting)</li>
<li>Understanding that working with people is challenging for everyone (and enjoyable for many), see figure @ref(fig:frances-fig)</li>
<li>Staying in school. Despite leaving formal education, you should never stop learning, see section @ref(neverstoplearning)</li>

<p>One kind of badge you get when you finish University is your degree certificate like the one shown in figure @ref(fig:degree-cert-fig). A degree certificate is an important offline physical (paper) badge that marks a milestone in your career. If you like gaming, its a huge <code>achievement unlocked</code> that will take you to the next level. Your certificate also tells people that you were a member of a particular University community and that you mastered your chosen discipline to some level, Bachelors, Masters or PhD.</p>

<p>Degree certificates are an important badge, but they don’t give very many details of your professional and personal story while at University. You could give more details by providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>your overall degree classification: first, second, third etc</li>
<li>your individual module grades, for example in an academic transcript or by listing them on your CV, see section @ref(mycved)</li>
<li>your projects, see section @ref(mycvpj)</li>
<li>your portfolio of work, if you have one</li>
</ul>
<p>This data give a <em>bit</em> more detail that a degree certificate does not but it is limited to purely academic achievements. You are <em>much</em> more than your grades, because there’s a lot about your character that is difficult or impossible to measure, see figure @ref(fig:more-than-grades-fig).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">18.3</span> Digital badges</h2>
<p>Digital badges provide a solution to this problem, just like your degree certificate is a verified badge of your achievements, a digital badge does the same but in a digital way. Rather than being physical, a digital badge is virtual and transferable. It’s just a <code>*.png</code> graphic file which has been digitally signed and contains metadata. This means it can be displayed on your CV, on social media such as LinkedIn or “stacked” into a digital portfolio collection as shown in figure @ref(fig:badge-properties-fig).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation">Mozilla Foundation</a> have defined an open standard for digital badges <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-openbadges">Enabler 2019</a>)</span> so that badges can be issued, hosted and certified by different organisations. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-belshaw">Belshaw 2019</a>)</span></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">19.1</span> Know who you are</h2>
<p>There is a lot more to you than your degree. There is a lot more to you than your grades. Yes, you’ve spent (or will be spending) three or four years getting your degree.

<!--understand your brand your values, another word for brand is reputation. do people like you. The better you know yourself, the better-->
<p>Being able to articulate your self-awareness to employers will make writing a CV (chapter @ref(debugging)) and interviewing (chapter @ref(speaking)) a lot easier. Both rely on you be able to express yourself in written and spoken language. You should aim to strike a balance between humbly underselling yourself (see section @ref(undersell)) and proudly overselling yourself, see section @ref(oversell). If you have digital profiles like those described in section @ref(portfolio), how accurate a reflection of you are they? Is your digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego">alter ego</a> at odds with reality?</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">19.2</span> Look after yourself</h2>
<p>Studying at University can be enjoyable but it can also make you stressed, anxious and depressed. If you neglect to look after yourself mentally and physically, things can start to fall apart. Choose your reference points carefully, try not to compare yourself to the person at the top of the class: see Carmen’s advice in chapter @ref(carmen). Ask yourself, am I doing better than last time? Be kind to yourself because nurturing yourself now will nurture your future, see chapter @ref(nurturing).</p>

<p>At University, you are quite likely to be surrounded by people who have more experience, better knowledge, higher grades or more skills than you. That might not have been the case at high school if you were top (or near the top) of your class. While it is natural to compare yourself to the best, you should do so with caution. The important thing is that you are working to towards the best version of yourself, not necessarily the best in your class anymore.</p>

<li>Unproductive mistakes: those you didn’t learn anything from (and risk repeating)</li>

One way to turn unproductive mistakes into productive ones is deliberately and consciously reflect on why you made them. This is part of the growth mindset we discussed in chapter @ref(nurturing).</p>
<p>In a growth mindset, mistakes can be good, but the fear of making them is not. You are more likely to take more chances when you’re unafraid to fail, and this will improve your chances of success. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cherish">Swartz 2012</a>)</span></p>
<p>Many education systems around the world don’t teach people how to fail, because they put too much emphasis on success (as measured by grades and rewards) rather than progress, learning and happiness. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-failgift">Lahey 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-punished">Kohn 2018</a>)</span> So as the angel investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson">Esther Dyson</a> once said, “Always make new mistakes”, see figure @ref(fig:esther-dyson-fig)</p>

<p>(ref:captionestherdyson) Mistakes are inevitable in life, so there’s no shame in making them especially if they are new. Making <em>new</em> mistakes can be a form of productive failure that you learn from rather than a source of unproductive failure that you repeat (old mistakes).

<li>If you’ve got some harsh feedback on your CV, how can you make less buggy in the future?</li>
<li>If you’ve applied to lots of companies and not even had a reply yet, how can you improve your job search strategy?</li>
<li>If you’ve neglected to develop interests and projects outside of work, how can you rebalance?</li>
<li>If you crashed and burned in an interview, how can you use the experience to do better next time?</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">25.1</span> What’s your story Ivo?</h2>
<p>So welcome Ivo, could you just tell us a little bit about yourself? What’s your name on where do you come from? I’ve already introduced you, but who are you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: So my name is Ivaylo Iliev but just call me Ivo. That’s easier for everybody and that’s anywhere what everybody calls me and, I am from Bulgaria from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia">Sofia</a>, the Capital and right now I’m a final year students,
it’s gonna graduate in a couple of months Actually in a month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you just had exams, you’re in the middle of exam. So thank you for coming in the middle of the exam period. Right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Yeah, exams on the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how many exams you got left?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: I got only two exams total and I’ve not done any book, so that’s good. I’m yeah, it’s not going to be anything too much and I’m kind of calm about everything right now, so it’s fine.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="ivowhy" class="section level2" number="25.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">25.2</span> Why study Computer Science?</h2>
<p>Good. So if we can take a step back to the beginning, so why did you decide to study Computer Science. What was it about studying computer science that interests you. Had it been something from a long time ago?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: it’s quite interesting because honestly when I had to choose I had a year and how before I started uni and I had to kind of choose what I wanted to study. It was between a lot of things I had business in mind because I had been doing a bit of startups back then. Computer science definitely since I was in mathematical high school and a lot of the people over there went to to do computer science or something software engineering related. And there were a bunch of other things but I think definitely the the big choice was between business and computer science. And Definitely, the thing that pushed me over a little bit into computer science because that I wanted to get something tangible and something that I can see, some skills that I can practically do and get myself some kind of job that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that kind of Applied aspect of it, the kind of vocational expoed aspect of computing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Yeah. Definitely and as well since it’s related to mathematics definitely and I’ve always had this kind of interest, I mean, I used to be a gamer. I always had an interest in computers, how they work, why they do stuff that they do. And, yeah, I was always fascinated by by computers. So that was kind of an addition to all of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay good. So you arrived here? Two and a half years ago was that after was that after lockdown or was your first year in lockdown or yeah, It’s a little bit of a blurb,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Definitely for me, as well, honestly, because when I arrived in September 2020, it was kind of in the middle of the pandemic or like, it’s starred-ish of the pandemic, right? It was like March, I think it’s started, Um, and i went here hopeful that everything is going to be fine and there’s not going to be any more lockdowns. And unfortunately, two months later. So just for two months and then I went back home because there was imposed Lockdown. And I thought that myself that since everything is online right now, I might as well just do it from home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All right,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: so fast forward a year and something After that. And I came actually, I came in Manchester honestly quite reasonably just January last year. So 2022, I’ve had kind of a year and a half here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. Okay. And so in your first year you did a summer internship in was that the end of your first year at the end of your second year?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: It was the end of my second year it summer between second and third year so last summer basically, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So and did you have, did you do anything in the summer of first year, where you just you would just at home.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: So I really try doing a couple of things. So first, I was part of I became part of a society game development Society that we were working on a game. And I wanted to kind of extend that into the summer, right? And also, the other thing that, I was searching for internships on honestly. Well, I couldn’t land one. I was very ill-informed and didn’t put too much effort into it but eventually I got kind of not a role but I was helping some like a startup as a voluntary work. But both this and again development society kind of they did in didn’t continue through the whole summer They kind of fell apart. So basically my first summer between first and second year it was like but of hanger because I didn’t I wasn’t really able to get any serious internship and any real work done, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay. So you came back in to second year?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: I’ve done sort of bits and pieces in the summer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was in Bulgaria. I guess was it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Um, so that was for a UK startup and for the society that’s in the university. So I try to direct myself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you were the game dev part of <a href="https://unicsmcr.com/">UniCS</a> or game dev part of UniCS I think, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: It was yeah. Okay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, then in your beginning of second year, I guess you kind of did that make you think actually, I do want to get a summer internship next summer. And then, did you start looking in September? Or how did that work out in your second year?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: So it was, it was kind of mixed because I definitely wanted to get an internship. But at the same time, I didn’t really have the the capacity especially the start of second year then have the capacity to get my applications done and look for companies kind of And, So the result of all that was that I came here in like January and I had to study for exams and at the same time it was high time that I start applying and start looking for companies and positions. I mean, looking back now, I think that was very late doing that but still I Yeah, I did my exams and then after that immediately, I focused on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, sometimes you to advertise a bit later in the year so if you would have been looking for a placement sometimes these get advertised the beginning of the academically are September but sometimes somewhere internships sometimes get advertised a little bit later Is that whereas I’ve been your experience or would you think you would have been better applying for summer internships?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: From September rather than you started in January. I mean i’ll definitely prefer to how started in let’s say September, but I think for me from what I’ve seen, it’s more about, I guess, definitely for for placements, people want to get it out of the way, like companies want to get it out of the way sooner rather than later. While summer internships is a different thing, but I’ve seen that, I mean Yeah, banks definitely want to get out all of the internships. And finish with selecting candidates until like December. Let’s say, so I had virtually no chances with banks, right? Okay,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you mentioned, one choice of students faces like should I do a submer internship? Or should I do a young placement? And so I was interested to know like why did you choose somewhere internship rather than a year long placement?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: So the deciding factor for me because I had an offer for a placement and for a summer internship, I had to office and the deciding factor for me, wasn’t what I wanted to do, one of the other. But rather their companies that and the positions that I was selected for, right? Um, so yeah, definitely I was open to both of them. I thought that it will be good because obviously, in a placement, you do get a whole year of experience, but Um, at the same time, if you don’t get a placement then, by the time people finish their placement, you already graduated so that you can start a graduate role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, yeah. It’s quite I guess it’s quicker, right? So you graduated sooner, you don’t pay fees for that, You probably. I think, I don’t know if it’s a factor in your case, but I know some students say that’s a factor, I don’t want to pay fees for that? (See section @ref(interns) for a fuller discussion)</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">25.3</span> Amazon Web Services</h2>

<p>Remote or in person?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Both, it was honestly a bit of both but I really wanted to be in person for the whole time. And I think this was a great decision because I found out that, it brings you a lot of value to actually go into office, meet people and make these sorts of connections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think, especially early on in your career definitely (see, for example <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-summerinthecity">Quinio and Uddin 2023</a>)</span>) I would say that I think once you become established it’s kind of easier to work remotely but I think at the beginning, Is that those kinds of social interactions and Some help has more important than they are later on. Because you’re looking for mentors and guidance and learning from people who’ve. Done, you know, done this sort of for years. So what was your role at amazon web services? So this actually came up as a question in the presentation (see figure @ref(fig:ivotalking-fig)) you gave to first years about this and someone said, <em>What’s a solutions architect?</em> And I don’t think we actually had time to answer the question, but what is a you were a solution’s architect? What does a solutions architect do?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Well, I don’t blame them because the first time I saw the stuff they sent me the test for the, for the position. I was like, oh, why did I apply to this? And then I read the description. I was like, okay, that’s sounds interesting. But yeah, basically solutions architect is a role which entails many different responsibilities. So, on one side, the way they explained it to me, and I’ve found it is on one side. You have to be very capable of knowing the services that they provide in terms of cloud and the way these services can interact with one another and kind of being able to look at an application, Let’s say that has been deployed on premises, So on servers in-house and then being able to kind of transform it into a bunch of services in AWS, which are linked together and creating those sorts of solutions. Um as well as I guess understanding the security part of things, how costly it’s going to be for the client, kind of thinking about about all of these things as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so were you talking to clients? Who was that done by somebody else in the organisation, you were kind of there as a somebody to come speak to internally or was it something where you’d actually gun? Meet customers yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: So my particular role was Very much liike the technical part was 50% of the work, The other 50% of the work was actually talking to engineers talking to executives sometimes and just giving them advice on how they could better understand the cloud and better make use of the cloud in order to fulfil their business needs and business goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right, Okay. So the business stuff is kind of, I guess because you mentioned, you’re interested in that. So some some computer scientists aren’t very interested in business at all, but I guess you were perhaps more more than some students I know who kind of don’t really care about the business side of things. You enjoyed that aspect of it as well as the technical side, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Most definitely, I think that’s a way better role, way more suited for me as somebody who has had experience actually talking to, like being a founder myself for first, doing startups and then not only that, but also talking to different kinds of people. I’m used to doing that. I am, I’m very much enjoying that. I wouldn’t be able. I quickly realised while I was doing this internship and chatting with friends about what they’re doing in their software engineering internships that it’s definitely not for me to sit for the whole day and just write code. It’s definitely, I’m way more enjoyable process for me to know the technical side of things, how they work, and why they work, but also being able to communicate that on a daily basis with other people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And actually doing both can give you that variety, right? Because you’re not just talking to customers the whole time. You’re also, then, I guess implementing things or kind of figuring stuff out the, you know, what, how the services works you must have learnt a lot about some very complex ecosystem of services, on Amazon web services, and just learning about that. You could spend years learning that stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Definitely? Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, you talked about this in your talk a little bit. But what were the main obstacles you faced and finding employment and how did you overcome them? I mean, one thing you mentioned there was perhaps not being informed as well as you could have been in the process. So how did you overcome that in your job search?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: So my job search. I mean, definitely the advice that that you gave us in first and second, you’re like, throughout the years, I have kind of remembered some of the stuff that sometimes you, you tell us like a quick tip. Oh, you can use this website to, to find jobs or whatever. But yeah, definitely. These these pieces of advice. I came back to them and I’m really, really helped me get through all of this because at the beginning you just sitting along in your room and you’re like, I know I have done some stuff, but how does that transform into the real world and who would be able to give me money for that, right? So it’s definitely, it’s definitely a lengthy process, and it’s not only a process of a searching within, let’s say LinkedIn or Google gradcracker for jobs, but <strong>it’s also searching within yourself, and I think that’s kind of been underestimated.</strong> On that, you need to kind of think about what exactly do I want to do? (see chapters @ref(finding) and @ref(choosing)). I want to do like what do I want my work to kind of look like or feel like based on different things that you’ve done before. So for me as I said already, I had done work communicating with people at that point in time. I had also been doing presentation skills training so I knew that I had to do some communication right? But then as well I’m studying computer science and I love computers and technology So I knew that it had to do something with technology as well. So, I was applying to, I mean, the standard software engineering positions because I, you want to take these expectations of the job, but also want to get something realistic on the other side. So, I applied to all the software engineering positions, but I also apply to many product manager positions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Or like, internships, placements, because they’ve been popping around quite a lot recently. And, and all sorts of technical and communication type of roles. And even though I didn’t get selected for any of the lightsaber project manager like project or product management roles I feel like, That was a good opportunity for me to to kind of explore Because honestly, The the thing is that it could the solutions architect position. That I, as I told you, I don’t know why I applied to it. At first,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You probably take to box somewhere without realising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: It was basically, I just went on the Amazon website and everything that spoke technology to me, I just signed up for that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Okay,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: so if I would have kept only to software developer and software engineer, which a lot of people do, I wouldn’t definitely missed a very, very good opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are lots of roles beside software engineering. (see section @ref(otheroles)). People think of software engineering, because that’s the most obvious route. But you mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_manager">product manager</a> there. I mean you weren’t successful in getting the product manager jobs but what is a product manager? What does a product manager do, typically, as a role?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Well. As far as yeah, as far as I’m aware, it’s I’ve done it only on a like an ad hog basis and like, My own projects but it’s it’s more about coordinating different parties in a technological project, It’s more about, not not writing code, but rather understanding how let’s say, people who do the code work, how the other other side, lLet’s say the investors or Um all the executive side of things, how like the stakeholders, how how they, like what they expect and kind of linking, all of those together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understand what’s going to be part of the product and what’s not what it’s going to do. Defining what it is that the team is building?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Yeah, it’s about thinking about the wider picture, the bigger picture, that’s something that I’ve found myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay good. So I mean, you mentioned, you mentioned you’ve been applying to software engineering position. So What was your experience of coding interviews? How did you find? Did you find those? Okay, were they difficult? Was there any particular challenges there?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Well, I was kind of lucky to have some experiencing coding because I started even like at the beginning of high school, I started doing competitive programming like, courses at school.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad">(Mathematical and Computational) Olympiads</a>, that kind of thing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Yes in C++ so I had this kind of Fundamentals that I could step on and really And really go on from there. So for example, data structures, algorithms, let’s say more than half of these things I already knew. Um, but yeah, that that helped me immensely in the in the interviewing process because a lot of people they they do <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode.com</a> and then they start from zero and it’s definitely a hard process. But for me, it was more like kind of reminding myself of the things that are kind of already knew as well as learning bit more stuff. And then, Um that’s why most of the coding interviews like the first coding interviews. I didn’t find let’s say the doing parts difficult. So kind of thinking about how to like what algorithm you need to use. I guess that the thing I found a little bit harder is the analysis of that afterwards. So let’s say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a>, the in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_complexity">space complexity</a>, Uh but do the good thing about it was that courses in computer science at Uni of Manchester do provide you I feel like with a bit of background about about those as well, so that you are able to figure that out,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how useful those kind of skills in being a solutions architect, was that important, was it kind of knowing about, you know, space and time complexity of algorithms, I’m guessing wasn’t so important as a solutions architect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Yeah, that that’s what people. People ask me all the time. Did you have a coding interview? And I’m like, no, I didn’t have a coding interview. It was networks that I got asked about. And yeah, they didn’t ask me any coding questions. So space complexity time complexity never came up in the application process or the job. Open to now, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, I’m gonna guess with that. Be different if you’d applied for pure engineering roles Amazon. If you’re apply for a pure software engineering role?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo definitely</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’d be hammered with those kinds of questions?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Oh yeah, you’ll definitely be. Yeah, as you said hammered by but it’s questions and you’d be expected to perform very well on those</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. Okay good. Um so what for you? I mean you sort of talk to a little bit about this. What do you think were the main things that you learned by your through your summer internship? What were things that you felt that you took away</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: So, to give a little bit of context, I had come from a background that was basically, way more related to startups and small companies, and I have kind of immersed myself into that kind of field. And the internship at a big corporation like Amazon gave me the opportunity to see how a big body works and why it works and what they do exactly. So this is this was I think one of the most useful things I mean, along the The usual cloud and services knowledge. Right that they inevitably teach you. But yeah, kind of looking at a wider organisation and what processes need to be in place. And it is, it is quite different from a startup, I came with a lot of presumptions things was happening that way would be way more way, more fast and then you are faced with all of these processes, lengthy processes that all you need to, I don’t know. Um, you need to To arrange a meeting with this kind of person. Oh well they’re very busy all of the time. So yeah, they say yeah, sure. I’ll schedule a meeting with you in three weeks and I’m like, <em>I’m free tomorrow</em>. So, it’s kind of a different environment but at the same time, it was extremely inspiring to see such a successful organisation? Because the first thing I notice about everything and the thing I always tell people and they when they ask me how was the work? How other people. I’m, like, the people over there, all of them have most of the qualities I would search for in a co-founder. If I had to make my own startup and that’s amazing because usually it would be extremely hard of find those kinds of people but definitely they are very skilled. But also they are very communicative. Let’s say they’re very open to feedback</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You sometimes hear the phrase <em>corporate person</em> to describe personalities. I don’t like this word but it’s quite a good word. People talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapreneurship">intrapreneurs</a>. So you have an entrepreneurial mindset but you’re working inside this massive global (corporate) organisation. But as an individual you behave, perhaps a bit more like you’ve done as a co-founder or somebody in a startup.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Definitely my project over there, The funny thing about it was that and Was that they just gave me like a random, Not random, but a very broad topic, right? To, to look and so it was basically related that they told me what can we do in terms of sustainability. Something like that. Let’s say with kind of a little bit more details but kind very, very much as broad as this. So they kind of put me in this pool of of limitless, directions and ideas where they left me kind of alone that and they wanted to see how I was behaving in that sort of environment, what I would do. The thing that they really, they’re really liked about me throughout the whole internship, is that I was able to just like an entrepreneur to have something that’s very vague, very broad and kind of get on with it, take responsibility and ownership for it and kind of arrive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, you mentioned that where that word <em>ownership</em> I think isn’t that, is that one of the <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/principles">amazon.jobs/principles</a> (see <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-amazonprinciples">Bezos 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-ameaning">E. Jones 2022</a>)</span>). Anyone I know who works has worked at Amazon, before too long, they tell me about Amazon (leadership) principles and I know ownership is one of the principles of Amazon?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Yeah,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They actually write down on paper and say yeah and then forget about, they do actually take them quite seriously in my experience?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Definitely. I was quite surprised because, yeah, I saw them and I knew that they like HR would ask me on those but I was quite surprised to learn for example, after I did the technical part of the interviewing process. So I did like a test and then we had this sort of interview where they’ll just ask me about different technical topics. After that, they told me, oh you’ve managed to go to the final round and there’s two interviews and out of the two interviews like 70, 80% of the time, we were not talking about anything technical. It was all about the leadership principles</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Oh my god, like they really value those and when you get into the company, you realise that I think even it’s documented, which leadership principle you are best at and then which one you can you can improve on but they take it really seriously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess thats been part of sort of promotion as well. They promote people based on those principles</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: definitely take them into account, really, really seriously. And then the funny thing is, as well that a lot of the people there and I kind of started doing these maybe maybe recognise it from there. It’s just in their speech. They regularly include those kinds of leadership principles. They reference back to them. So we are all like, we’re all bursting out ideas but they’re tightly put together. Um, so that we can put them into the context that we are. We are right,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>okay, good, right, That’s interesting. So learning to operate in a big corporation, probably an interesting experience. What was the most enjoyable or rewarding part of that in terms of your day-to-day work. What would you say was the most rewarding part of it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: So in my, in my opinion it was again a link back. So one part of it was linking back to the people over there, and that is very enjoyable to work with them. Because, you know, throughout work, you can you can encounter some people that let’s say, are not that open to sharing ideas or create or you critiquing their ideas, receiving feedback. Sstuff like that while in Amazon at least my experience, it was very rewarding to be kind of working with those kinds of people. By the way, it has to have to make this claim that everything that I say, right now is my own opinion and not of the of the company. Okay? I just have to say that,</p>

<div id="ivo-final" class="section level2" number="25.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">25.4</span> Final year project</h2>
<p>So fast forward then. You finish your summer internship, you come back to university. And you have a final year project, you tell us a little bit about what your final year project was and what you did?</p>
<p>So my final year projects was related to the smart grid. So this is basically a concept of the electrical grid that we currently have, but modernising it and allowing free flow, kind of information and making it more efficient basically. So in that kind of system, a lot of algorithms already developed to battle, this kind of efficiency of electricity used. And I was working on the encryption part of it like, privacy preserving. Which kind of makes it way more practical in a real environment because, you know, in the environment, everybody wants to know everybody, but there are some people that want to steal information, use it for malicious purposes and that’s what we were kind of battling.</p>
<p>Right. Okay. And was this a project, you’ve proposed yourself or is it something that you pick from the book?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: It was something that I did pick. It was a project that my supervisor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who was your supervisor?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: It was <a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/mustafa.mustafa">Mustafa Mustafa</a>. So it was quite fun working with him and I think it was quite quite interesting project to me, Good?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last bit of this is, so you are graduating in a month’s time. A bit more than the months time. When is graduation July 17th? Anyway, so you what comes next? I mean, once you’ve had a break and recovered from exams, What comes next?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: So the thing that’s surely happening is I’m going to be returning to AWS. And continuing in their graduate program but it’s actually a full-time role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So is that continuing what you did before or is it a thing where you do a rotation and you work in different parts of the organisation, common in graduate programs (see Table @ref(tab:jobterms))</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: It’s what they call the <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/AWS-TechU">Tech U</a> program. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-techu">Bezos 2023</a>)</span> Which means first six months, you are just studying about about the cloud and communicating with clients and then after this kind of training, six months. I recommended to anybody that has interest in cloud. So after these six months of training, then you go on to be integrated into an actual team that you just start full time work,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right and that’ll be in London again, I guess?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Yes. That will be in London. But yeah, that’s the more formal part of it, the work work part of it while. I’ll be constantly working on side projects. I’m thinking of more doing more kind of lecturing and speaking in the future. So, there’s a lot of exciting things going on her head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah no thanks to all the time but I thought I’d like to thank you again for the record. Thank you for coming in talking to first year because it’s quite difficult to find speak as you can engage with the audience, right You can find people to come and talk about their organisation, that’s not very hard. What’s difficult is finding somebody can talk knowledeably about an organisation but also <em>engage</em> with the audience and one thing I haven’t at the end of viewers and you had got some pictures of it, (shown in figure @ref(fig:ivotalking-fig)). There’s a big queue of people coming to speak to you after. That’s my measure of has a talk been successful? If lots of people come up with the end of talk to you, then you know you’re winning. So thanks for doing that. That was a really good talk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Yeah, I think definitely there is a need for for students because we have a lot of like we have ever more information available to us. Ever more opportunities to choose from. At the same time, it’s a matter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">Gen Z</a>, the generation I’m in, I have seen studies and I have seen for myself as well that we are, definitely not ready for this kind of information to be able to kind of crunch it and make a choice. And that’s what I find most people struggle with is that we are supposed to be more independent than ever in terms of making our own choices. But what I’ve seen is studies that people are even more getting used to, let’s say leave home later, like they rely on their parents way more in terms of financials in terms of where to live, but also in terms of like emotional support and kind of this decision making. So long story short, people don’t want to make choices. But they <em>have</em> to make a lot of choices right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s an American expression but the “fire hose”, people talk about the fire hose as just this kind of fire hose of information blasting at you about opportunities that there are things that you could do and it’s you know it’s like you’re saying you searching inside yourself as well as searching inside the fire hose it’s a big challenge I think for most people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: It’s definitely like an enormous challenge and that’s that’s the reason why I did, I think I told you this story about how I decided. Did I tell you how I decided?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, go on</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Okay, so I was just having coffee and cake with a friend of mine, we go out probably once a month or so. And he’s a good friend of mine and we were talking about just life in general. He told me you’re done for life, you got a job at Amazon because you’re like, so sort smart and a genius. And I’m like no, I am definitely not. I mean smart maybe but definitely I’m not definitely a genius. I’m not any better in terms of, let’s take technical skills than the other people. It’s just that I knew what to do or found out how to do stuff, so that I can get us a significant advantage over everybody else. And then It was like, oh really and then I looked at his CV and he had because he was studying, he studying biomed, I think or neuroscience, stuff like that. And he had worked with the professor in the lab and essays and high scores. And I was like, how are you not getting a job? And then he showed the format of his CV. I was like, okay, that’s why. And then immediately, after I went home, I remember I just wrote a one-pageer and I sent it to you. I was like, take a look at that, I’m coming to discuss it because I knew that there are a lot of people that have the qualities but they don’t know how to go about stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s how to articulate it, in a way, knowing which bits to articulate as well, what bits are relevant, what bits is a potential employer, going to be interested in ecause some of what you’ve done. Isn’t that interesting? I mean, it might be interesting to you, but it’s might not. Is it less interesting to other thing other people? But then the flip side of that is the stuff you’ve done, like this biomed guy you’re talking about, he doesn’t realise the value of what he’s done because he’s buried it in his CV somewhere or its on page two or it’s not on there at all. Like actually you need to give that a lot more emphasis because that’s really interesting. That says something about you as a person that Play will actually care about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Yeah, I think that students nowadays and I used to be like that as well. They think that if you want to get the good job or a job, or a great job that you have to be smart or a genius. All right? And that’s just less than 50% of the whole work. And yeah, the other 50% is like thinking about where are you gonna apply? How are you gonna apply? What are you gonna say on your interview? Like on your CV as well? So it’s all about those kind of little things, but they make the difference, really they did for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good, that’s good to hear. So I hope you enjoy your your job at Amazon when you start when you continue there.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">25.5</span> You are the next vice chancellor</h2>
<p>So we’ll move on to next bit, the first one is called you are the next vice chancellor. So, the vice chancellor of the University of Manchester is has been serving since what is it 2010? So after a good few years, of service, she stepping down. I want you to imagine that you are now the vice channcellor. You have responsibility for 11,000 staff, and 40,000 students, and a network of half a million alumni around the world. What you going to do, what what would be the sort of things that you do as a vice chancellor?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Whoo that that’s quite quite a big responsibility. Definitely. Um, I guess the things that I would first start to focus on is the things we’ve just talked about is just kind of kind of helping students gain that confidence and again, access to the useful resources. So everybody has access to let’s say job boards and <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a> and <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">hackerrank</a>, so they learn how to code. Um, but do things that they don’t really have access to right now is, as you said people that have already gone through the process, That can speak from experience. Employers that not only tell stuff about their company but how they actually went about, let’s say, getting the job or how they think students should go about that about about the whole process. I think in an age of so much information, there should be more, I mean, I don’t want to see forced activities but things that students need to go through. And talking with like let’s say PASS. I’m not only PASS1, PASS2. Um, And also one-to-one consultations with students or people are like recent graduates. I think it’s really like it’s the first thing that I’m gonna go about an establish,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It kind of sounds naff when you say it because it’s like people talk about networking but that’s kind of what you talking about in a way. It’s like just kind of meeting people who are different stages in their career because they can all help you. Most people are actually quite willing to help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Yeah, definitely. I’ve realised that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have to ask, right? There’s no shame in asking because what’s the worst that can happen is that they could say no, sorry</p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, most of the good opportunities that I’ve had in my life have been through. Oh, just kind of Looking looking at people and then saying, oh, I think this person might be very, very useful to me. And then the other thing is people people have this idea in there heads that they they have to look for the opportunity.They have to kind of imagine the perfect opportunity and then if they see it, they grab it. In my experience. I’ve seen that just exposing yourself and kind of putting yourself out there. Not looking or searching for specific thing. Yeah.</p>
<p>I was reading a commencement speech, you know at American graduations. They have these commencement speeches where they get a big, you know, big wigs in to come and do a talk. So it’s reading one from Bill Gates who was talking at Northern Arizona University, (see see figure @ref(fig:one2-act-fig)). One things he was saying is that, you don’t have to worry about the first step, right? Because your life is, that first step is the first act, right? So not necessarily what you’re going to be doing for the rest of your life. So, You don’t need to worry too much whether that first step is right for you. So much is just try out and see where it goes. Yeah. Was that can happen. Is that you decide? Okay, that’s not for me. I’ll try something else. Something Hmm yeah yeah definitely And I don’t know I anecdotally I see that in students making that first step is a bit scary because it feels like well, you know, if you’re going to banking says like, well I’m not sure if I want to work in banking for the rest of my life kind of thing but you know there’s no such thing as a job for life anymore. So you know, try and see what you think of it.</p>

<p>Ivo: Yeah, so as a sum up of all this as a vice chancellor, I would definitely create opportunities for people to do some networking and kind of</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you mean online networking or face to face or a bit of both?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: I mean, I guess a bit of both but I would prefer face to face because I think thats where it most naturally develops and yeah, kind of giving students that opportunity to by chance meet people and discover, oh, they’re doing something I’m very interested in. Let’s contact them, and we can, we can make something out of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Okay, good. Anything else as Vice Chancellor?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: I mean, I sort of networking. I think, quite important. But anything else. Hmm, I guess maybe a little bit more funding towards volleyball without a personal thing!</p>

<p>Is there a volleyball? So there are volleyball club a part of the students union</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Yeah but like there are quite a few and you are part of that yeah I’ve been playing for for a year now. But yeah, I feel like some sports. Let’s say that some sports, get more priority over others and I feel like</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And some universities are sportier than others as well. In the UK, you know, places like Loughborough and Bath and places like that are very sporty universities. Have amazing sporting facilities, I mean yeah you’ve had good facilities here in Manchester nor what?</p>

<p>So the subscriptions worth it.</p>

<p>And this is quite an old book, isn’t it? That’s been around for a long time, I think.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Oh yeah, definitely. Yeah. I think it was. Yeah, it’s been around for I think, yeah, at least 20 years, right? Not more, but it’s one of those kind of classics that, I mean, not, it’s what you call it non-fiction. Yeah, exactly. But it’s it’s this kind of classics in nonfiction that you can always read and you can you can always find something to learn from it and and it’s absolutely fundamental I think for everybody that’s just starting life and they want to Do life, right? If you can do that. But yeah, you can apply to various situations and it’s really useful</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">25.10</span> Advice to your former self</h2>
<p>Good. Okay. That’s how that brings us to our last question, which is time travelling you mentioned interstellar time travel so I’ve got a time travel machine here and you’re going to step on that time machine going to go back to meet yourself in first year, arriving here, in Manchester from Bulgaria. What would you tell yourself something that you’ve learnt while you’ve been here that you, perhaps wish you known when you started. So not just for you but perhaps all students.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Well because I mean personally for me I would say never go back for let’s say, a year and a half. I think for a year back in Bulgaria. Just stay there because you’re gonna learn a lot of stuff here. It’s going to be useful experience But for I guess something that could be you used in a while variety of contexts. Is mainly to to give yourself chances, give yourself more chances and <strong>don’t be too fixated on on marks</strong>. Because I used to do that a lot, especially in first year, I mean, it’s kind of natural I was very ambitious and wanted to really hammer on the grades. I wanted it like, 80% plus, but as I as I went through the university life, I found out that <strong>It’s not actually the marks that matter</strong>. It doesn’t matter as much, what do you have on your diploma? But it’s more like what you know and what you can do and the opportunities that you have here kind of, I would want to throw myself a little bit more into into the opportunities. Because uni computer science it
you need, Manchester especially, it gets tough. In year two and then it doesn’t get easier after that. So there’s definitely a lot of pressure on you at all times</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a bit of a culture change because in school you’re just you know the classic thing is you’re told it’s work hard and get good grades. And that determines what universities you can apply to and you’re either university. I think it’s like it’s almost like an algorithm people carry on while I got the best grades I could at school, so I’ll carry on doing that university and actually at university it doesn’t matter so much. I mean, it’s you need to do the best you can but like you say it’s important to kind of engage with all the other stuff that’s going around you besides the, just got to get good marks, got to get good marks,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Definitely well, especially in computer science, because I, at this point you don’t even like, sometimes you don’t even need a diploma, like I have a friend of mine, we studied together in high school. And then he like, we both went to university, but he did his own, like, he started his own startup and he’s my age. Now, having a company, a major share in a company that he founded that, that is valued to millions of dollars right now. So there’s this path as well. So I mean, I’m not saying a quit university, definitely. It’s a good idea to keep on studying, but there are also sorts of opportunities. <strong>It’s not about just getting the good marks</strong>. And but it’s about. It’s about studying and learning stuff, and then thinking about, okay, what I want to do next, If I want to do a master’s, it then PhD maybe having good marks is very much linked to me having a very, very good knowledge of the fields, then maybe go for marks, but It’s think about what you really want to do because not a lot of people go into academia and that’s for a reason. So no, I mean it’s it’s just one thing that you can do. Yeah. It’s not that you have to do this. Yeah. And it’s not even a big thing. It’s, I mean yeah, it’s a good thing. If you want to do it but then if you don’t want to do it and you didn’t try to do it, it’s gonna be a nightmare on honestly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Okay, good. Okay, okay. I think on that note will will finish up so thank you ivo for coming on the show and Good luck with whatever comes next. Well good, let with moving to London and carrying on with AWS. Yeah. And thanks again for joining us. Yeah. Thank you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivo: Thank you for inviting me. And I want to point out. Now if anybody wants that if you’re thinking about something that I’ve said in this podcast or anywhere that you’ve heard you as a listener, I would really encourage you to just write me a message (see contact details in figure @ref(fig:ivo-fig). If you want to ask about something. I’ll be very comfortable, put contact details definitely and stuff on the show notes so people have got those if they want to definitely it’s free time. You usually people pay for career consulting or stuff like that. It’s free. It’s free help. So, get look out for it, great. But yeah. Thank you again for inviting me. It’s been, thank you, good.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.1</span> What’s your story Jonathan?</h2>
<p>So let’s start the beginning and what your name and where you come from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: I’m Jonathan, born and raised in Manchester so I’m didn’t have to to come very far today. At the moment I’m in Salford so you know a little bit cheaper, what can you say?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="why-jonathan" class="section level2" number="26.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.2</span> Why study Computer Science?</h2>
<p>So you’re local and what was it that made use choose to study computer science? Can you remember was it a particular moment or was it something over time? Did you did you study it as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-level">A level</a> or as a GCSE (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education">General Certificate of Secondary Education</a>)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: So, it wasn’t one moment really where I went computer science is the thing for me. It’s something I’ve always kind of done and it was this, a sort of going into university was almost this transition from it, being a thing, I’ve done on the side as more of a hobby, like, say overengineering Excel spreadsheets that sort of thing to. Okay? Now it’s actually do it seriously, that was really the difference there and so choosing to do computer, science was just kind of this natural thing. It just made sense, it was the thing I’ve always been doing so much of anyway</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right So, I did you do computing as an A level or a GCSE? Or was it something…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: at college, I studied engineering. I went to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_technical_college">University Technical College</a> (UTC, see figure @ref(fig:utc-fig)).</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p>(ref:captionutc) A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_technical_college">University Technical College</a> (UTC) is a type of specialist secondary school in England that is led by a sponsor university and has close ties to local business and industry.

<p>Right is that the one in Salford? (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldridge_UTC@MediaCityUK">UTC Media City</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: So the one I went to was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldham">Oldham</a>, it’s now closed down. I think the students they were targeting wasn’t quite what they were they’re after because University Technical Colleges target years 10 and 11, and then in college 12 and 13. And it just didn’t quite work for them with the years 10 in 11 and it made it very difficult for them to run the college.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right? Okay, yeah. So so you arrived in Manchester, what? He graduate 2020, so you’re right in 2016? Yes, that’s right. Ancient history now going by that far but and you arrived in your first year. I think and you were saying earlier in your first year, you’ve got managed to get summer internship after your first year which is yes, pretty good going. So how did you go about getting that summer internship?</p>
</div>
<div id="jonetwork" class="section level2" number="26.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.3</span> Finding work by networking</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: So the summer internship, I was at a meetup (see figure @ref(fig:herdatamcr-fig)) and was talking to the I suppose a CEO of a startup and hit it off from there. I liked the kind of thing that they were doing. They were all about helping people find mentors and helping people get into the industry, especially people from disadvantaged backgrounds and was all about helping with that sort of stuff. And with that being the goal for <a href="https://www.my2be.com/">my2be.com</a> the company it also turned out, they were more than willing to take a risk on a student that didn’t have loads of experience to yeah, help them get that experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/herplusdatamanchester.jpeg" alt="(ref:captionherdatamcr)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:herdatamcr-fig)(ref:captionherdatamcr)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionherdatamcr) Meetups, like HER+DATA MCR, are regular events where communities meetup to discuss topics of shared interest. Speakers are often invited with free food and drink on offer afterwards to facilitate networking. Meetups are a great way to find out what’s going on a particular field of technology while building your professional network. You’ll often find them advertised on websites like meetup.com and eventbrite.com. The picture shows a screenshot from <a href="https://www.meetup.com/herplusdatamcr/">meetup.com/herplusdatamcr</a></p>
<p>I think, did they was there something where they didn’t really have? It was a sort of <em>ad hoc</em> thing. So like is a sort of the classic perhaps a hidden job, where it wasn’t. Oh, this company are looking for this student, who knows about JavaScript. It was a you bumped into somebody at a JavaScript meetup. Is that right? And then you got talking and it turns out oh actually, yeah, we’d be interested in taking on a summer student. So this kind of I thing people often say this is come there’s lots of hidden jobs out there that don’t always get advertised. (see section @ref(speculative)). It sounds like that? Is it? So potentially something that had you looked for it online. You would never have found it because it probably wasn’t advertised.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: Yeah, exactly that. Both my placement year and my summer internship, were those hidden jobs. I don’t even think that, you know, the people that were offered me the job, but actually planned to, to do so in in the first place and it’s for better or worse, one of the things you might hear a lot is that. (Sometimes) It’s <strong>WHO</strong> you know, not not <strong>WHAT</strong> you know (see section @ref(weakties)), and it’s just being in the right place the right time and making those connections and sort of being being personable and being friendly. It matters heck of a lot. Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah and just being open to bumping into people I guess because you never know. Some people have social networks that they can plug into already but quite often the people who can influence your career the most are actually people on the edge off your network that perhaps you don’t know so well or you just bumped into somewhere. So that was in first, you came back to your second year and you did. You want to do a year-long placement? Yes. From the beginning. So you kind of knew that’s what you wanted to do. But now you’ve already got somewhere internship under your belt. So what’s our place, what can you describe the journey in second years as lots of work to do in a second year and but what your journey was from the beginning of the year to then getting this placement at it was moneysupermarket.com (see figure @ref(fig:msupermarket-fig))</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

(#fig:msupermarket-fig)(ref:captionmsupermarket)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionmsupermarket) You’re SO moneysupermarket! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneysupermarket.com">Moneysupermarket.com</a> Group PLC is a British price comparison website-based business specialising in financial services. The website enables consumers to compare prices on a range of products, including energy, car insurance, home insurance, travel money, insurance, mortgages, credit cards and loans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: it was moneysupermarket. Yeah, so there was a few different places I sort of applied to in the end, choosing money supermarket, despite it not being one of the places I originally intended to apply to. One of the places was an agency and in the end, it just seems the</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Digital agency and digital marketing? There’s quite a lot of digital marketing type companies in Manchester, do you mean an agency like a recruitment agency?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: They hired, no quite contractors but would build digital products for people. I chose in the end to not, not to go with them and, and go with moneysupermarket because of the the connections that I made with them. Some of the people that are in sort of knowing a little bit more like what money supermarket was about before joining them, which I think was definitely the best idea then because if I remember correctly, a few months after there was a news article going around and this company that I was looking to apply to that, I didn’t wasn’t doing so well not too long afterwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean it’s a kind of there. That’s the startup. I’m gonna get some with the third, your summer internship, was kind of startup. That’s always a bit of a risk is now it’s exciting because you, it’s five people or whatever it is and get to learn lots, but that’s not downside of. That is sometimes it can all go a bit better. Yeah. You end up with no job. MoneySupermarket’s quite a big brand, a very professional and nice big team and you kind of get an idea of what the culture is like from meeting people before or during the interview. So what was your role at money supermarket?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: I was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android developer</a>, right? So at the time there was like this big sort of branding transition. There was a couple of apps that they were working on the same time. I think some of the work was contracted out to like a separate company but with moneysupermarket, I was one of the the in-house staff for the year helping them sort of maintain and bring new features to the current app that they sort of had front and centre. The team I was on the mobile app team, I think was around 40 people or something like that. But as far as Android developers go and there was maybe like half a dozen of us that knew Android. I think another half a dozen that focus more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS">iOS</a>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you must have learned, a hell of a lot about engineering doing live products that, it’s really important that it works well. You’ve tested all your code before it gets deployed to production, all that kind of stuff. So apart from the technical stuff, what were the main things that you felt that you learnt from doing your placement at money supermarket?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: Um, that’s an interesting one. So As far as the stuff I’d learnt, there’s so much that you can get from a particular technology or you know, thing, you’re you’re working with. That can be, that can be transferred. So, I mean, I was working on Android development at the time, I haven’t touched Android development since then. But all of the processes and we had the process, the way of working. That’s all stuff that can absolutely just be lifted and shifted and all applied somewhere else. So choosing to learn a particular framework or piece of technology, even if that piece of technology ceases to exist, it’s not wasted time. Because what tends to happen in industry, is everyone likes to reinvent the wheel, it just looks slightly different every time and so if you’ve learnt the technology, you know, years in the past you’ll find there’ll be a cycle and things will move a little bit further away from that way of working and then it’ll cycle all the way back around and you’ll have seen this thing before. And great. You’ll be able to hit the ground running with it because it’s stuff, you’ve already seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you face any obstacles in finding, you know, what was the, what was them? And it sounds like you were you were doing really well because you would some exploiting your network and putting feelers out there to try and find a meet people. But what were the did you face any barriers that were challenging in second year when you were looking for jobs and how did you overcome them?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: As far as like difficulties getting a placement, I think I face the same sort of thing about like a lot of people have where <strong>at first I was applying to a lot of places, a load of rejections and that happens. It doesn’t matter how good you are.</strong> You’re applying a place you end up getting rejected by most of them, it happens. <strong>There’s a lot of people going for the same jobs</strong> and in the end getting a job that wasn’t even advertised in the first place by going to a meetup, not particularly looking for a job but deciding, I want to get some free pizza because this meetup is offering free pizza. Student, what can I say?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Works every time!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: Absolutely. Yeah, I don’t even think, if I’m totally honest, I don’t even think I was actually paying that much attention to the talk. I was more just, I’m gonna sit here on my laptop, and I don’t know if it was university work or a side project or whatever. At times, gonna do some work on my own, and just get the pizza. And just if there’s anything interested in the talk, maybe I’ll look up and pay a little bit of attention, but yeah. In the end, it was much easier talking to people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you go on your own, or did you take to go with a with somebody? So, I mean, that’s, that’s something that’s quite can be quite daunting for students. If you’re going to a meet up, it can be sometimes a bit intimidating because you might be the least experienced person there. Even though you’ve been studying for a while, and you’ve done lots of stuff on your own. You’re, it’s sometimes a bit intimidating. Although having said that, I think those kinds of events tend to be full of quite friendly.pPersonable people so it is quite easy just to walk up to strangers and go <em>Hi, Who are you? What are you doing?</em> Kind of thing. That’s what you were doing, I guess?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: Yeah if you’re a student you are the least experienced in the room. There’s no there’s no question about that. I can still go to these events and there will be people that have been in the industry for decades and so much experience and about like up just follow some of the stuff that I talk about some of the stuff that they’ve seen. And you know, that’s all experience that can be learnt from and that’s great. It is a little bit intimidating at first and the great thing about these meetups is you can go for a little while if it’s something that’s a little bit uncomfortable. It’s okay to leave. It’s okay not for there for the full thing and it will be scary and some of them will be boring, some of them will be great and that’s fine. It happens. Turn up to one of the ones with pizza and at least you know you don’t leave with nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if you haven’t understood the talk, you could still talk to people afterwards and network of professional network that you build can be valuable that way</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: Oh absolutely. Even if it’s something that you’re not hugely interested in, there’s still so many people there that are in that are doing things much more similar to you, maybe things that much more interesting to you and so if you end up at a talk that you think is about databases and it turns out to be about data and business analysis and you realise, I’ve really ended up in the wrong like GDPR and meetup, then at least you can get your pizza. Have a look at have a couple of interesting conversations and just yeah, disappear into the background. It’s fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="jonathan-final" class="section level2" number="26.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.4</span> Final year project</h2>
<p>So that was your placement year at moneysupermarket, you came back into your final year can you remember? I know it’s two years ago now. But lots happened into this. Yeah. And can you remember what you did? What did you do for your final year project?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: Yeah, so my my final year project was um kind of an extension in a way, some of this technologies I had seen at money supermarket and not really dug my teeth into that much. I was looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> which is a way of orchestrating, a bunch of of different applications. Running simultaneously in much more of an enterprise fashion and compared to say, running a bunch of like, Java application on say like a Raspberry Pi or something like that. And the idea was to apply a lot of the stuff I got from industry and lots of that I’ve learnt from from software engineering in the second year and evaluating those technologies looking at the thing that I could build with those sorts technologies and build a like a white label e-commerce platform</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right? I suppose a nice thing about a final year project is you can you don’t have to worry too much about the customer because there isn’t one, it gets read by an academic but you can sort of just dig into stuff because it’s interesting and that’s let’s see where this goes. Let’s see what I can do with this kind of thing and so say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: it’s a safe way to take risks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And its not always possible to do that in a commercial environment because usually a customer or somebody can say can you stop working on that now and do this thing over here instead? So that’s graduation two years ago and I think you went so your way of working you way. You’re working now is where you where you work to immediately after you started university. Yes, it’s <a href="https://www.infinityworks.com/">infinityworks.com</a> where it’s can you tell us the stuff that you can talk about? So who are infinity works? See figure @ref(fig:infinityworks-fig).</p>

<p>(ref:captioninfinityworks) <a href="https://www.infinityworks.com/">infinityworks.com</a> are a digital transformation and engineering consultancy that was acquired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture">Accenture</a> in 2021.

<blockquote>
<p>Jonthan: So infinity works are now a part of Accenture. They do software consulting. So rather than explain what software consulting is maybe I’ll go through what I do there which would be similar to I suppose if someone joined So I’m basically attached to two different companies and they’ll have problems or challenges that there that they’re looking to overcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are clients of infinity works?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: Yes, exactly. So with it with a team of people from from Infinityworks, usually, sometimes it’ll be a team that’s like just infinityworks staff and it’ll be the whole team. So, of sits with the client other times, they sort of take and people’s of more as individuals or much smaller teams. Maybe like one or two people will go and sit with the client and help them develop a product to improve and tweak the ways they’re working ultimately to, to end up making more money turned up creating stuff more efficiently to to getting rid of roadblocks, that’s that sort of thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Working with people quite a lot?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: Yes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a commons misconception with computer science that you’ll just be sat there in a darkened room writing code on your own, which you can happen if you want it to. But I think it’s more common, the other way around where you’re working with people and especially in your role where you’ve got lots of different clients rather than just one client or one manager, you’ve got that variety, I guess of working with different organisations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: Mmm, absolutely. And the the coding aspects and I think this is the case of a lot of jobs. The coding aspect of the easy bit of it. And you you it might not feel like it as you go into university and you’re learning to code, but eventually you get experience with it. And it’s very easy thing to to pick up a different language or to transfer a lot of the skills you’ve already got. But what’s usually a lot harder is interacting with with clients, with customers, within a company’s as opposed to working with clients, just interacting with the wider, the wider business. Yeah <strong>the challenges that that we so often face are with people, not with computers.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, just kind of those social skills. We don’t really put much emphasis on the social stuff in computer science degree, but it obviously important like you say. So you’ve been there for two years now. I think Infinity works actually host Her Data Manchester <a href="https://www.meetup.com/herplusdatamcr/">meetup.com/herplusdatamcr/</a> and other meetups. You’re in the centre, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_Square_Manchester">Circle Square Manchester</a>?</p>
<p>yes, we are in Circle Wquare. Yeah, they recently hosted or at least sponsored, I’m not exactly sure. But there were definitely part of that her plus data, and there’s also a bunch of other meetups that they that they do. I know things have sort of over the past couple years with COVID, things have changed a little bit with what’s running and what’s not. Yeah, one of, I know one of the, the big events that I turn up to quite a lot, especially, as a student was, was the DevOps battle royale <a href="https://www.meetup.com/the-devops-battle-royale-london/">meetup.com/the-devops-battle-royale-london/</a>.</p>
<p>A challenge I guess?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: So it was comparing a bunch of different technologies and because there’s such wide variety of experience that the different consultants at infinityworks have, it’s quite easy to to sort of go. Hey, does anyone know, AWS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services">Amazon Web Services</a>), does anyone know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure">(Microsoft) Azure</a> how about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform">Google Cloud Platform</a> and go? Okay, if we compare and contrast these different technologies, I mean, how do they all stack up to each other? What can they do? Well, what do they not? And that’s ultimately what a lot of people in industry are quite interested in because if they’re looking at picking up one of these technologies, cloud providers, that sort of thing. They don’t have the luxury of loads and loads of time to really thoroughly dig into all of them. And that’s why things like the DevOps Battle Royale really help because you see a bunch of these technologies from people that have used them for for quite a while and have so much experience and then go. It’s great forum for this particular thing. But also if you’ve got another set of needs maybe this technology is better.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.5</span> Minority report</h2>
<p>So the next bit the next bit, this is called minority rerport. So I asked student, if you’re a member of a minority group that you’re happy to discuss and you mentioned one earlier?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: So it’s a weird one for me. So I’ve got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease">Crohn’s disease</a>. I’ve had Crohn’s since I was as I was 10. University is a relatively stressful thing because it’s a lot of work at the end of the day. My Crohn’s was especially difficult around then</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exam time or any stressful period is gonna make things difficult?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: Yeah and it’s the same thing with a lot of chronic illnesses, stress makes everything worse. Yeah. Even I mean if even if you’re fully healthy stress is bad, stress makes things worse. So if you’re not 100% healthy which I’m not, it exacerbates symptoms for things like Crohn’s. And I’m sure, you know, they’ll be students that are in similar situations that have got, chronic illnesses and stress is rough. This came to to a head after university, I had a flare up with my with my Crohn’s. Which, long story short, I ended up in the hospital and now I’ve got an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostomy_system">ostomy bag</a> which hopefully something that will be reversed soonish. I mean, I know the NHS are struggling at the moment with getting through to seeing people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what could universities do to make? You could have done them and I guess we would have done some things to make your life easier. But then also, what can employers do to make workplaces more welcoming to anyone with a chronic disease. You could probably include mental health (see chapter @ref(nurturing)) in that little bit as well. Anyone suffering from anxiety or depression. What what can employers and universities do to make workplaces and campuses more welcoming to people with these sorts of issues?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: The one place that I can deal with my Crohn’s the best, because I’ve got everything set up, is at home. If I’ve got a problem with my Crohns, with my ostomy bag, that’s where I want to be. And this is one of the big, The big changes that have happened since COVID is working from home, is now so much more of a thing. So if I have a problem I can deal with it like people at work won’t even realise that I’ve got an ostomy bag. I mean I’m open to talking about and that’s also if you’re comfortable like very important because companies have to go through like reasonable measures to make sure that you can work and everythings OK. So if you’re comfortable talking about those things with with the company should absolutely do so. But as far as what companies should do, it’s let people work from home and the same thing goes university. Let people study a lot more from home. And that’s, there’s not been a choice really with with COVID. It now <strong>has</strong> to all work from home.</p>

My music tastes haven’t changed much since the middle of high school. I’ve no problem admitting that and its songs like that meant a lot as everyone, you know, is going through quite difficult times. It will be no surprise to most people that are getting involved in computer science, you know, I was bullied at school that happens, you know and I think university students probably more than most will have experienced that as well. And so it was it was music that really helped me get through high school and I still listen to it now because I enjoy it.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">26.9</span> Advice to your former self</h2>
<p>So you were caught by the tail end of that a little bit. But if you could go back the first year, what would you tell your former self in order to to get the most out of your time at university? I mean I think you did a pretty good job while you were here and you made the most of lots of opportunities going and getting placements and internships. But what would you what would you tell your former self now that you’re older and wiser?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: Interesting. So with stress and an effort that university takes, I think it’s <strong>it’s really important to be to be looking after your mental health</strong>. And that goes for, for looking for, for units, to take for, making sure that your, your workload is balanced. And I think at the University of Manchester you a great job in sort of saying these units, in particular are going to be very difficult, very challenging, you’re gonna want to try and balance them out, so you definitely shouldn’t feel bad going, I’ve heard from students, maybe that this unit in particular, is a little bit easier. This is gonna help help make things sane for me at university. So, I mean, first year I did a computer science in math and end up dropping the maths</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right: Okay</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: I love it but I think it’s described to me at the time. I absolutely agree it’s 60% Computer science and 60% maths, so its a lot of work. And yeah, <strong>making sure that what you’ve got on your plate is something you can handle and at the end of the day, something you’re enjoying is really important</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, yeah. And that’s that, you know, looking looking back now.</p>
<p>Sort of I think, I mean, I see a lot of students working really hard, which is good but I think it’s sometimes it can be a little bit unhealthy. When, I’ve done it myself as well, you just work too hard, you just burn out and then things go wrong. It’s counterproductive in the longer term anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan: Yeah, at the end of the day you can make opportunities. You will find opportunities, that can happen. Even if you struggle university or it’s not quite working. But there isn’t another you. That’s really important thing to get, and that’s, you really need to do whatever. It takes, whatever you can to look after yourself, physically and mentally. It’s so important.</p>

<p>Good Well, thanks for joining us Jonathan. Thanks for coming and sharing your story. It’s good to hear about how you got to where you are now and look forward to hearing about what you get up to in the future.</p>

<p>So, welcome Alice, thank you for coming on the show. So, it’d be good to hear more about your journey from student professional. You’ve been here for four years and lots happened in four years. You’ve done a lot of things. A lot of things have happened in the world in the last four years, you’ve had your graduation yesterday. Yeah, which was very cool. And so can you tell us a little bit more about what? Let’s start with, what’s your name and where’d you come from?</p>

<p>Alice: Yes. So, hi thank you for having me. My name is actually Alexandra but I go by Alice, to not confuse people. .</p>

<p>How do I say your surname because I’ve struggled with your surname.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So it depends. So in the Romanian you have a little hat (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breve">Breve</a>) on top of the a, which is pronounced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%82">ă</a>. But the thing is, when I fill in forms or anything here, obviously I can’t put the hat on so the British version I think would be PacoRaru right okay the correct version in my opinion is Puckurado okay but it depends how you roll your R’s, there’s a bunch of things involved in it. So it go, I go by anything. When I when I hear Pac I’m like okay it’s me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re from Romania.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah really.</p>

<p>So my Romanian geography… it’s kind of a circle-ish?</p>

<div id="why-alice" class="section level2" number="27.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">27.2</span> Why study Computer Science?</h2>
<p>So can you say a little bit about what made you choose to study computer science as a thing to study for four years?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, so I’ll begin by announcing that I finished computer science with business and management and I feel the reason behind it is because I was very unsure what I wanted to study, I really liked organising, little events for my high school so I was thinking maybe business or management might be cool but then I joined the robotics club in my high school and then I was like, well, computer science, quite cool but maybe not on its own because it was an all more or less a boys club and it was robotics. So it’s a lot more hardware than I personally like and then and then I was thinking maybe I should do something completely different. I don’t know why. I have a theory that everyone at one point wants to do criminology. I’m not sure exactly what happens maybe, just because it sounds really cool. But I wanted to do that as well. And then, in the end, I decided that I want to study something that I feel is challenging for three years. Just because I had a fear of getting bored of my degree because it’s three years. It’s a lot of doing just one degree. So then I was like, you know what? I’m just gonna do computer science, seems a very challenging so for me, at least, so I’m gonna have a lot of fun and also do it with business and management just because University of Manchester, obviously, they stopped doing the course, but it was out the point where I applied one of the only, I think four or five unis …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, that’s interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That offered the course, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So had you studied computer science formally at school? Or was it something on the edges? Like you say like there was a club or something where people did stuff?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: We did study formally as well, you got to pick in high school, which part of high school, you want to do, if you want to do humanities or Sciences and in sciences, you can choose between life sciences and computer science and maths, and I just picked a computer science and maths, which is called <em>Informatics</em> in Romania, which is basically computer science. We did a little bit of coding in C++ by a little bit. I mean we were coding algorithms, but when we would ask anything further than that, it would be quite difficult for us to comprehend what was happening. Why we need class names, etc, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that’s quite a heavy (difficult) language to start with?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, we’re also doing it on paper. We did have a Informatics lab in our, and we kind of knew how to use I think we’re using code blocks, to run code, but day-to-day, just because we’re so many students, we couldn’t all fit in that lab. So we’re just coding on paper. So I feel like that’s even more difficult because then you write on paper and then the teacher needs to be like yeah. That’s not right. Checking your syntax. Yeah you can’t run in be like why the teacher needs to tell you but I think it’s really good for debugging now because then when I came to uni and then we’re doing Java, the lecturer asked us to code on paper before I never was so outraged. I was like oh this is like school. So I think it’s good. Maybe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think maybe it develops skills in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Reading">code reading</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-codereading">Spinellis 2003</a>)</span> perhaps in that you’re not computer science often focuses on <em>writing</em> code and that’s a skill you need to learn but actually <em>reading</em> other people’s code. Maybe doing it on paper helps you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, it does help because</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You think a bit more carefully about what you’re doing. You’re not just well let’s try that and see if it works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly. And it’s also, you know, when you write an algorithm and you need to check it against test cases, like in a (coding) interview, for example, it’s so it’s not about the idea they need to check. It’s about, where do you put on the paper, the variables. And then remember how they update, like, kind of having a little framework for that, that really helped me. So, yeah, that’s how I ended up in computer science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good. Okay. So, how did when you got here? How did it meet with your expectations? Was it like, okay, this is kind of what I was expecting or were there any sort of surprises where you thought? Well, this is a bit different to what I was expecting?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Well, I’d like to add the fact that I’ve never been in Manchester before coming here, for my freshers week. So expectation… Don’t know</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or the UK, I guess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Oh, I went to London once. Does that count? I don’t know. Maybe,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the UK!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, it was a holiday it was quite fun but then I came to Manchester. Everything was new to I got here a day late because I thought freshers means a week of parties, right? So I was like, oh it’s fine. I found a better flight for Tuesday so I was like, surely no one’s gonna miss me for one day? I actually missed the first lecture and my first lab. So I had to join a different lab. Okay, so I was there, I think I was in (room) LF31. And we got the little booklet with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi</a>’s. And I didn’t have a data because the data was bad and then in LF31, I didn’t know how to connect the Wi-Fi and I had to follow this little booklet and I didn’t know what a Raspberry Pi was but I was too afraid to google it because people would see my screen, it was very funny. So that was traumatic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not a great start?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah. What is funny is that I was talking to all of my other friends that weren’t really doing hardware before uni, and all of them found the same. So it’s quite funny now to kind of see how far we’ve come. So I feel like it’s also nice because now if someone that talks to a computer scientist, they expect them to know EVERYTHING. So that I’m so sorry. I don’t know how a computer works. I’m like, I don’t know either it’s fine!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Um, well, you you DO know more about it than you did four years ago?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, no, obviously I do know that, but it was quite funny. So in terms of the first day, a very intense, but then I feel like it’s good because then I had to ask questions. So I just had to be like, you know, Alice. Let’s put the ego aside, and let’s just go somewhere and beg someone to explain to me what’s happening. But in terms of the first year, I really liked it. I thought I had obviously a little bit of an advantage just because I did coding a little bit before. So, I think that was very helpful for me in the idea that it was a bit less overwhelming. I mean, obviously other friends that I know that they didn’t do any coding before I think <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/carmen">Carmen</a> mentioned it that she never did coding before coming to uni, so I’m pretty sure they handled it well, as well. I just feel like for me, it was a bit easier, just because I got time to kind of be like, at least I could show them how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">bubble sort</a> works and maybe they’ll leave me for a bit. So I found it really nice. Expectations, I didn’t have any, but I really enjoyed it but also again doing computer science with business meant that I wasn’t doing any of the hardware courses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Which I feel like my have been a bit more overwhelming for me just because I have no experience in hardware. But it was really nice. I loved the first year team project</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So fast forwarding to well. So what did you do in your first year team project? What you did you build? Can you remember? So yeah, time ago now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Oh my god. I remember it clearly. It was called unicycle and it was this app. I think someone was telling me everyone does that. Like there’s at least one team that does it. I think they were two teams and I, yeah, that did it. But we incorporated more parts of things that we felt like uni students need. Which obviously one of them was having a list of ingredients and spitting out the recipes. That’s the go-to for everyone. Yeah, I think we had another bit, which was a Google Calendar integration. Um, so you can see your classes where they are at deadlines. And then the other one was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelp">Yelp</a> API.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Where you could see the closest clubs around you, but we kind of connected all of them. So, for example, if you’re looking for club on Friday evening and you had a deadline on Monday, it wouldn’t let you because you have a deadline Monday. It was quite fun. It was really low level and but we had so much fun doing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it worked then because sometimes first year team projects go BANG, not because of technology because of politics. Just luck of the draw, which team you’re in. So your team worked well?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, I mean, I don’t think we were best friends, but we didn’t hate each other. That we were just kind of there. Like, let’s figure out. Let’s figure something out. And you, we won something as well, which is so funny. We want the most world improving idea with the recipe bit. I was like, we definitely sold it really well. Right? Because we were out there giving our body and soul to the judges, telling them how amazing and innovative idea is. So it worked out in the end. We had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Good so fast forward to second year. So this is things started happening and you were applying for placement, had you decided before that you were going to do a placement or was it something?

<p>Alice: Yeah, for me was actually one of the reasons why I wanted University of Manchester just because obviously I wanted to go abroad which is on its own a big cost for anyone coming from. Especially I feel like a country where people are less (wealthy?) than the country they are going in. So for example, from Romania to the UK, so I was kind of like a little plan. I was pitching it to my parents and I was like you support me for two years from then on I’m on my own I’ll do a little placement. I’ll put money aside, I’ll do my last two years of uni so that was the plan from the beginning and that’s why Manchester because also the people that I knew that graduated from Manchester did the same thing. They did the placement, they really liked it. So that was kind of my top choice, I think it played it big role of picking University of Manchester.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So where were you looking for jobs to do? What was your strategy did you have a strategy?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Don’t think, I’m not sure because I did the spring insights in first year. Yeah. Okay. So that would have helped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So actually for people who don’t know, what is spring insight? (See section @ref(areuexperienced))</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Oh yeah, people don’t know this stuff. True. Because that’s also that’s also another thing I found out from my PASS (Peer Assisted Study Scheme) leaders who were also my friends but they did one and they were you all need to apply because it’s so fun. It’s so important and everything. So I did the same in when I was a first year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was a JP Morgan, was it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: I was at Morgan Stanley and Barclays (see figure @ref(fig:barclays-tower-fig)). I did two of them.</p>

<p>(ref:captionbarclays) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays">Barclays</a> is a British multinational universal bank, headquartered in Canary Wharf, London, England. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en">CC-BY</a> picture of Barclays offices at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Churchill_Place">One Churchill Place</a> in London by Matt Brown on Wikimedia Commons <a href="https://w.wiki/6qK9">w.wiki/6qK9</a></p>
<p>That’s a week or two weeks, is it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah. Spring that means Easter break. So it kind of depends so it’s basically a week long or two week long mini internship, in which the company that you’re interning at just gives you a little bit of a taste of what is happening. They do a lot of really nice events for the interns. They explain what the company is doing. For banks obviously they have a <strong>lot</strong> of explaining to do because no one in computer science has a finance background. And in general I don’t think any 19 year old or first year student knows anything about banking anyway so they do a lot of explaining. They pay someone to shadow them salary as such</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They pay like accommodation and expenses? I think so addition and they feed you, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: and some companies do also pay you separately, which was really nice, you know, to kind of get my first money ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then I think the thing about that is good is then you’ve got a big name on your CV. So when you were applying for placements in your second year you had Barclays and Morgan Stanley, two big names on your CV. And say you know, even if you don’t go into banking, it’s like, well, I’ve done this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly kind of shows that you took initiative and you applied and you had to interact with people like this and you also got it. So it’s kind of like, well, definitely. They did something right. Right. But I do feel, it’s kind of a small downside just because obviously the companies that do have the means to run week long internships for students are also the bigger banks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there is (only) a few tech companies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there’s not much diversity. I’m not gonna find a startup doing a spring insight?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly. It’s mostly banks or consultancies, I think, right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But they are valuable?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, the important thing is the experience and to see how it feels just because, especially in computer science I feel like after you graduate you realise that the way that so many avenues in which we can go to but now it’s even more growing than banking and the financial bit. So I think it’s quite nice from the beginning to kind of, try out to see how it is. I personally, I do think spring insights are really important. I suggested to everyone to apply just because it’s kind of like not that many people apply obviously because you know first semester you and you don’t know what’s happening. Why I apply for internships? But there were so useful …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And relatively, I mean not easy, but <em>easier</em> if you’re applying for an internship or a permanent job, the interview might be a bit more involved. But an interview for a spring insight is probably a bit less, you know, not so difficult. Because they’re just kind of checking that you’re not crazy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, it is very much also behavioural (interview) heavy (see section @ref(hrinterview)) and I feel like it really helped me because ..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you mean by behavioural interviews, right? So they’re asking you questions and trying to find out about your personality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, and I feel like that helped me so much when I was looking to my friends that were obviously applying for placements, or after for grad jobs, They’re kind of talking like, oh, I don’t even know how to prepare for a behavioural interview, right? Because you get to second yoorur third year where you know the hard really hard bits will be the technical and you kind of like think behavioural like oh, it’s fine. I’ll just talk to them right? And because obviously, in first year, I was so panicked because I was like oh my god this is my first interview ever. I did all the prep, I would be like reading their Twitter to find cool things I can talk to them about. Reading their values, finding things that I did that match with their values. I kind of buzzword that their values</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s good, just finding out what the company does. You might be surprised, how many people turn at to interviews without <em>any</em> idea what the actual business does?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when they’re asked a question like <em>So what are our values?</em> It kind of doesn’t look very good if the candidate goes: <em>I don’t know.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what do we do? What are our products? Don’t know, But it’s not difficult to find to prepare for those kind of questions?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: But for like it’s also, Um, I feel like it’s also really important because you kind of figure out how the company is as well</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The culture?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: which initially, I thought like, oh, you know, I just want a job. I don’t really care if I match the culture, you know, I’ll see how it is and <strong>I’ll</strong> match it but then I realise it matters so much. Also, by doing the spring insight, I realised what type of companies I would be a good fit to. It’s the idea not that I’d be miserable by that job. It’s just they have better people to hire that match their company and the type of work ethic that they have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you wouldn’t have you didn’t feel like you would have fit well into that corporate banking world?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, exactly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because you see and you learn lots and you get some names on your CV. You actually think, OK, Thanks but no thanks!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly, actually really obviously, I still enjoyed that, I think so after I did a summer internship with Barclays, which they offered right after the spring insight, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that’s what seem to be as kind of like, almost like a week-long job interview. Some of them are they’re looking for summer interns. If you do well in the spring insight then they’ll say hey why not come and do a summer intern?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly and after the summer internships they’re like oh why not a grad scheme?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you did a summer internship? But hang on so you’ve done quite a lot of things here, so you did a spring insight at Morgan Stanley AND Barclays and then you just summer internship at the end of your first year?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yes. Oh no. At the end of my second year. They offer you for because it’s kind of like oh in first day you do a spring inside and between second and third year, you did summer internship and then in third year after that you come to the company, right? Obviously what they didn’t know was that I wanted to do a placement, I also ignored it for my CV for that one. I was like, oh yeah, sure, give me a summer internship. It’s fine. Yeah. No. I think it was really nice. Another thing, I really enjoyed the summer internship at Barclays as well. I did it in technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where were you was this remote this was just after the pandemic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah at the end of your second year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so the other elephant in the room here, it started nicely your second year and then it all went, I mean COVID-shaped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: It started nicely then the amount of deadlines and applications I was doing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: I feel like it was nice in the idea that, you know, in second year you have your first year kind of side meeting people not necessarily a group based on meeting people. Then in second years, almost like this. It’s, I don’t know. It’s I feel like in the first weeks, it was really relaxing, right? Because the first weeks before all kind of like waiting for the deadlines to come and it’s quite nice because you start making friends better. You start helping each other with coursework which is nice, but then then the applications for jobs start hitting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do you balance that? Because you’ve got a demanding workload and you’re also trying to apply for jobs. So, how did you navigate that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: I personally think I didn’t balance it very Well,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kind of staying up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, I was kind of like, brute force. You know, let’s see what we’re doing today, but I think the problem is, I, I remember in second year, it was when most of the the lecturers started talking about, maybe <strong>don’t expect a hundred percent for your coursework</strong> just because obviously the teachers start talking to you about not expecting a hundred percent for every coursework which obviously you don’t get a hundred percent in first year either, but you do get quite good grades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this a Romanian thing? Different countries have different cultures (when it comes to grading), you could get 10 out 10 or something.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah. But then, I don’t think it’s that, but obviously there’s a little problem with the grade inflation, right? Because you don’t want to give 10 to everyone, but I found it so weird in the UK, but I don’t think it’s gonna say UK I think it’s also like an academia thing. People are like, oh 100%, that’s for no one. Like, no one. You’re going 100%. And I’m like, then why have it? You know? But obviously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there was a student yesterday who got an award for an average of 91%, which is super high. I know. I know, you know, that that was exactly I was like, but that’s that’s that’s impressive. While we’re talking about that you want a prize, didn’t you? So can you say a little bit about the prize that you want at graduation yesterday?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yes. So, it was really sweet I got the <a href="https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/assessment/prizes/">head of department award</a>. This head of department award is given I think, to maximum 5 students a year. I was reading or for I think four of us got something like that, so it was Carmen, Shino and Rin I believe. If I hope I’m not missing anyone. W we got the award for all the work that we did throughout the years in the life of the Department of Computer Science which was really sweet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I think I was that was really important, that’s always a really important thing because and especially during coronavirus because everyone’s had a horrible time, you know, students and staff alike and keeping that community through PASS and other stuff has been really important to people. I think and not everyone needs it, not everyone wants it but the people that do need it and want it, find it really valuable. So it’s I think it’s really important what you you and the rest of the team have done with that. Important stuff. Now we’re going back. So we’re going back to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: what we were talking about?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jobs, so yeah. Second year balancing, your applying for placements and your, your applying for lots of things exactly working. Very hard on lots of things. So when did things start to happen, so I guess, at that time there would have been hiring freezes coming in of companies saying, oh, actually, you know what, we’re not gonna do placements because of COVID. Or we’re not sure we don’t know yet. So when did you get what point in the year did you get your placement?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah. So the pandemic started in March, right? I mean well you know like the lockdown restrictions and everything around end of March. I so I started applying in September. I started applying for jobs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’d been doing face-to-face interviews?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: I’ve been doing a couple of face to fit. I don’t think I did that many another thing because of the spring insights, I started being a bit more picky with my internships. Obviously, this is a very risky approach I believe. Because I was talking to people that were like, oh yeah, I just applied to 500 interviews. I’m like, I don’t want to work at those companies, so I’m not gonna apply to them. But my tactic was, I’m gonna apply to the big banks which I know I don’t want to do an internship</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get the practice?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, exactly. To get the practice because I cannot for the life of me, make myself do leetcode (see section @ref(leetcode)), or to do hackerrank. I just cannot do it. I don’t know why I’ll start doing it and then it doesn’t work out and I’m like, you know, what, in the interview I’ll just figure out. So, I was like, let’s just give myself an extra incentive and actually I show up in London at an interview and talk to the person, surely that will make me do a little bit of leetcode, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. And I think it’s good to practice. I mean, you can practice standard interview questions in front of a mirror but then that will help a little bit but actually the only way to get good at doing interviews is to DO them</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: yes,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you don’t really want that first interview to be that job that you <em>really</em> want with a company that you really love.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: You want some try-ons</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You want to get a bit of practise first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: it also depends so much on the vibes. I decided, in computer science even though technical interviews and coding, it depends so much on the vibes. I feel like that’s very unprofessional (thing) to say, but I have been so many moments in which I felt like making a mistake in the code was, oh my god. This person should me now. It’s gone. It’s gone, it’s fine. And then other moments in which I’d make a mistake in the interview would be so helpful to like guide me. That at the end of the interview, I’d be like, oh I think it was really good that I made the mistake because then they they saw how well I react to the little hint that they gave me and then I figured out in the end so things like this, I feel like you only get through practice right. You can’t really do leetcode on your own and talk to yourself in front of a mirror. Even if you do it with a friend I feel like behavioral (interviews) is really nice to do with friends but I feel like technical ones, I don’t I just can’t do it with friends. I was just like giggling</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So interviews, we’re in to March. The pandemic has hit everything’s online. You’re doing interviews via zoom. I guess actually</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: so yeah, sorry that’s why I want to say. So I started applying to the big companies in the first semester right before Christmas. It’s got a bit stressful because it wouldn’t work out, and those companies wouldn’t hire me. I know I got, oh my god. I’m not gonna say the name. I know it’s not allowed to say the name, but I was interviewing at this really big investment bank. I thought I was doing a good job at the technical interview. I thought I was doing a too good of a job because he was asking me very obscure questions of Java that I somehow remembered. And then the next question was, who’s the CEO of the company?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the middle of the technical interview?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: No, I think it was also at the end, I was like, at that point I was a bit like cocky. I was like, oh my god, I know this. And then the next question, who’s the CEO of the company? The funny thing is, I just came from a room with 200 posters of that, man. Obviously, it was a man, right? And I was just looking at him and I started doing this monologue about how I don’t care about men in power. So I don’t know his name, but it doesn’t matter that, I don’t know, It was, it was really bad. So yeah, things like this happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good interviewer will ask you difficult questions, but sometimes there’s a bit of a power imbalance and sometimes people ask you a nasty question, just because they can and they want to see you suffer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly. So that’s happened.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think guess that’s probably happened to you, maybe. I mean, that sounds a bit like that in somebody is just gonna ask a nasty question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, I just like to treat it as, you know, like nasty, a question actually, who’s a CEO should have been telling the people licence. Then I was like, by the way, just researching the CEO just do yourself a favour and just know the name. You don’t need to know what he’s doing, but just know the name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Know one product, and one service that the company makes and then..</p>

<div id="alice-thg" class="section level2" number="27.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">27.4</span> THG.com</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: But yeah, so I was in these interviews. I didn’t manage to get a job by Christmas, which was really stressful because all of my, most of my friends, got their jobs by Christmas. So it wasn’t necessarily. I knew there were other companies that would hire, it’s just because my friends got the jobs already. I was a bit like, always how much a bit alone in this now, after Christmas, I did some more interviews actually. I think my interview because I did my place at the Hut Group (<a href="https://www.thg.com/">THG.com</a>, see figure @ref(fig:thg-fig)) in Manchester, oh, to be fair. It was remote. But, you know, it was supposed to be a Manchester. When did that in, when did it offer come through? So, the interview happened in February, it was also online because they were really quick to react to like with restrictions, they were like sorry we’re not letting anyone in our offices. We’re doing it online. I was like, okay, sure. So it was still online the interview and they sent me the off I think that day after. So it’s like beginning of February.</p>

In 2017, The Hut Group was valued at more than £2.5 billion making it one of the most valuable private companies in the United Kingdom, and one of the UK’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">unicorn companies</a>.

<p>That was it, you like great! I’ve got a job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly. That was like, I can relax, but then the stress came with when the pandemic hit, probably when the lockdown started there were so many companies that were cancelling, their placements, and their internships. So, we got updated quite constantly. Barclays, like it’s fine, we’re still doing it, its probably remote. I was like great. But then the placement they were quite quiet for a while but in the end. Yeah. In the end. It was just quite in general. I think there were a lot to think to handle, but they’re like, you know, it’s it’s fine. We’ll still see you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for people who don’t know the Hut Group, well, they used to be called the Hut Group, they are called THG now. So what do THG do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: So I like to answer this question truly, they’re doing a little thing at throughout the whole placement I was figuring out what they were doing. I think to the core that in e-commerce company. So they basically handling the website of e-commerce websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it was a little logistics in the background. Yeah, warehouses, yeah. With robots and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly. They do the warehouses bit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fulfilment they would call it. Amazon call it fulfilment. It sounds great doesn’t it, the fulfilment centre? Yeah, you could be fulfilled!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: The intelligence that comes with it, but I was working on, oh my god, actually loved it, I was working on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influencer_marketing">influencer platform</a>. So what they would basically do besides the e-commerce bit, they would also create their own products that the e-commerce companies need. One of the were the influencer platform. So it’s kind of like a platform to handle influencers and pay them and talk to them and whatever</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_YouTubers">YouTubers</a>? People flogging stuff on Twitter and Instagram?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly and TikTok. I think I’m not sure, right? But it was it was really nice. I actually loved it because it was quite funny. I came into the company. So at that time, right, I did, my summer internship at Barclays but I didn’t do it in coding. It was kind of like, technology analyst I think was called, it was really sweet. I had such a good time that it was just I realised it’s not really for me. Although the older people are very sweet. It’s just, I don’t know. I didn’t fit perfectly in that company. So I had a little bit of confidence in the sense that I knew how to chat to people. I was like, it’s fine. I was here for like, 10 weeks. I might I’m here now for, yeah, it’s gonna be fine. But I started coding and obviously was a bit of a shock for me because because of the pandemic, obviously the university kind of reacted we don’t really need your grades for second year, so it’s fine. You don’t need to do the exams. Do you actually think I was coding in my free time during the pandemic? Not really! I was kind of doing yoga and chilling in the house reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it kind of got out practise. Yeah, I got out probably a little bit having to do algorithms again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly. And not even algorithms because I started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend">front end</a> so I just not anything, I just knew a little bit of HTML that was it and we started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(software)">React</a>. So I was a little bit scared but the funny thing is that because it was a influencer platform, I was the youngest there I was also I’m pretty sure the one that spent the most time on Instagram. So all of the questions about APIs and kind of talking about how to even system questions at one point, I would just find myself chatting, even though first months through meetings just because I would know these the difference between the views for a real and opposed and what it means to add a sound on and copyrights and everything just because I was on Instagram. Also I really liked my project so I had a really good time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Were you working on the influencer platform for the whole 12 months or did you rotate? Sometimes you do a rotation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: I think I don’t know if they do rotations at THG. As fair as I’m concerned because they didn’t have time. But I did the rotation the way that I thought I were front and thinking I want to do just front end and I started doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend">back end</a> and then eventually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack">full-stack</a>. So it’s like rotation within the team. It was really sweet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any preference for backend or front, or do you like doing both?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: I really like doing front-end in general but it just annoys me so much. The idea that you can’t finish a feature on its own, usually like a bigger one, just because you need the backend work as well and also I feel like I’ve applied more knowledge I had from uni in backhand it kind of feels nice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s not a huge amount of front-end stuff, there’s a little bit, you do a bit in the first year team project. And then you may or may not build a fairly big front-end for that, but it’s mostly there’s mostly back end</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: it makes sense because front-end technology changes so much and it’s so dependant on the language that we use, Whereas obviously, I didn’t use, I didn’t use the backend that I did in software engineering is just the algorithms were there. So I could remember like a little sorting function that I could put in and that worked regardless of the language or the framework that we used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I guess, I mean, would you say that front end stuff is relatively easy to pick up or not? I mean, if you like if you’ve not done any react but you know a little bit of I know basic HTML and CSS, for example. How easy is it to pick up React?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: I think, I think it’s easy to pick up. I just think it’s hard to DO. You can get into it quickly but then I would quickly realise how bad my code from the beginning was. You pick it up and if you don’t do it properly, you’re probably not going to be that good at it and you’re not gonna be able to do that many things with it. But obviously it’s easy to pick up in the sense that you can do something simple quite quickly. Yeah so that that’s always nice. Obviously in back end you need you can’t really do something easy or maybe yeah you can make it more efficient etc but you soon need a LOT of knowledge to even get the first part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay good. So, we’ve talked about this a little bit but the were there are many other obstacles that you faced in finding employment? I think we talked about most of them. Were there any anything else that we haven’t mentioned about your struggle to find a job?</p>
</div>
<div id="alice-struggle" class="section level2" number="27.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">27.5</span> Job struggles</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: I feel like the main struggle was to find a job that matched what I needed from a placement. I’ve liked a lot easier to find companies that you like that do grad schemes, just because in the worst case scenario just apply for an entry level job, whereas having a placement, there’s so many types of placements, right? There is the three-month placement. Six months placement finding one company was quite limiting choices. So that kind of raised the bar with the interviews and it was a bit more stress involved, but I think the main one was just kind of juggling everything and preparing for interviews. There were kind of the first technical interviews I’ve done as well so it was that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we’ve got a couple of things here. what were the main things you learnt, would you say what the main things you learned from doing your year in industry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: I’ve decided, because I was talking to this with a lot of people that did placement in general, I think the main thing that I learnt was to be more confident. Confident in the sense not necessarily to speak in a meeting. Although obviously that’s also really helpful. confident in the way that when someone comes with an issue, I don’t panic. If I don’t know it straight away it’s kind of like someone tells me oh can you do this by as soon as possible and then I’m not like, oh my god, I don’t know this language, I don’t know what this word means. I’ve never heard of it in my life. It’s kind of like always fine. I’ll figure out, I’ll google it. I’ll ask someone, it’s kind of like having so many moments, which you don’t know what is happening and having to force yourself to learn about it and to google it and then you somehow finish it right. I think it’s really useful because in uni, when this happens, which is also roughly at the beginning of every single course, and module, you still get a little bit of guidance. So you’re expected to know some things from before. I feel like when people give you a job, something they’re not necessarily like oh you should know this. It’s kind of like, can you please figure out and do something for me? So I feel like confidence came to it and it also applied to a lot of things, right? Like if someone would ask me to help them with an interview or to finish a project or to apply to a company or whatever it was kind of like I don’t know what’s happening, but I’ll figure out in the end.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">27.6</span> Final year project: Coding their Future</h2>
<p>So let’s move on to final year a project. So you’ve done your placement, you’ve come back to university and things were returning to normal at this point so you’ve done the entirety of your placement online?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah. Except the end right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so you did finally get to actually meet the people that you were working and that must have been good, I guess, but kind of at the same time a little bit crazy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: it was kind of really weird just because I got used to staying in the house and having snacks all the time next to me. And then, if you like being after being one year at home and your own comfort, like if you want to just call someone or to clean your oven, in the middle of the day, you can just take 10 minutes and it’s done. However, then when I had in those Fridays to go to work, I was like what if I’m very thirsty? I kind of lost all social connection anyway, it was fine though. It was fun. Yeah, good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So back to university things were returning to normal and what was your what was your final year project. Yeah for our listeners. Can you explain what you did?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: My final year project was called <em><a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/coding-their-future">Coding their Future</a></em> and my tutor was you. And for my final year project, I basically helped and supported teaching computer science with a secondary school in Greater Manchester. So I feel like it’s quite open-ended which are quite liked and the idea that we could figure out what we wanted to do after talking to the teacher, who would be like providing them with an application that would help them or teaching literally every single week to the kids or doing a couple of one-off teaching sessions with the students. So it was really nice. It was really nice. In general, the aspect of being able to kind of use my third year project and actually help someone just because I obviously third year projects have really nice or some of the titles on that list when you have to select that are really flashy and sound really cool but in the end I was kind of like if I do have a year. I mean yeah a couple of months and I can do something I might as well kind of use what I know to just help someone and I’ve like education is really rewarding in that sense because you can genuinely, it’s quite dramatic to say change someone’s. I’ve probably I didn’t change anyone’s lives but it’s just like kind of help star. Some, you dance towards them which is something that is very dear to my heart especially for women in STEM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we should say the school is Fairfield high school for girls. Yes. In a state school in Droylsden Manchester and we need to, We need to acknowledge Mrs. Roland, don’t we? Because Mrs, Rowland is amazing. She’s been that hosting students for the last. I think it’s about eight years now. Like, yourself. And I think the interesting thing about school is because it’s a single sex school, they don’t have this thing of some schools have a thing like where all computer science is for boys. Yeah. Or the girls will be put off it because there’s not a good gender balance in the classroom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly that. Yeah, that, that is clearly a big problem and Miss Rowland was absolutely amazing. And in general, I think it’s so good. She was always saying how amazing it is to kind of bring students in the like universities students in the classroom, just because it kind of gives them a better incentive and creates a different dynamic in school. It makes it even more exciting and interesting for the students to find out more about computer science. So, she’s truly amazing for being able to do this when general teaching,teachers are amazing in general because it’s so difficult and you’re a role model in a way that a teacher. I mean a teacher is a role model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re a role model in the sense that you’re somebody who’s worked as a software engineer. So they can see oh that’s, you know, that that’s a possible thing to do. Yeah, exactly. It’s kind of like someplace like maybe go and they might not think that straight away. Yeah. But they might maybe later on they’ll think oh yeah. I remember, I remember doing that school and yeah, it was that it might sometimes it takes a long time for those seeds that you’ve planted to germinate. It might be quite a lot later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah. And I know I think I was alright so I did a format, the end to kind of ask the students questions. And one of the question was, if you know anyone that works in technology, I didn’t even put, you know, something programmable web, it’s just in general technology. And I think most of them probably around 70% or something like that. Didn’t know anyone or the ones that didn’t know</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You asked them to name women who work in technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah. And there’s some of them course, obviously they wouldn’t. They probably didn’t read the question properly, but it was kind of like obvious. I feel like they still kind of had this impression that in the end society gives you that science and stem and specifically computer science for men. But I feel like given the fact that they didn’t know anyone that worked in the environment, the fact that they got not only to meet Mr Roland who’s teaching the subject and I think it’s so she’s teaching it really well. So it’s very important for them to kind of have her as a figure that’s always been important to just get to know me because it’s kind of like if they do think about software engineering or about computer science. They’ll be like, oh yeah. I had this random university student show up to my class a couple of times and she was a girl, and she seemed quite nice hopefully. So I think it was quite important in that sense. Just because it kind of like most of them didn’t even have an intersection with the subject</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think especially in secondary school, your role is much broader than just hey, here’s some subject knowledge for you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah. Exactly learning. Because it’s part of a whole social system where. Yeah, and I was actually working. Oh does class. I was working with with Mr. Rowland, we’re kind of decided that we want to focus on in explaining to them the importance of computer science in general in life. Just because by that time most of them it’s just doesn’t feel nice to kind of push towards a computer science degree someone that you can clearly see they just don’t like it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s not the goal anyway, you don’t have that objective to get them all to become computer scientists, the same way as you learn English and maths, you know, just because you need those things in life. Whatever you end up doing, hmm, it’s important that, you know, this stuff</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: exactly. So I was really nice to talk to them about the main topic that everyone liked and enjoyed and the one that connected us the most was TikTok, right? It’s just talking about TikTok or the time I used to love saying on TikTok and say it’s for <em>research purposes</em>, but I’d stay on TikTok. And I remember I was trying to exp them the concept of (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system">recommender system</a>) algorithms, right? So it’s kind of like TikTok has this algorithm which obviously, again, it should be common knowledge because there’s so many issues that comes with having this algorithm. Oh my goodness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What it shows you, when and why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: I heard about an increase of kids, having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourette_syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a> ticks, just because that obviously some really nice content creators on TikTok that have to write. And they just obviously just share with the world about it, which is really nice. They raise awareness, they have a lot of fans is really create a community around it but because some some people that will perceive, I don’t know like easily impressionable. A lot of teenagers are in general. They would just start grabbing on even like these little ticks which in the end not life-threatening, right? But it’s kind of to show how much impact TikTok and that the TikToks algorithm in general, social media algorithm has on the brain. Because if you get, if you see something every single day, you create yourself this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">(filter) bubble</a>, which obviously the students didn’t know about. right they are what 12?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: They don’t get to know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">social media bubbles</a> but they use social media. So we’re talking about kind of this, I kind of mentioned a little bit about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image">body image</a> issues just because there were at the age in which was really easy to think that everyone looks like the Instagram influencers or in that situation TikTok influencers. And then I think I mentioned briefly, like I was giving an example about like, a very simple way of how the algorithm works. And I was like, you know, if you’re a dog person, you’re most likely to stay on videos that have dogs like to watch them or to like them or to share them. So then TikTok learns quickly, right? That you like dogs, and not cats that much. So a dog person TikTok is different than cats person TikToks. But then I mentioned you know, I never have dancing videos on TikTok and the girls were so shocked. They were like, what do you mean? You’ve never seen the dancing video and TikTok and I was like, I have no idea why people I’ve never seen a man woman or a person in general dancing on TikTok. And I think I had to literally open my TikTok and scroll with them for, like, two minutes because it wouldn’t believe me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: And I was like, see this is how the algorithm works. My algorithm (output) is different than yours. So it was really sweet chatting. A lot ended up for my project doing a couple of games and applications for the kids to kind of figure out the basics of computer science and apply them in different situations. I think the one that I create like I did with Mr. Rowland’s after a little brainstorming session was about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle">Wordle</a>. Oh really liked it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit of algorithm stuff?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, I was kind of like walking through the algorithm of wordle and figuring out. It was really nice. Really rewarding and I absolutely loved it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great. Okay, so the next bit is what comes next. So what, what are your plans for the future? You can say as much, or as little as you are making, maybe your plans are still up in the air and you haven’t decided yet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: they’re not up in the air. The thing with jobs, which I’ll never understand is, I never know how much you can say about them. So at the end of each interview, each internship, I’d be like, right? So, if like, I’ll take my manager to the side, I’ll be like, right? You tell me now, what am I allowed to say? Because obviously, like, if you code something, you can’t really tell them the codebase, right? Someone asks, but I’m pretty sure no-one told me not to say, well, I’m going to work at a consultancy company in London, right? I’m going to be a software engineer, junior software engineer. So I’m really excited because I’m moving to London and a lot of my friends are moving to London, which is really exciting as well. And that is what I have planned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s the name? Would you rather not say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: It’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicis_Sapient">Publicis Sapient</a> (see figure @ref(fig:sapient-fig))</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p>So that’s exciting is really exciting. These moving to London because you, because I, because you’ve been in Manchester for four years now, haven’t you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah. Doing my placement as well. I really wanted to go to London during my placement, obviously, in the end, it ended up fine right as well. I’ve been remote, but I, I’m really excited. It feels weird to leave Manchester. Now for my graduation, that I came here and I couldn’t live in my flat, and I had to get a hotel and move around. It felt so weird, but yeah, moving to London, good.</p>

<div id="alice-minority" class="section level2" number="27.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">27.7</span> Minority report</h2>
<p>Okay, well, good luck with that wish you all the best, and so, there’s a few other things, a few other things left is so one of them is minority report. So, I asked people, if they identify as being a member of a minority group, we’ve talked about a bit about women in computing. So I guess that’s one minority group that we can talk about. So we, I think our stats are in Manchester out of about 1300 undergraduate students.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About 20% of them, are female. It’s not ideal. Obviously 50% would be better but we’re not there yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so, what’s your experience being of that and in the workplace as well. So and what can, what can universities and employers do to make campuses and workplaces more welcoming to women?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Well, I think my experience is quite different than someone that for example would have grown up in the UK and went to uni here, I think we were talking about stats when we did that little women in STEM event in the Kilburn building. We’re talking about stats in different countries and I think Romania is quite good with stats in terms of women in computing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you take informatics for example yeah, your informatics class at high school</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: was mostly girls because I don’t know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was just an anomaly of your school?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Most of the really top, I don’t want to call super top but like a couple of the top scores in terms of like the grade you need to enter in high school because we do a little exam. It’s kind of like GCSE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it’s like a sixth form school that you go from age 16 to 18?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: No, before 14. So 15 to 18. So you have some kind of entrance exam but exactly basically at the age of 14. Yeah. I don’t know how I, but some some of the top schools in terms of grade because I can’t speak in terms of, like, if they have good results or not, I didn’t look, would be mostly girls so automatically the people that would go into the classes of informatics and Mathematics would be also more mostly girls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So your fellow students on that. I mean, I guess you’re still in touch or you know, about some. Yeah. What sort of what sort of things did they go on?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: I do, I do have plenty of female friends that went computer science and also, you know, applying in general like making the decision. They want to go to a computer science university, kind of like nicer when you know that friend. There’s also like we didn’t really start talking about the gender imbalance when we were in high school just because we didn’t have to just because we didn’t feel like it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn’t an issue?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Obviously, I came here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was that not a shock then? So, you’ve gone from an environment where there is no gender imbalance and then all the sudden it’s switched and you’re in an environment which is very male-dominated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly. It was, it was really, I don’t think I picked it up initially, I made a couple of friends where everything was fine. I started noticing, I think all female events and computer science and I thought I was like, oh, that’s interesting, why did they need that? I mean, obviously I knew that there weren’t that many women in computer science but I was like why would you need more events? And then I started kind of like understanding how I feel like after doing like groupwork and everything and kind of like seeing that there are little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression">microaggressions</a> that people do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Carmen (see chapter @ref(carmen)) was talking about this and we didn’t really explore. Can you explain what a microaggression is? See figure @ref(fig:microagression-fig).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p class="caption">
(#fig:microagression-fig)(ref:captionmicroaggression)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionmicroaggression) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression">Microaggressions</a> are something that somebody says to you; they can be a way that you’ve been made to feel. They are often subtle behaviours, but their effects are far from subtle. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-microaggression">Hollowood 2022</a>)</span> Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en">BY-SA</a> licensed picture of aggressive teeth-bearing behaviour in a domestic dog by Samasjamas on Wikimedia Commons <a href="https://w.wiki/6qJ6">w.wiki/6qJ6</a></p>
<p>So perhaps give an example?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, I don’t know that this might be wrong. I’m gonna say that first. But what hands from microaggression, I think what I think is it’s kind of like when someone does something that they don’t think is inherently aggressive, or racist, or sexist, or whatever towards a person. But obviously, if you think about the reason why they did it, it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It <em>seems</em> innocuous. You might initially think it’s innocuous and it’s not until afterwards. You think that was not a minute? Yeah, I was out of order. Yeah, I yeah. Happen again.</p>
<p>I discovered all of these micro aggressions more I feel like my final year just because in my final years when I started hanging out, I feel like in my first two years it would be like me with one or two friends, right? So it would be like us against computer science, I guess, but in my final year I started staying more in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilburn_Building">Kilburn (building)</a> obviously with my third year project and I think it was also after COVID, we wanted we wanted to be yeah I’m being a PASS leader that we want to be in Kilburn more just because we’ve been apart for such a long time. I’ve started hanging out more with females and we started talking more about things that would happen and then I would realise some things would be microaggressions while talking to them.</p>
<p>So, can you give an example that you’re comfortable talking about?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: No, I’m making myself comfortable talking about it. I feel like it’s very important to just chat about things like this. I think that most important one would be, I think, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining">mansplaining</a> which is a very delicate topic (see figure @ref(fig:mansplaining-fig)), just because some people genuinely explain in the rude, way to everyone, it’s not necessarily that they explain. So mansplaining being like a man explaining to someone, I think the word itself is to a female usually or someone that identifies a female.</p>

<p>(ref:captionmansplaining) When a man comments on or explains something to a woman in a condescending, overconfident, inaccurate or oversimplified manner, that’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining">mansplaining</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, it’s kind of like, oh let me explain to you about why your computer does this. And I’m like, thank you, I wrote the program, I know why. So obviously it’s quite a fine line, right? Because sometimes you don’t know what the other person knows, etc. That a lot of grey areas. However, sometimes like clear mansplaining and initially, I just used to kind of ignoring and be, like it’s fine. Just because I kind of like society kind of made that acceptable for mansplaining to happen and no one really questions it. But while talking to the girls, I’d be like, oh my god, that WAS mansplaining! I started calling out people on it. It’s quite funny, actually. I don’t know if it’s rude or not, but I just call them out just because I feel like it’s nice. And then for them to know,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you were a man doing that, you’d be called assertive, right? But if you’re a woman doing that, you might be called something not very nice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, exactly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Standing your ground. I’m not gonna let you do that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly. So I feel like it was quite useful in the idea that just talking about, it was very important. I also noticed doing PASS and everything and talking to other also doing. That’s why we started running the women in computer science, little pop-up events, I can call them just because we realised that just sometimes girls just don’t know. So if you hear a story, you’ll be like, oh, that happened to me. That wasn’t nice just because by when microaggressions happen, I feel like they also make you feel a bit little but you don’t understand why, and you think it’s normal. You think maybe it’s because of you, you think it’s your fault they didn’t know those things before or because you didn’t seem like you knew this those things before. So yeah, microaggressions definitely happened. What was the question?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how to make campuses and workplaces better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Oh, it did many things happen that work, I feel like it’s a bit more, I think it was a bit more obvious at work just because obviously in computer science you interact with a lot of people, every day, 20% of them are girls. I feel like the stats were a bit worse at work, but also, because you were, you were supposed to be in the same team all the time, right? You weren’t also with COVID, you wouldn’t really interact with anyone else. You would have your little team, the teams group chat and that would be it. So it was just me and one other girl and loads of men basically. And it was fine, it was absolutely fine but it’s just kind of you wouldn’t necessarily have space to talk about some things or I feel like it would be more important for workspaces in universities in general to have open conversations about it. I also remember when we were talking because obviously in our group, we would start talking about this as the girls or complain about something and sometimes like one of the boys with us. Oh, I really know that would happen. Like I didn’t know in any shape or form that that can happen to you just because I don’t know, we may be overreacted at a joke that they made, which was intended to be a joke, and they wouldn’t understand why and we started to explain to them what that joke meant to us. And why it’s so stressful and so touchy. And why we’re so touchy on the subject and feel like I’m so sorry. I did know that and it’s kind of like the problem is that they didn’t know that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. Yeah. So talking about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: everyone’s more aware of what. Exactly some of the issues are, I do feel like we’re not necessing this place maybe to talk about it. I know we’re talking with the girls, doing the women in tech event for we’re kind of like, sharing experiences giving advice and at one point we were talking about, do we want to have almost a lecture when we invite men as well or everyone basically to attend to kind of explain because I feel like if they would know what women or anyone that’s not man or fits the stereotype of a white man and can be a science has to go through. Maybe they’ll be more it’ll be more easier for them to empathise with everyone else. But then it was kind of like the issue of, Is it your job and duty to use time and resources? Like, obviously, some people like that, right? And I personally like talking about it and talking in PASS and talking to other people, but it’s not necessarily just because you’re a woman doesn’t need You need to talk about an educate, everyone else around you because sometimes you just don’t have time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s exhausting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Sometimes you’re exhausted. Sometimes why do I need to teach you how terrible it is? Just try to like be a bit more aware, so I feel like it’s a bit of a double-edged sword in that you want to educate people, but sometimes you just don’t have time and resources to do it. So yeah. I’m pretty sure universities would sort it out though because they’re quite good with things like this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I think employers are wising up to these kinds of things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Exactly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They know we have a diversity problem in, for example, in technology companies and they kind of like working towards it. But it takes a long time to make any progress</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: and obviously that comes with the idea of more students need more that I’ve, in general a variety. She does need to pick up computer science in schools and then universities and then they get to the employees So I think it’s quite of a slower. A slow advancement?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, its takes years, doesn’t it? Yeah. Things change because of culture. Okay, good. So, is there anything else you want to say more about minorities?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Oh, I love to talk about it, but I feel like we are getting on for time?</p>

<div id="harry-styles" class="section level2" number="27.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">27.8</span> One tune</h2>
<p>Let’s move on, there’s two things left. So this is one tune, one podcast, one film. So we love our music and our films and our podcasts. And Unfortunately, my playlist is dominated by lots of dad rock. So, I’ve been asking students to well, two things rejuvenate it with something a bit different or perhaps internationalise it, you know, because obviously, a lot of the music I listen to is British and American.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, you know, it’s kind of fun when people recommend stuff, I would never otherwise have listened to. So one tune that you the special to you for some reason, one podcast. Mybe you don’t listen to podcasts, but if perhaps some kind of could be a radio programming, let’s do and then one film.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Yeah, so I’m gonna try to be brief. It took, it’s very difficult. See, it’s very difficult. So I want to say, I’m gonna recommend you two tunes because I can’t think one. So, the first one is also quite broad. I would recommend you literally anything by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Styles">Harry Styles</a>, (see figure @ref(fig:harry-styles-fig)). I love it, but it’s British see, that’s another thing, but then it’s also British so I don’t think it’s gonna widen your playlist enough. I adore Harry Styles anyway.</p>

<p>He’s quite, what’s the word? Well dressed …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: He’s amazing. I aodre him but this is not a Harry Styles fan podcast so I have to move on. The next one is one that I used to play during the hard times of exam season. So she is Romanian, she’s a Romanian artist, her name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inna">INNA</a> (see figure @ref(fig:inna-fig)). The song that I like from her is called <em>Iguana</em>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-iguana">Apostoleanu 2018</a>)</span> It’s in Spanish. She actually sings in Spanish. Absolutely amazing I used to listen to it every single time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sad song or an uplifting song?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: literally uplifting. I don’t even know what she’s saying. I don’t know Spanish, it’s just it’s very funny. Yes. And I used to listen in on the speaker every single morning during exam season because I would be so tired, so done, to have to go to the library again, or Kilburn (building) again. So I just had, I just needed a little bit of joy in my life, so that was my morning song.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">27.11</span> Advice to your former self</h2>
<p>So, the last thing is I call this time travel. So, if you could travel back in time to meet yourself as a first year, incoming student, what advice would you give yourself? Now it might be advice for yourself, and that might be different from advice you’d give to other people. So what you’d advise like how to get the most out of university?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: I think my personal advice realising now this year, how amazing everyone that I was friends with was I would recommend myself to kind of make a bit more. Obviously it’s quite overwhelming, right? First year you have a lot of people but I feel like I didn’t try to make as many friends that were international and British in first year just because probably I was a bit scared language barrier. A bit stressful time Romanian. Yeah, I thought I feel like I was trying to stay a bit more Romanians which I think it was very good for me. Especially in the first semester right now. Working very yeah character to come to a different country and then study in a different language that was shocking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: But I do feel like all my friendships have been so rewarding and they’re having really sweet and actually my friends in third. Yeah, I would make jokes with them because I knew them in firstly I was just so scared to say hi to them. So it’s kind of like, well, good friends. Now why didn’t I become friends with you in first year?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I think it’s an important part of, I mean, we touched a little bit on grades, but I see quite a few students, you know, and it’s good if they want to get good grades, but then they miss out on some of that social stuff. Which is important and I know it’s not always easy to balance grades and social life, but I think it’s an important part of why you’re here is to meet people from all over the world and you know, some of those people you’ll still be in touch with 30 years later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: So, I think I think is really good and I feel like Kilburn does that amazingly just because obviously it’s difficult to balance friends and grades but what is even better is to have friends that you exactly that hope you get your grades. So that’s why I’ve been doing. It’s been amazing. It’s been great. Great mix great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay. So I think that’s everything. So, important advice, to be bold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: make friends</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and make friends and put yourself out there throughout your university career. So thank you, Alice for joining us today and good luck with your new job starting in September. So, enjoy the rest of the summer. Thank you. And yeah, thank you for coming.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.1</span> What’s your story Sneha?</h2>
<p>So, welcome Sneha, thank you for coming on the show. Let’s start with, tell us a little bit about yourself and where you come from?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: So my name is Sneha, like you said, I’ve just finished so I’m so excited. Just graduated (from) my Bachelor of Science (degree) in Computer Science with a year in industry from the University of Manchester. I’m actually from Manchester, this is my hometown and but originally grew up here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You grew up in Manchester?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: since I’m twenty three years old, right? Well, okay. But I was originally born in India but like my whole life has been in Manchester. A little bit about me.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="sneha-why" class="section level2" number="28.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.2</span> Why study Computer Science?</h2>
<p>Good. Okay, so the next question is I’m really interested to find out <em>why</em> people study computing because there’s lots of routes into it as a subject. So what was it that made you think this is something I’d like to spend three or four years at university doing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: so it wasn’t something I was always “oh this is my calling”, you know, this is my this is the field of my choice. I was thinking of various things but I am it may not be as exciting, but that whole going through the education process from like GCSE and then to like a level and then, you know, at that point I think I had that good firm like but you know that ground that footwork. So that’s really helped because, you know, it made that I had that incremental kind of development when it came to the subject and then like obviously I enjoyed don’t a bit of computing,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You did on a GCSE (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education">General Certificate of Secondary Education</a>) in computing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: Yes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-level">A-level</a> as well. Yeah, right. Okay, so I did both That’s just because my school offered it I thought you know why not but before I didn’t have any like in primary school and nothing but I think that really helped so because like I enjoyed it and then also like you know I did do well in it. I thought you know this is maybe like you know a good and it has obviously good prospect as a field and like another thing I always say is it has that right balance between the creativity and problem solving and trying to get you to use your brain because I like my creative sides. I’m very like, you know, artistic I do a lot of artwork and things. And so this was like, you know, kind of an outlet in some sense as well. And that progressive nature of the subject means, like, you know, you start off small and you get bigger and bigger and bigger, and you get feedback as you go through those steps. So I really enjoyed programming, you write a piece of code and then it does something and you kind of see it, you know, quite instantly like, you know, not always but like, quite most of the time usually, see it doing something and that gives you that gratification. So that was probably the reason why</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good. Okay. You studied computer science in your first year and then at the beginning of the second year you decided to do a placement. Was it something you decided before you came or is it something you decided when you got here? You thought actually I’d like to do a placement?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: So actually, so what happened was I was on the bachelor’s, you know, your standard three year bachelor’s course. And then I came into the interview day and that’s when they introduced what an industrial placement is I never even knew what that meant and they explained what it was to me and I thought hey that actually sounds really useful. So on my interview day after that, I spoke to one of the people there and I said, like do you think I could change? So they told me to just email someone and that’s how like I, you know, switched onto it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="matillion" class="section level2" number="28.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.3</span> Matillion</h2>
<p>So the beginning of your second year, you started looking for placements or did you have any experience before then, any kind of in? So you going in? I think that’s most people. I like that. Yeah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: Kind of get your second year and it’s like, I want to get some experience now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how did you go about choosing somewhere to work? The interesting thing is that different people have different obstacles they face when they find a job. So what were the obstacles you came across and how did you get around them?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, like some obstacles, obviously, finding them . Finding one (where) they like you and you like them as well, obviously there’s always that they have to choose you, but you also have to, choose them. So, it’s that kind of liking towards the company. So there were companies, I applied for and things, but they, if I had got a placement, it would have just been for the sake of, getting a placement there rather than I actually enjoy, you know, I’d want to work there and I’m like, obviously you have your like challenges of like, you know, the interviews and the coding assessments (see section @ref(codinginterview)) and all of these like things especially for me because I never really did. This is like my first job like ever, like even like, you know, no part-time job previously. So, like this is all fresh new to me. So, just knowing how to navigate that. I made the mistake of not maybe applying to loads, I know loads people who just applied to like a ton. So if I’d go back, I would apply to way more than I did. So, you know, just and also, I’m very timid, so I got really scared and overwhelmed. So actually putting my foot forward to just apply. That was a challenge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jump in the water and see what happens?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: Exactly. That was quite challenging but and also the coding assessments were , obviously you do that throughout, you know, your years of programming, but actually being like, you know, this, you’re gonna get a job based on this. It never experienced. That’s, that was another challenge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, definitely. So when what was I mean, I guess you, you must have had some unsuccessful interviews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: you know, most people get quite a few rejections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t they see how you had some rejections? I guess was location of factor. Use of trying to target a particular location. Or will you anywhere in the UK? Or I</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I genuinely didn’t mind. I mean, I didn’t apply outside of the UK. I was all within the UK but I wasn’t like like to pick you if it was like Manchester or elsewhere like I didn’t mind. Right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: So the company ended up working for was a <a href="https://www.matillion.com/">matillion.com</a>. It’s in Manchester. (see figure @ref(fig:matillion-fig))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So can you tell us about what Matillion does?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: So Matillion’s focus is data transformation. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL: Extract, transform, load</a>) So for cloud data warehouses, so it helps companies transform their data, especially, to move it to the cloud and it provides that middle software (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware">middleware</a>) that the product basically helps take the data, you know, extract it from wherever their company may have their data transform it allows the company to transform in a way they see fit.

And I also other products help like analyse data and, like, in the cloud and help, you know, people be able to, like,</p>

<p>What was your particular role you there (at matillion)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: I was going in as a placement software engineer. So, the good thing was, I wasn’t even treated as a placement software engineer. I was just treated as a normal software engineer, in the sense that my work wasn’t separate like in, like, oh, you can do this little project on the side. It was very much. You’re on the product and you’re gonna impact as much as anyone else. Yeah. That’s good. To be to be a part of the team. Yeah, not</p>
</blockquote>
<p>not sort of somebody who is making cups of tea?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: Exactly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what would you say the main things you learn from your placement?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: You learn a whole lot of stuff at university, using the main things you’ve got out for your placement work. So like you for like so you have the educational side where that I learnt a lot about you know, software engineering practices because during uni you learn a lot of theory and learn a lot (about) developing your programming skills and everything. But you know in a practical industrial level, you never really see that side until maybe third year. But before that, I never really got that. So actually how the industry works, how a company a software company works that was what was introduced and I thought that was very interesting and, like different that definitely like, you know, it we did the whole software engineering module in year two. It was like kind of applying those principles but it also helped me kind of understand agile practices more which really helped in third year and just how to co-operate with different team members and when you’re working on such a big like, you know, this is not just a small repo, it’s huge and you’re working on a big product, like how that goes, what the process is like, obviously, you can’t affect something. So, dangerously. So you, there’s a whole protocol and you kind of learn about these things and, you know, what’s the most efficient thing for a team. But also on the other side is just like personally I got a lot of communication like, you know, I built that communication a skill and then also just like ownership of the work that I did because I understood, you know, this is gonna impact something bigger than just, maybe like a coursework in like, you know, university. So you have to really put your effort into it and it’s more than just something for you. It’s something bigger. So, you know, taking responsibility and also the good thing about the company I work for is that they, you know, encouraged even me who’s just like a placement, like, and software engineer. It’s like, actually coming to meetings. Give my say and like that can actually have an impact on the company. So they, I think that’s okay. And I guess a lot of cloud stuff as well because you’ve done some theory of the cloud stuff, but actually using it using AWS to in using GCP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform">Google Cloud Platform</a>) and things like that to do to do stuff. Yes. Customers in your experience as well. Oh, for sure. So most enjoyable partner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe you’ve covered that already but what was the most enjoyable thing about working. Apart from being paid!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: That was amazing I think. So one thing that kind of was a bit sad for my placement, it was completely remote because of COVID Obviously. Yeah. So placement was just like all like I was just confined to my desk and the people yeah at home and people I met was just like my team and that was about it. But even despite that the social life of the company was like, they were really trying the hardest. So you know that actually did help because everyone is super friendly. I think also because it’s not a huge company. Everyone’s very homely, everyone just really wants to try and make everyone feel welcome. So I really enjoyed the culture that was the, I think that that’s the biggest reason why I like this. Come, I chose the company because the culture was just super like sweet, everyone was nice and they really want to like better. You like you know, help you out. So, you everyone just willing to help no, major big pressure, Obviously, this responsibility, but nothing, you never felt bad about anything and that learning environment. They always encourage you to work. So once every month, they’d encourage us to just stop with our work and just learn something they we had <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">udemy.com</a> available to us. So I started learning courses on that. So I think it was just the extra things aside from just work.Yeah, that really I made it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Culture is important I think some people sometimes lose sight of that. It’s just kind of just look at the bottom line with how much are they paying?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And sometimes I think sometimes an interview can be quite hard to work out what the culture is actually like until you actually start there and but it was good to hear you had a good experience of that.</p>

<p>Sneha: Yes, so my final year project was <em><a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/coding-their-future">Coding their Future</a></em> and my supervisor was you! So, the final year project basically looked into the current state of secondary school, education of computer science and the focus I wanted to take with it was identifying potential problems or issues with the current, state of the education potentially, even the curriculum and then finding actual practical solutions for teaching because currently, the uptake of it is very low. So how can we make that, you know, much better. And so the way that was done, was I worked with a school and a class and trialled different teaching methods, how different materials make create a different materials, used hardware and various other resources to enthuse the students to actually enjoy computer science rather than just have to do it because it’s part of the school curriculum</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, did you find going back into school? Because it’s very different, isn’t it being at the front of the classroom? As opposed to being <em>in</em> the classroom as a student. So, how was that? How did you find that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: it was actually surreal because I actually went back to my high school with my computer science teacher. So, it was really weird that now I’m working with my teacher rather than as a student. So, teaching the students, I think I was slightly like blessed in a sense, because the class were really nice. They were all willing to learn. They weren’t super disruptive. Obviously, there were some characters, but, you know, the teacher was there to like, you know, calm down. Do the behaviour control kind of thing. But it was very interesting to see how they responded. And I was actually very surprised to see, like some of the trends, you know, of how they reacted to different things. And, but also because I taught year 9 class, some of them, that’s when you choose your options, some of them kind of like, knew coming in, they weren’t gonna pick computer science. So they didn’t think to try. So that was slightly (a) struggle when you’re trying to, you know, get them to do stuff but they don’t want to because they know they aren’t interested. So that was slightly, you know,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit of a battle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sneha: Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ongoing battle. I suppose?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sneha: Yeah</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good. Okay. So what comes next? So you’re graduating next week?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sneha: Yes. Next in next Thursday</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are you planning to do after?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sneha: I’m obviously going to have some time off and relax a bit. I’m still going to work at Matillion but I won’t be a placement software engineer. So I’ll be a graduate software engineer. I’ll be continuing to work with the same team on the same product but we’re shifting to a different project so I’ll be helping on the new project. It’s a bit more of my knowledge on this so that’s why they decided to keep me on it and also like I do plan on like you know while I’m at the company. I want to learn and they offer like you know, to go and do courses to keep it like agile courses or like AWS courses keep you know in that education field. Long-term wise I do you know, ideally I do want to do a masters in computer science. But I have to see like, you know what, the future holds. But I do want to get further, even further with education.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s good to sometimes just have a little bit of a break, and I think it takes quite a long time to digest what you’ve done. It’s so intense, especially during COVID as well. You’ve covered a lot of ground in the last four years and I think it just takes a while for some of those things to sink in and think, what am I doing next what am I interested in?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sneha: Exactly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s no great, hurry to decide about going into postgraduate and I think sometimes having that experience of working will help you if you do decide to go and do postgraduate study</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: that’s what I was thinking. If you know, the feel like they value like experience a lot, I thought that would be better. And also you know you I’ve been studying from like, you know, proper like state school like exams from GCSE like year 10 all the way until now like it’s a lot. So I definitely need that break before pursuing even further education.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so that’s the degree bit your degree, your life in four years would cover that very quickly. There’s a few other things to visit here. So they’re one of them is minority Report. So you’re a emember of a minority group. You’re a woman and you’re also a British Asian. So I’d been interested in know what your experience have been has been when we’ve spoken to some people about these things already. But the interesting know what your experiences have been as of that in university and then also in the workplace as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: So, with in terms of the university the good thing is, is like it’s very diverse. So, for example, all the people that I’ve talked to especially my friendship group is super diverse in the sense backgrounds. So I have friends, literally from all the different continents you know, it’s very diverse. So you see loads of different heritages and people and you learn a lot and we actually talk about these things and they’re all different experiences. You’re learning from each other which I think, in terms of diversity of like, culture and background. It’s definitely like a good place for the university and then but like in terms of maybe of like, you know, as a woman I think I it there is like, kind of a struggle. Sometimes I’d say, in my year, there were quite a few.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think, I need to look at the stats but I think it’s something around about 25% of undergraduate students in computer science are women. So you’re in a not a tiny minority, but still a minority. So I wonder if there’s anything that they’re not just this university but all universities can do to make the subject more welcoming or interesting or more desirable to women.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: That was part of my final project was to look at how to introduce, how to demystify, those stereotypes of the subject. you know, encourage females to take up the subject to enjoy the subject. Making it look show, maybe the more creative side, you know, catering to things that women tend to know like, yeah, I think there is that like that, you know, you can kind of tell, it’s 25%, as I mean, if you like, look at like a lecture theatre or like, you’ll be start, you know, like this big, yeah, obvious indication and even personally, even though there were likely in a lots of females I could talk to and stuff, most of my friends were male not because like I couldn’t make friends with females but because there weren’t like as many and, you know, sometimes as, you know, like a few more you want to see like especially, you know, your representation kind of you kind of want to feel a bit more comfortable knowing that you’re not just the only one and also you’re able to share experiences where because I think that’s definitely a big thing you know, you as a woman and you as a male like they’re they will be differences. And Ifeel like I could have had a bit more of a more comfortable feeling if I could have more female to relate to. But I know the, you know, especially in computer science, there are like initiatives to get that kind of going. So, you know, I can’t say that there’s nothing going on. I just think, you know, maybe a little bit more work in that sense. In terms of workplace, I can say that they are definitely trying</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone’s trying. Well, <em>most</em> people are trying. Anyway. It’s a hard problem, isn’t it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: it really is yeah, they try and introduce seminars or they had like a whole weekly meeting talking about, they got like, professional to talk about these things. But like, as much as you know, there is a lot of diversity. I feel like maybe in the engineering department, there’s less diversity. Once again, predominantly male and actually, even predominantly, , white males and even more with recruitment to my team, the past three people that have come in, have all been white males and so that I know they are aware. They’re recruitment is a little bit, you know, maybe not as diverse, and they’re trying to change that. So I do I see that they are trying, but they’re obviously things, you like kind of see and like, the reason is like, like the reason why I’d want to get a bit more diverse as a person like, you know, like from a minority group, it’s just, you know, these kind of things they do impact your experience computer science or at work, at school. So you kind of want to be able to relate to other people in these experiences. So I think that’s why like a super important to be able to see that. But what, in terms of teaching, a lot of the lecturers I do, they will a lot of female lecturers and even my like, supervisor from first and second was a female. So, like it would like, I think in terms of like staff and teaching that was quite good diversity.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.5</span> One tune</h2>
<p>So the last thing to finish up, well, the last bit to finish up is one one tune one podcast. And one film was the penultimately? Yeah. Is so, um, a piece of music.</p>
<p>There’s lots of musical references in this textbook, code in your future. And do you have a piece of music that’s important to you that you could add to our playlist (see section @ref(coders))? So when I was like reading this, it said it’s mostly like, dadrock. And I this funny thing is is that I’m not really gonna be going far from that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: The song that I chose was a November Rain <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-novemberrain">Rose 1992</a>)</span> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_N%27_Roses">Guns N’ Roses</a>, see figure @ref(fig:gnr-fig)</p>

<p>Okay, good. Now that’s good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: It’s very good song. Like the reason I think it was like, super important to me first of all like the, you know, the vibes of the song is very like impactful. Like you got you can listen to it when you’re like sad or you can listen to when you like need to get pumped up like and the reason like it means so much to me is is that it’s the song that for ages me my sister, my dad on the way to school, we would just listen to this and then on the way back we would listen to this. So it’s very reminiscent and so that was the go-to song and then after a while I just like didn’t like it’s like you know, you kind of just forget about it and then what reminded me was the recent Thor film and that was released thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Thor: Love and thunder</em> and it’s used on that it was <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-loveandthunder">Waititi 2022</a>)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>it was on the soundtrack and like this fight scene and it was just like, it made me feel like all the emotions like, you know, like just kind of gave me that nostalgia and I realised, oh my gosh, this is such a good song.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So as soon as after that, like me and my sister we put it back on our playlist because we like, you know, just realised like it’s such a good song.</p>
</div>
<div id="rottenmango" class="section level2" number="28.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.6</span> One podcast</h2>
<p>Good choice. Okay. So the other thing and is one podcast. I don’t know if you listen to podcast but other if there are good podcasts out there that you listen to would you is the one that you recommend?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t really tend to listen to many. But one podcast I do is rotten mango. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rottenmango">Soo 2022</a>)</span> It’s very, it’s more. Like, if you’re into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime">true crime</a> obviously dark topics, but she takes it from a psychological perspective and a legal perspective, all these different things, it’s tied in a more lighthearted way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously in a more, it’s still respectful. But in a very, you know, you’re not feeling like groggy and like upset about the things you’re listening to. It’s very like interesting. So, if you’re into that, it’s really good. Okay. And then one film, was it gonna be the same film that you would just talk about using a different filter?</p>
</div>
<div id="threeidiots" class="section level2" number="28.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.7</span> One film</h2>
<p>I think if anyone asks me this is my film, it’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Idiots">3 idiots</a>, see figure @ref(fig:three-idiots-fig). <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-threeidiots">Hirani 2009</a>)</span> It’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> film, but it’s got a lot of global recognition.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/three-idiots.jpeg" alt="(ref:captionidiots)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:three-idiots-fig)(ref:captionidiots)
</p>
</div>
<p>(ref:captionidiots) 3 Idiots is a 2009 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age comedy-drama film written, edited and directed by Rajkumar Hirani and co-written by Abhijat Joshi, with producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-threeidiots">Hirani 2009</a>)</span></p>
<p>So obviously it’s in a different language. What sort of is, is it maybe made recently? Or is it? Oh no, it’s almost like 2000. I mean not old all the 2009? Yeah, 10 years ago, he’s old. So it’s the best Like, obviously, because it’s in a different language, you may think?</p>
<p>Oh no, like, can’t really relate, but it’s like generally, it just it crosses culture.</p>
<p>Does it have all the Bollywood dancing and the music?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha It was it It is. The story is of like three guys who go through who get into like one of the best engineering schools in India and it deals with the pressures of like you know having to do well and it deals also with like different societal issues, you know, pressures of yourself, precious of your family, maybe like this is not the field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You even want to go in or like all of these like very relatable topics that, you know, I feel like students do go through and but it and it deals with like a lot of like deep hard-hitting problems but it does all of that while still also being like the funniest film ever.</p>
<p>So it’s like it’s got the comedy, the drama. It’s got the romance. It’s got the suspense. Like, it’s got everything. Like, that’s why I recommend it strongly. I don’t even speak Hindi. So like, I have to watch it with sometimes but still I, I don’t watch films like over and over again.</p>
<p>But I watched this one like five for six times. Crazy actually.</p>

<div id="sselfie" class="section level2" number="28.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.8</span> Advice to your former self</h2>
<p>I’ll make a note of that one definitely. So the last thing to finish up then is I call this time travel. So, if you could travel back in time to meet yourself in the first year, what advice would you give yourself or perhaps current or incoming first, second year, students. What advice would you give them to get the most out of their time at university?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: So I think to two things. So the first one is just putting yourself out there and taking risks because more often than not, it’s rewarding. Because even if like it’s not your even if you don’t get your like intended result, the fact that you’ve done it and you’ve tried is better than not knowing if you didn’t try so like especially like when I was applying for like placements and stuff completely out of my like, you know what?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: I know. So I when I did that, you know, obviously after some time, like I did get that reward from it. So just really putting yourself out of your comfort zone. Going to things and I’d say, because obviously with COVID and stuff. Like, you know, it was a bit more difficult but even like socially just like, you know, trying to put yourself out there as an introvert. That’s very scary to me. But it’s more often than not there’s pay off from it. So that’s the first piece and then the second one is just hanging in there. You know persevering because to think that my university journey was super smooth sailing is very naive. I remember first year, obviously University of Manchester has really high standards, especially in the computer science department, and that means with such high standards. You kind of doubt yourself, you think maybe this isn’t for me and that was definitely something I went through. First year, I was even looking at maybe I should apply for a different course. I think the thing that consolidated, yes, this is your field. This is what, you know, you want to do, was my placement. Yeah, actually,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: <strong>After my placement, I knew I actually enjoyed this. I can do for the rest of my life like this. That consolidated it for me.</strong> And so even with struggles and coursework and pressure and eventually those things will finish and those things, you know, you will overcome and then not more often than not. They’re not gonna impact your life. You know. Long-term so like is you just kind of have to push through that bit? Yeah, now I’m sitting here about to graduate, so it does pay off just pushing through</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s good advice. Okay, good. Well, thank you, thank you for joining us today</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha so much for having me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we look forward to seeing you at graduation next week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: Yeah, so exciting. Okay. Thank you.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">29.1</span> What’s your story Carmen?</h2>
<p>So, welcome Carmen thank you for coming on the show. The purpose of this interview is to catch up with you, find out a little bit more about your journey from arriving here, four years ago through to your journey while you’ve been here and what comes next? So what should we start off with? Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and where you come from? As much or as little as you want to say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: I’m Carmen, I’m originally from Spain, born and raised there and from small southern town <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbella">Marbella</a>. So, very different to Manchester.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you went to school in Spain?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Yeah, I went to school in Spain. Never moved abroad until I was 18 when I came to University in Manchester.</p>

<div id="why-carmen" class="section level2" number="29.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">29.2</span> Why study Computer Science?</h2>
<p>So what made you choose computer science as a subject?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: So when I was actually applying for degrees, I didn’t know what I wanted to do and it was December and obviously applications closed in January and I had to start writing my personal statement, to a point where the head (teacher), a schoolmaster called me and it was like coming. Where’s your personal statement? You need to start applying. And I don’t know what I want to do. I knew I liked ICT and art and maths and then he was like, so have you thought about double degree in math and physics? I’m like, no. Physics it’s not for me. So, then he said, oh, what about software, engineering, computer science, and I was like, what is that? So back home, it’s not really a thing, it’s still the idea that technology is what you do in a basement, antisocial. That’s the stereotype. So then I was like, sure, let’s just go for it. And then I ended up applying for software engineering and that’s how I got here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s good advice. I think one of the interesting things is is a lot of decisions people make about what to study at university comes from family, teachers and peers etc and sometimes those people good advice, sometimes they don’t give good advice at all!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: I told one of my family members that I was going to study software engineering and they had a full-on go at me, I feel why would I do that? I’m gonna have not a pretty life. I’m gonna be so miserable. I when I came here, realised, that was not gonna be the right thing was gender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ll talk more about this later, was it perceived as, that’s not subject for women? Or was that, not on the table?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: I think at that point it was more, it wasn’t one of the core traditional paths back home, more like architect, doctors, teaching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, good. So, can you tell us a bit then about your story. So you arrived here in Manchester and you’ve been studying. So you actually I suppose fast forward to second year. What happened in second year when you you I think you decided to do a placement from the beginning from the get-go. Was it something? You thought your peers persuaded you? It was a good idea?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definitely the latter. I came into Manchester not knowing what a placement was, but everyone kind of just said, do a placement, do an internship. It’s great. So, I kind of got pushed into it changed into that degree. So added that onto my degree, and then started looking for a placement. Second year, was tough time managing that and like, dealing with rejections and all, that is a horny thing to go through. It’s very draining very heartbreaking but it’s very rewarding at the end</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time-consuming as well? So how long did it take? How many roughly? How many applications did you do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: And I was quite lucky that sense. I think I only did about 14 right? Oh with like maybe four of those being emails that sent out to startups because at the beginning, I wanted to go into more startuppy vibes. But then I decided to go through normal job applications, apply to about 10 and obviously you get the bit but the imposter syndrome. When you get all your friends getting applying to the big companies, I didn’t want to work for a big company back then. So they obviously get the job opposite first and you feel like you’re not good enough or you’re not making it but then the offers starts to come in and then it feels a lot nicer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I guess did you have many interviews before? The one you got? Did you have many unsuccessful interviews? Because it’s not like an interview for university, some universities don’t have interviews at all, so that’s a whole new experience in a way, isn’t it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Yes. Absolutely. I remember the first one I did actually was broke company. I didn’t really want to apply for, so that was good. But even then, that went absolutely shambles. I we got a tour of the headquarters as well, and the factory. The point at which I was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining">mansplained</a> was very big. I walked out thinking, I don’t care if I get the offer because I’m not coming here. So it was a big eye-opening time and then after that I was way pickier with the companies I applied for.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="the-walt-disney-company" class="section level2" number="29.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">29.3</span> The Walt Disney Company</h2>
<p>You actually did a placement and internship. Did you which one which way round did you do it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: I did first my placement, the placement was at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">The Walt Disney Company</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-carmen2">Práxedes 2022</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What were you doing? Brief description of what you were doing for Walt Disney.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: So we’re just an internal applications kind of improving efficiency of finance and HR teams across the globe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you were in one team for the whole 12 months duration?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Yes for nine months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And your work I guess you’re working with a combination of technical and non-technical people in that role in that year?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Yes, it was mainly technical. It was maybe like one or two that were non-technical but that’s about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So on the back of that then you’ve got did a summer internship after you’ve done a placement. I guess was getting interviews a little bit easier. Once you have the first thing under your belt</p>
<blockquote>
<p>getting that first job is definitely the hardest and I feel like doing the summer internship after really helped get the most out of it because having already know how to get to new code base and just get familiar enough to speed as much faster.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="mckinsey" class="section level2" number="29.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">29.4</span> McKinsey</h2>
<p>The summer internship was at McKinsey? What year was this this? When did the pandemic hit 2020? So you’d started your placement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Yes. So physically, no, I did it fully, right? You’re right, you started remotely. I did my full placement remote and then I realised. That’s not something I ever want to do, again, anyone does. And then when I got the office first summer internship, I got the ones. I boiled it down to was one that was remote and what that was in person and I went for the one in person, right? Because I cannot do another six eight weeks of remote and then McKinsey put me in person and we got to travel with the company and that was the best experience ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that was McKinsey (see figure @ref(fig:mckinsey-fig)). So you were based in London, with different clients I guess?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: So I was put on our US client but to get to the US during COVID you couldn’t just get that easily. So we had to do two weeks in Mexico first. So we travelled there. The day before we were meant to leave for the US, Mexico was on the red list. So I had to fly home and then never got to go to the client, but I got two weeks in Mexico. My first in-person job was two weeks in Mexico. I think that was pretty good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hear that Mexican Spanish is very different from Spanish Spanish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: I couldn’t understand the menu when I went to order food. I was like, I don’t know any of these</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone was telling me the other day, Spanish person telling me that Google Translate when it does translate from English to Spanish, It does English to Latin or Hispanic Spanish rather than European Spanish Spanish. So, Spanish teachers here can always tell when their students are using Google Translate because it comes up with all these weird Latin American sayings and things that you would never say (in Spain).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: That makes so much sense actually. Yeah, no. It’s you can really tell the difference. Especially there are a lot more formal than we are probably.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you did your summer internship in London and then you came back to Manchester to do your final year?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you did a project, what was your project?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: It was AI face ageing. So I could I actually use your picture as well for it and I made you look about 50 years old!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh no! Anyway, my face is getting older. So you kind of what you developing algorithms for doing that effectively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: I used two different models on how to create that image? So that should help like, for example, missing people, that could help the police, it has different applications</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was that awful Facebook thing, was it face age or something?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceApp">FaceApp</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robbing people’s data…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Yes. Actually while it was yeah, using pictures on them the Russian app. Yes, I actually include that my report because yeah, that was one thing we went we obviously shouldn’t do. So yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I suppose, one interesting thing is like, how did you find that transition from, so it’s all about change, isn’t it? You sort of you started as an undergraduate and that’s what one change. And then you go to a completely different world of work and that’s another change and then you come back to university and it’s another change again. So, how did you find that transition back into university?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Going back to uni was a lot better than when I started Uni, because I felt like, when I started uni, I was a lost puppy. I didn’t have any software engineering background, I didn’t know anything about coding. I didn’t know what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> was. I was completely lost. Starting the job you also still feel a bit of like, what’s going on. It’s a new company. You’re still big loss. Then when I went back to uni, because I already knew what it was like and I felt like during my placement, my confidence actually um, got built up a bit given that I actually managed to put to test my skills and managed to kind of just understand everything that’s going on. I felt a bit more confident myself when addressing the courseworks and labs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you were a (Peer Assisted Study Sessions)<a href="http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk/">PASS</a> leader?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: I was PASS leader in second year and past coordinator in third year, right? Okay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I guess that’s kind of that’s kind of fun. I think. Yes sociable and especially after the pandemic, having everything online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: I definitely things physically definitely took to an extreme. The fact that in third year they say that yours have a bit more free time and just decided to sign up to as many as extra curriculars as possible and take on a part-time job, which was a bit too much but it was fun and kept you entertained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, good. Okay. So, So what else have we got here? So it’s got a questions about challenging things, about your job, what the most challenging things about your work life, would you say in terms of adapting to that and then working? Because working as a software engineer in a university or learning about software engineering university is quite different from actually when we try and simulate the real world and yeah we can do some simulation but there’s an awful lot of simulation that can’t be done. So what was what was you say was? Most tricky thing about adapting to the real world?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: I think the main thing for me was that I was used to seeing the things, but in a smaller scale and I didn’t see it fully applied to the real world. So when I saw it at work or the little things that we had been taught uni kind of come together, it was it took me like maybe a couple months to just kind of put everything together and be like oh this now makes sense or this was taught this way because of this. So on bringing all that knowledge together was definitely a thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And pulling pulling together things not just from one module but I guess from several absolutely also seeing hopefully seeing a bigger picture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Yes, the it was that combination of everything that really set in</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You finished your exams?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes. Last week two weeks ago, was it first of June?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’ve had you’ve been able to enjoy the nice Mediterranean weather we’re having!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Yes it feels like home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, and what comes next? So what what your plans for the future after graduation?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: So I’m still carrying on the part-time job with the startup that I did throughout the year and they’ve offered me to go back full-time whenever I want basically, but then I also have the return offer from McKinsey, which I would be starting in September. Oh, so currently, I’m, I’m gonna move to London. That’s one thing that I know for sure. And then in July, I’m gonna take that as a month of kind of test out what would be like full-time at the startup. Then I’m working for and then once I’ve done that, decided of, if I’d stay with the startup gift to McKinsey,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s good to I suppose have that option of testing it, you don’t always have that luxury.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: No, it’s actually been very lucky in that sense but I do know that I love travelling and I know with McKinsey it’s so client-based. I really enjoy that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although there’s less travel these days with consultancies in the, you know, previously you’d spend you’d be like a road warrior, being on the road all the time and now, yeah, you still have to do that face-to-face stuff. But here’s a lot of stuff via teams and zoom and whatnot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Yes. Um, which is also what I was scared about if that would affect anything. So I was speaking with firm themselves and they were like, there’s a lot of people that also don’t want to travel as well, So they would kind of allocate the clients. Hopefully, I’d be like, yeah, I want to travel so hopefully, I mean that I’d get to be with those clients</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I think while you’re young as well. So while you’re young, it’s good to travel because you don’t have any commitments or have less commitments and you enjoy it. Enjoy that kind of lifestyle while you can because it sometimes becomes harder as you get older. And so, the other thing is, so that was telling us about your story. The other bit is then minority report. So you are a member of minority group. That’s grand. As a woman, what’s you experience been in the university. I was going to look at the figures, but I think was something around about 25% of the undergraduate population here (in computer science) are female.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: yes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it not a disaster, but could be a whole lot better. That probably reflects what you saw in industry as well?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: I would guess. Yeah, I think slightly less from what I saw</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: So I’d say it’s pretty good in Manchester that we have that. It’s definitely a thing that every girl knows every other girl in the degree because when you walk in, kind of it’s a bit thing and when it’s a girl walking in rather than a guy. I didn’t notice it much at first. I didn’t think I realised because of the lack of knowledge. I had microaggressions, that actually arise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was it like this at school? Sometimes you find that maths is, I think math is, it varies with countries, but I think in the UK, there are roughly equal numbers of male and female students do maths A-level, I think.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: We had, we were three girls in a class of 10 to 15, right? So, it wasn’t that much. And yes, that definitely did have an impact</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you’ve done physics as well, I know physics has a similar (problem).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Yeah, it was like three to ten,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. Okay. So what could the university and employers do, to make campuses and workplaces more welcoming to to women as a profession and as, you know, as students,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: I think for me, it’s raising awareness on females and non-females. A lot of people identify people who don’t identify female because for those who do identify female, we might receive these comments and we just take them in. We’re not good enough or take them personally, whereas actually it has nothing to do with us or like if someone’s underestimating my ability it doesn’t mean it’s because I have to prove them wrong. I have to do this, which is something that I constantly feel like, sometimes it’s like, oh, I need to prove them just because I’m a female. But then also with people who don’t identify as female to be understand. You can’t mansplain real numbers to someone who’s that, you know which has happened. And it’s like, I’m 22 at University. I think I know what real numbers are. Yeah. Honest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But part of the problem is the people mansplaining don’t realise. So, that is not (always) malicious. It’s just ignorance in a way, I suppose unconscious bias or whatever you want to call it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Yeah. So we had actually we organised a few women and computer science events in Kilburn with another few students. And it was great because they actually made us more aware of other situations that maybe not, we can now reflect enough. Actually, that was not okay that if someone did that to me, and we’ve had conversation with people who actually try to mansplain to us like, oh yeah, mansplaining is not good and they’d be like, oh yeah, like I don’t</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’re mansplaning mansplaining to you!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: now for they’d be like, oh yeah, I don’t understand why anyone would mansplain. And we just be thinking like you’ve tried to mansplain to us. So it definitely shows how more awareness needs to be raised in that regard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other thing is, making the subject (Computer Science) more appealing to women. There’s lots of ideas about how to make it more appealing to women to apply to think about doing at university. Is there anything in the way that the subject is sold? Sold is not right word, in your case it was your head teacher. Who said, this is the thing. But some people look at it and think that’s not for me because computer science is just about making lots of money, or it’s just about building things that make other people lots of money. So one of the ideas out there is that you make the subject more appealing by showing examples of where it’s beneficial to society, rather than just, you know, commercially important. Say for example, I don’t know if that would have made a difference?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: I think for me just knowing what it was beforehand, I feel like the lack of exposure was a main thing. I guess this is still that stereotype that yeah, it’s just maybe also gaming and not very inviting. So getting rid of that stereotype would definitely be more beneficial for me if I back in the day and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From an employer point of view, I guess both of your employers would have been welcoming to women, but I guess you have you kind of different problems in the workplace. But what do you think employers could do to make this as profession more appealing or more welcoming to women.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: definitely as well.I guess it just boils back to the raising awareness. Again, I’ve had work meetings where a developer, I was the only female in that work meeting and male developer asked for everyone’s opinion individually on something. Excluding me. So it’s just kind of probably raising that way and stuff. Like why what’s the need to exclude someone or what’s the, why do you need to make comments like that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like that’s already quite inviting because it’s quite difficult for you to call that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Exactly. Yeah. I guess it’s your manager’s job. I suppose or whoever’s chairing the meeting to say let everyone speak or you haven’t asked Carmen for example what exactly and then it rated those uncomfortable situation it’s like how do you deal with that? Especially in the workplace, where, you know, you have to be a bit more formal and ethical.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">29.5</span> One tune</h2>
<p>To finish up then I’ve got we’ve got a few things here. So, and this is one tune, one podcast, One film. Yes. So, we have a playlist that’s associated with this podcast coders. Unfortunately, it’s full of lots of dad music because its put together by me. I’ve been asking students. So, is there a tune that you can use to rejuvenate, or freshen up our playlist? So, it might be something that’s important to to you. It might be something, it help a piece of music that helps you relax or might even help you work, or take your mind off work or remind your friends family, and that kind of thing. So, any any one, tune that you would recommend?</p>

<p>Carmen: There’s one that I’ve kind of got into lately, which is LOUD by Sofia Carson (see figure @ref(fig:sofia-carson-fig)) which is all about how how women are starting to give a bit more voice and things? And that’s making some people not feel uncomfortable. So that and it’s like why should you feel uncomfortable? Now that I actually speak up so I thought found that quite motivational in times where it gets a bit tough.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">29.8</span> Advice to your former self</h2>
<p>Okay good, thank you. So, any closing comments? Advice to your former self. So if you could speak to yourself in first year or to first or perhaps second year student, who is at the beginning of their studies, what would you advise them? I know you’ve been doing this in your roles are PASS leader. But what one piece of advice would you give them about getting the most out of being at university?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: Definitely getting involved? Because I feel like I took the most advantage of that I could and that was one thing. I know it’s hard to not compare yourself to others. I know we constantly do it. And you’re doing the labs and you do you may take, you see people who have been coding since they are tiny and they take two minutes to the labs. And we take, I don’t have any experience, so I took a bit way longer than that. So, just understand that the fact that they take less time, doesn’t mean that they will by the end of the degree. It doesn’t mean that they’ll land a better job because they’ve been coding for longer because it’s also about the learning stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Focusing on your also personal best, right? Yes. You know, not the Olympic gold medal standard? Yes. It’s just saying, well, am I doing better than I did last time? Absolutely. And it’s quite easy to fall in to that trap. I think especially at university where you’re surrounded by other people who bright, motivated and hardworking. And if you compare themselves to those, it can lead to mental health problems (see chapter @ref(nurturing)). I think, should we say? I’m not. Absolutely. It’s very demotivating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmen: So doing that and also balancing it out with the extra-curriculars it gives you also that extra, gives you more. Well, rounded for when you finish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, thank you for for joining us Carmen. Thank you and we’ll see you at graduation.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.1</span> What’s your story Brian?</h2>
<p>So thank you for coming in today, Brian and telling us a little bit more about your journey as a computer science student.</p>
</div>
<div id="brian-why" class="section level2" number="30.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.2</span> Why study Computer Science?</h2>
<p>So can you tell us a little bit about yourself and how you’ve got to how you came to study computer science?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yeah sure. So I’m originally from Spain and honestly I’ve always been sort of interested in computers and technology in general. So choosing computer science says a degree was kind of natural to me more less. And in my case I went for the option of computer science with business and management which I don’t think is an option anymore. Nonetheless it sort of combines computer science with some business subjects. So you kind of get exposure to both fields and I started in Manchester in 2018.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the pandemic?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: before the pandemic, had a very normal first year had half of a very normal second year, which got interrupted by the pandemic. Yeah. Which was, obviously, not a great time for everybody. But actually, as a result of the pandemic that kind of made me want to do an industrial placement, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you weren’t originally thinking of doing a placement?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: No, yes, so many of my friends. Well, some of my friends were gonna do it but I wasn’t that convinced because originally I didn’t really see the value of the point of doing it in this real experience. But primarily I kind of didn’t want to graduate online because that’s wasn’t what I was expecting. If I did my third year right after the pandemic, So I kind of stuff start panicking and looking for a placement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: When the pandemic started becoming a thing, right and struggled quite a lot, especially time of year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When did you start looking reuse as this? I guess as the pandemic hit in sort of February, January time we talking or was it before that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: So I actually applied to some random summer internships before that. So around like it’s a October November-ish 2019, but I was just applying just for the sake of applying I wasn’t like to motivated to, like, find a job. Which is a bit weird.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Um, no. I think lots of students do that so don’t worry. Yeah, that’s a common pattern. I see is the sort of just just try anything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yeah, but then it got to March April, when lockdowns were a thing and university was closed. So on the bright side that gave me more time to kind of look for jobs and many opportunities out there. On the other hand, many companies were stopping any hiring and they were just a lot of hiring freezes because no one knew without come of the pandemic. And the impact it would have on ill companies finances. So yeah, it was good in the sense, I had more free time, but bad in the sense I was, I’d say probably much more difficult to find a placement than during usual times, right?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="how-many" class="section level2" number="30.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.3</span> How many job applications?</h2>
<p>Yeah, so you struggled, how many places did you apply to?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: So I kind of started out applying to companies I was very interested in or just feels I was very interested in. And when that didn’t really work out, I just started basically sending my CV to any software engineering internship or placement, that would come across and in total, I don’t know, but definitely more than like 30. I’d say somewhere around the 50ish range.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And did you get any increase from that initially?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: So initially no, once things started so settling down a bit or around end of April start of May, I was getting more replies back I guess. So I was getting more opportunities to do interviews or virtual assessment centres since I couldn’t do them in person anymore, which is obviously, a bit strange since everything was now, done over Zoom where as opposed to doing them in person. But yeah, <strong>I’d say out of the 50 companies. I think I did a total of like 10 final round interviews or assessment centres and I still didn’t manage to get anything until the end of August start of September</strong>, which was, which is kind of late typically for finding an industrial placement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because that’s when your placement started or was about to start kind of thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Well, when my third year was there, you would have in September.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You would have been starting your third and final year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Exactly it was and I was kind of waiting on replies from three companies like around the end of August and I was really panicking honestly because I didn’t know where I was going for a star because I didn’t know what city I’d be in and I’d have to find accommodation.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.4</span> Finding a placement late at Disney+</h2>
<p>So what happens, the opportunity that came up was with Disney. Is that right? It was a Disney streaming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yeah, that was with Disney streaming, which is sort of the division within this knee, which is in charge of building out Disney Plus, the streaming service and they used to be based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockport">Stockport</a>, Manchester, see figure @ref(fig:disneyplus-fig). Well, they have an office here but they also have teams across the US and some other European cities and I somehow came across the around mid August. <strong>I think I’m not sure if it was from Duncan yourself sharing a post on LinkedIn or just some random friend, liking a post on LinkedIn</strong>, but basically one of their recruiters made a post on LinkedIn saying that they were looking for students for placements, but like they started really their process really late because it was their first time doing it because of the impact of COVID. So I thought, might as well give a shot. Right? And I applied and I got in and that was kind of my saving grace to my placement year.</p>

They’re just people who’ve graduated for like five years and it’s still think they can apply. After that there was a technical challenge, I believe in my case it was a hackerrank. (see section @ref(hackerrank)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So open-ended thing where you went, you were given a task and given a like, was this against the clock or you given a period of time which to go away and complete it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: I don’t exactly remember, I think this hack around was like a two-hour one but it was kind of an open on the task. I don’t think I can really go into the details but it was more of a scenario task I’d say. So it’s not the typical algorithms or complexity question which you might get other companies. It was more of a specific use case within Disney Plus and you had to sort of build out a simple version of a certain feature</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and kind of say what you do next what you’re yes. Sounds a little bit like a in a way you get these sort of situational judgement questions in an interview where you’re given a scenario. This is a quite concrete scenario so it’s not theoretical scenario.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yeah, I mean I think I like this better than situation all judgement questions because those seem to be a bit more sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources">HR-ey</a>, I guess not really technical. Whereas this was like an actual technical question, right? It was kind of similar to some of the first year labs, I’d say, right? But yeah, so after submitting this, I got invited to a final round with, to engineers, I believe, where we kind of went over my background went over my submission for the hackerank and why I made certain design decisions and why I chose to implement it that specific way. They also pointed out some suggestions on how could have improved my code for example, and basically it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose a sort of unusual thing about that for a lot of students is they’re not used to having other people look at their code. For a start, the other thing you’re not used to is sort of discussing and you know you happen to justify design decisions you make yes you wouldn’t do in an exam scenario. You just come up with an answer. Yeah. And maybe you try and justify it, but it’s kind of, you know, it’s a very different kind of process where definitely you’re there’s a bit more sort of thinking out loud going on in a lot of technical interviews where you can sort of explain your reasoning. It’s like the classic thing in maths where you show, you’re working kind of thing. How you got there? Which is sometimes just as important as whatever solution you came up with I guess</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: It’s more important than the solution because first of all, they kind of want to see that you actually came up with a solution and didn’t copy it, or have someone else do it for you, which surprisingly enough is a thing. And also, the part about speaking out loud, I think it’s like the most important part of doing interviews, because when you’re coding, you might be having certain thoughts in your head, but other people don’t really know why you’re doing things that way. So why you use the <code>for loop</code> instead of a <code>while loop</code> for example and yeah, I’d say speaking out loud and just saying what you’re thinking is key to succeed in most of coding interviews</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s testing how well you communicate because its not just what the solution is or how you how you came to that solution but this and how you are articulate that solution to somebody who I guess the people you were talking to were both technical so you could talk technical stuff with them but it’s as much about how you say it and how you articulate as to what not what your specific answer is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yeah,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So then after the interview you were offered the job straight away? Was there a delay or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: there was a bit of a delay because I think one of the recruiters there are two working on recruiting placement students. I think one of the recruiters went on annual leave or something. So, it was an anxious, wait, weekend of, like, five days in total because I was really panicking on that point. And then I got the call to tell me actually got a job which was a relief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. And I think it’s kind of, especially at that time of year when there’s so much uncertainty and that time of year you’re thinking, I’m gonna go see. The thing is you’re thinking about your third year project and am I going to go into third year or not? A stressful thing. So you start a Disney and was that entirely online? Was it? I guess you would have met people in an interview but it would have been a virtual interview right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yeah. So all them interviews were her held virtually over Zoom and the placement itself was all online due to COVID. I was still based in Manchester, but the entire Disney streaming office was all working remotely. I think to this day they still haven’t reopened and everyone’s just been working remotely, which I guess is one of the few perks to come out of the pandemic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you ever get to meet these people physically?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: So, during April, I had the opportunity to go down to the Disney office in London for a volunteering thing on one of the days. So, funnily enough, I met some of the people from the London office, which were from the main Disney company. In terms of my co-workers, I got to meet some of them because I think around May, when lockdown measures were starting to ease and people could go out for drinks and have lunch, I met some of those. I think that’s one of the downsides of working remotely during a pandemic. You don’t really get to interact with people that much because you only see them in meetings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not it’s not the same as bumping into people in the corridor over like you would in a physical environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="brian-blockchain" class="section level2" number="30.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.5</span> Final year project</h2>
<p>So you came back to your final year, a year later and you did a project can you tell us a little bit about what your final year project which you’ve just finished has been about, is it something related or something completely different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: So, it’s something completely unrelated. Um, during my time at Disney, I rotated between two teams, one of the teams was an SRE team so that’s like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering">Site Reliability Engineering</a>, which is kind of like DevOps and making sure that developers can deploy applications smoothly etc. And then I was another team, which was more in charge of experimentation. So, there’s a concept in deploying products, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B testing</a>, which is where you test out two different versions of a feature for example, or what page, to two different groups of people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Randomly assigned?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yes and I was working on a team you sort of gather statistics about is a green button better or a blue button, better for the audience. But yeah, I was working on a team, which was building an internal tool to solve, like randomised the customers to split them and gather statistics. And then when I came back, my project is a blockchain-based voting system which has absolutely nothing to do with that but it was a self-proposed project because it’s a field I’m interested in, right? Like, when I was sort of looking for a placement I had already proposed this project just in preparation in case I needed to do third year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right? Okay, yeah, so it’s quite good quite good experience proposing an own project. I think because it’s not it’s a certain kind of skill, right? Pitching, saying enough about your project, that it sounds like it’s something “meaty” you can get just teeth stuck into.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yeah, definitely. I’d say if you’re particularly interested in a certain field and can’t really find an option, you like, you could just propose your own to supervisors who are in that field. So, if you’re interested in machine learning or like something specific to machine learning, you could always propose your own, which is great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you say, you found a supervisor to supervise a blockchain project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yeah. So for me, I kind of was looking at the blockchain projects that were available in the list of projects, and then I found some supervisors who were in the field and then I proposed to them, directly, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how did that go? Did you enjoy? It was a fun digging into it because that’s but one of the big differences between doing a third year project and doing commercial projects is you don’t have a customer. Yes, you don’t have users, you have to worry about so you can be a bit more experimental and just kind of dig into things because they look interesting. So how did you find that process? Was that something you enjoyed? Or was it actually quite hard work</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: I’d say it was fascinating because I’d split the work of computer science into three categories</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>one being sort of theoretical stuff that you get taught in lecturers and different subjects.</li>
<li>One being more practical hands-on skills that you do in modules like software engineering or when you actually do your placement</li>
<li>but then well I guess it depends on your project but many projects to solve have a more academic side to it where you actually have to delve into what people have done in the past in that field. Do some literature review and do some reading and then solve review what they’ve done or trying to come up with something new and original on your own.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>So I’d say it was definitely fascinating for me. And like so a good break from usual, uni work, especially because I proposed my own project and something I’m interested in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, it’s often more motivating. Isn’t it? When it’s your baby basically. Definitely use your idea and you kind of you’re interested in it before you started. So you kind of that that’s something that keeps you going throughout the year. Makes it otherwise it can be quite hard working on a project. You don’t enjoy. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. So that’s that brings us up to now so you you literally just finished. Now you’ve got some exams</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: I am currently in the middle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for coming and speaking to me during exams. I hope no too stressful. And then you finish, I guess, what? In a couple of weeks time, something like that. I say how many exams you got? Three, two, three exams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: I’ve got three so I should finish in round two weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are your plans after that, you have any concrete plans at the moment. Next step?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: So I am not going to do a master’s yet. I think I do have two job offers lined up, which I actually have to decide between and get back to them right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that an easy decision to make? How do you know? It’s a dilemma that I see with placements and internships. If you’ve got multiple offers, it’s like, you know, how do you, how do you work out? Which is the best for you. That’s quite that’s quite difficult problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: I think that’s a great question. So, as many things you need to take in this into account and first of all, the most obvious one is compensation because that is a big factor and honestly being a Manchester graduate and having relatively higher grades, I’d say, I think people should kind of know what they’re worth and not undersell themselves (see section @ref(undersell)) because some companies will just try and take advantage of graduate students because they don’t know how much they are worth We’re actually worth more than you think I’d say. Um, but also you should take into account the company culture and if you’ve already had an internship with placement there, whether you actually like working there and how people there operate and what the kind of vibe is, and I guess also location because in my case, one of the offers and Manchester one is in London, which is obviously a difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Especially in terms of the cost of living but also in terms of things you can do Yes. Yeah, different. It’s different. No, right or wrong answer there. I think it’s depends on the side on what you say. You don’t have to name the companies if you’re still deciding between them, but I guess it, you know, it’s in it is quite a big decision in it because it’s like something that shapes what comes after. The same way as taking a placement shapes, what follows on from that. So and yeah, is remote work, I mean, so it’s a changed world that we’re in now. Is hybrid working a sort of the norm in both of those companies or they expect you’ve been in the office?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: that’s a great point. So, both of them are quite flexible. In this regard. I’d say neither of them expect me to be in the office every day but one of the perks is one of the companies does let me work from abroad a certain amount of days per year. Which is quite attractive to me because personally I like travelling</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being in sunny places like somewhere outside the UK!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yes, exactly. So the higher flexibility there is kind of a big perk for me, so I’m trying to decide between that, but say across the whole industry, post COVID, I’d say generally companies are more open to flexible working many. Many companies are doing kind of three days from home and two days in the office or the opposite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone’s still figuring this out like how its going to work in the longer run as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yes, especially because so many companies, employees, have realised that big like employees can actually work from home. And it’s also good for the company because they also have to rent out less office space I guess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember visiting students at <a href="https://www.arm.com/">ARM.com</a> on placement and there were and a lot of software engineering, a lot of companies, working software, and technology, and hardware already using zoom for meeting. We’re doing you know remote collaboration. Where you’re you’re teams are software, engineers are distributed around the globe. So, you <strong>had</strong> to do this hybrid working because a lot of your meetings would be people young different times zone and so, and they switch sort of straight away because that’s what they’d always been doing. But other companies has been a bit of a bigger adaptation I think?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yeah, it’s usually not an issue, sort of at smaller companies or sort of newer companies like startups. But I’d say it’s more of an issue in big sort of slow-moving organisations, like banks. But most startups or like, sort of tech driven companies will have little no issue with you working at home or whatever but like banks might still want until I used to come in just because of the physical presence and their traditions I guess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah and if you I guess you depends a little bit on how customer facing you are as well. If you’re not dealing with customers. Then sometimes that gives you a bit more flexibility to where you where you work. So besides the works, you’re planning on having a break because I guess this year’s been quite gruelling in some ways. You’re having you having mentioned takes some time off before you start. Yeah, going straight into it. The minute you walk out your last exam.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: No, so, both of my graduate offers start in September thankful. So I will enjoy my last summer to the fullest extent, but a travelling maybe or yes, good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, a couple questions you through the end. So, if you think back to it seems like such a long time ago now, 2018 and it is, it’s especially a long time, just because so much has happened in the last four years with coronavirus and everything else. So if you were, what would, what advice would you give to first and second year students are starting out in computer science? What would you, What would you advise them to do in finding out what is they’re going to do with their lives while they’re at university?</p>
</div>
<div id="brian-time" class="section level2" number="30.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.6</span> Advice to your former self</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: So I’m gonna be honest here. I think there’s two obvious paths you can take after university. One is obviously getting a job. Well, typically, in the same fields, working as a software engineer or data scientist, or whatever, and the other path is sort of more academic. So you might want to go into do some more further research. Other in terms of a masters or a PhD and certain fields like machine learning. I’d say, if you are not interested in academia, although your opinions might change throughout your degree obviously, but if you’re not interested in you just more interested in working in software engineering, I’d say start early. And this is both in terms of knowing people also learning soft skills, such as how to communicate with other developers and also participating in things like career events held by the UniCS (<a href="https://unicsmcr.com/">unicsmcr.com</a>) society. If you’re in second year, I would strongly recommend going to PASS2 just for career advice and information about how to structure your CV,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peer Assisted Study Scheme <a href="https://www.peersupport.manchester.ac.uk/">www.peersupport.manchester.ac.uk</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: PASS is our peer assisted scheme, where third-year students give weekly sessions to coach, second year, students on things like, both in terms of, like course, unit choices but also a lot of focus on industrial experience. I’d say so how to actually what you’ve been doing as a PASS. Yes. So I meant might be slightly violentator, is it? I guess what leader I need it probably is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you’ve been passing on the advice. Yes, that you’ve had it when weekly sessions to students. Yeah, something like eyeballing their CV having a quick look.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yeah, definitely. I’d say getting your CV up to scratche one of the first crucial steps into getting an internship or placement because especially if you’re from abroad because you’re not might not be used to the format of CVs used in the UK for example. But of course Duncan has always a great resource</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would say its a lot like code. The more people that see your CV the better it’s like code the more people that see your code the more time, you know the less bugs. I’ll be many you know lots of people say it they’ll be able to squash whatever bugs there maybe in your CV.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian Exactly. Because everyone will have different opinions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’ll probably all disagree with each other, as well!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Not necessarily, I mean, there’s common things, but yeah and also just prepare early in terms of interview preparation, for example, again, we will, you probably learn about this in PASS2, but also talk to Duncan because he has a lot of knowledge about applying to jobs, right to say that I mean practical stuff.</p>

<div id="brian-gayle" class="section level2" number="30.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">30.7</span> Cracking the coding interviews</h2>
<p>Like did you do much in the terms of like hackerrank exercises (see section @ref(hackerrank)) or you know, the <em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em> up there by Gayle Lackmann McDowell, see section @ref(blackhole). <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cracking">McDowell 2015</a>)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: That’s a controversial book. Let’s just say, yes, it’s a very complete guide to approach your interviews, but it might be something <strong>too</strong> complete and too long.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can be a little bit daunting if you’re preparing for technical interview.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yeah</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might look at that and think, oh my god, I’ve got to know all this stuff!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: If you’re trying to get into like large tech companies, companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, but not, I guess then definitely sort of treat that as your Bible. I’d say and just grind, hackerrank and leetcode because that’s pretty much all they will ask. Personally, I’m not a fan of the style of the questions they ask because it’s basically just memorising algorithms and memorising data structures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I think there’s a lot more to being a software engineer than just knowing algorithms</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: definitely because like once you get the job, you’re not going to be expected to recite the complexity of a certain algorithm. You can just Google it. There’s a lot of transferable skills you can have as a software engineer such as like picking up a language quickly, which I personally think is more important but if you do want to get into those companies do grind hackerrank and leetcode. If you don’t maybe do some but don’t do all your time to it because you also have things like coursework you’re in second year which is more important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah and having a life as well at college difficult thing. I mean, can you say a little bit about that? How did you, how did you manage to do work-life balancing because it’s difficult, isn’t it? I mean it’s perhaps been especially difficult in coronavirus because you’ve been stuck at home or in you know in a company accommodation where you’ve been working and that’s been your personal space as well and it’s putting those boundaries between work and life is really quite challenging.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: Yes so take care of your mental health. I think that’s very important to say that we’re released and in terms of balancing work and just not work in general. Obviously when you’re at uni, that might be a bit difficult. But like if you’re on an internship or placement just log off whenever your time is up honestly. If you’re contracted to do a certain number of hours, don’t do free over time, like there’s no point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this is where offices are nice, because you kind of generally know that when you’re in an office you’re working. Hopefully. Yeah. So when you’re not in an office, that’s time when you shouldn’t be working. Obviously again those boundaries have been blurred but yeah, you kind of I mean, I found when I was a student a long time ago, as I had, I just used to go for the library just because I knew that when I was in the library I was working. And when I wasn’t in the library I wasn’t working and it was just easier for me to manage that way. But I guess everyone works differently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: yeah, definitely because I’m a person that doesn’t work that well from home. I kind of you like a separation like spatial separation between work and leisure I guess. So in terms of uni or why do is I go to the library or coming to Kilburn to work, and then there’s silver more, clear distinction between the two, which funnels the does kind of help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, good. Okay. I think we’ve covered anything everything. Is there any other anything else that you wanted to talk about? I think that you’d like to share with students and your role as a PASS leader and as a computer science graduate, generally, for anyone studying computing at wherever university, they happen to be at?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess, one of the things is just don’t undersell yourself (see section @ref(undersell)) BECAUSE software engineers are in high demand, even if you’re not like the best of the best, you still shouldn’t undersell yourself and know your worth. Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how, I mean, how did you find out about salaries? Where were you looking to find out about salary information to say, right? You trying to gauge how much you’re worth as a computer science graduate, where do you go?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian: So first of all, talk to people, if you’re around Kilburn, there’s probably a lot of people who have done internships or have come back from placements and generally if you ask them how much they were making, they probably be quite happy to answer or at least give you a range. Obviously this depends on the company and also the location. But this information can really help you gauge, whether you’re being sort of given a lower compensation. And you should, for example, there’s also online resources, like <a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/">glassdoor.co.uk</a> or I think <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">levels.fyi</a> which has pretty detailed information on many tech companies and what salaries or salary ranges that offer in people with different experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then you know, you know you know understanding or I mean the other one is overselling yourself, right? You can cut yourself out by asking for too much compensation, but I think the converse is more often likely to happen because companies are always trying to get the best they can, th most they can for the least amount of money. Yeah. So they’re always going to try and get graduates for you know the lowest price. They can exactly big enough to get them drawn into come and work for them. But then low enough that they can save money there.</p>
<p>Okay, good. Well, thank you. Brian for coming in today. It’s good to speak to you. And I wish you the best of luck with whatever, whichever, those two companies that you choose in the future. And thanks again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brian. Thank you Duncan, it’s been a pleasure.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.1</span> What’s your story Jason?</h2>
<p>So welcome Jason. Thank you for joining the show. And I wanted to talk to you a little bit about what your journey’s been from before you started studying here to now four years later. There’s a lot has happened in the last four years so tell us a little bit about how you came to study computer science. So can you tell us a little bit about yourself and where you from? Where you studied, where you studied before you came to Manchester?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Yeah, so yeah, London through and through born and raised in London, living in London my whole life. Ethnically, I’m Nigerian. So my parents were born and studied in Nigeria before moving over here later and in terms of locations in London, I’m from East London. So it’s like my main stomping ground. I guess I’ll talk about how I got into computer science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
</div>
<div id="jason-why" class="section level2" number="31.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.2</span> Why study Computer Science?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: I’d say the main way, computers are kind of is a weird one and I tell people the story, they don’t really believe me, but I actually didn’t really have much of an interest in computer science at school until I got to sixth form</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you do it (computer science) as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-level">A level</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll get to that. That’s part of the story. So I did, I did computer science and economics at GCSE those two that I chose. And essentially I really liked economics. I found it really interesting. And yeah, I wanted to take that further. I was kind of a <strong>finance bro’</strong> so to speak. I was really interested. I wanted to see where I could take it, but the problem was that when GCSEs were done and dusted, there were some issues with the teacher, our teacher, teaching us wrong parts of the spec and stuff like that. Essentially the grade I got in the final GCSE exam was lower than what I needed for the sixth form I would eventually be moving to off the back of those grades, if that makes sense. So my plan was kind of to get my GCSE and to move to like a like a more, a better sixth form. So I could get better education for A levels but the problem is that due to, you know, issues of the teaching and whatnot, the grade wasn’t as high as it needed to be for me to take that subject at A level at the sixth form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: So you know, originally I wanted to do physics, maths and economics, you know I was planning on going down the finance route. Yeah, but yeah, they wouldn’t let me do it. So I thought okay what’s the next best thing or something? I enjoy and something I found pretty you know, easy at GCSE: computer science. I found I liked it, I enjoyed it. I found it pretty straightforward. I got, I think I got one of the highest marks in my year, for computer science, at GCSE. So, you know, that’s pretty confident, I could, you know, do it and, you know, it makes sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, you did physics, maths and computer science?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Exactly. So I started that and yeah, that’s really enjoy that. I grew to really love it. You know I got sided, you know, picking up getting prop learning how to code properly because, you know, the code you do at GCSE is very rudimentary and yeah, that kind of took me to university. I discovered computers. That’s kind of came to me. It’s kind of, by chance because if my sixth form had allowed me to do economics, I don’t think I’d be here today. So yeah, it’s pretty crazy, pretty crazy, but yeah,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it’s doing A level that made, you think, actually, this is an interesting subject I like to do. I’d like to take further than just A-level.</p>

<p>Jason: exactly</p>

<p>Okay, interesting. So, and then so your story your arrived here, four years ago, you’ve done a three-year bachelor’s degree with a year in industry. So can you tell us a little bit about that journey? I think you you did a placement at Morgan Stanley, wasn’t it initially (see figure @ref(fig:morgan-stanley2-fig))? You started looking for that beginning of your second year. So you tell us a little bit about how you found the job and that whole process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Yeah. Essentially, just a ton of applications. I mean, I think the main thing for me, I wanted to keep my horizons pretty broad. I wanted to make sure I didn’t limit myself to just tech companies or limit myself to any kind of niche. So and I always found finance pretty interesting how that mentioned before, you know, I always had that always had that prior finance interest. So essentially I was applying for you know, traditional tech companies, investment banks and yeah, after a bunch of applications I was able to get to the final round, the assessment centre of Morgan Stanley. I managed to smash that and then you know, got called in to do the placement. So that was yeah scheduled to be a year but obviously was caught a month short because of COVID. You know it’s funny because I literally started in the middle of COVID.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>So that was all online I guess?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Exactly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Were you in London or Manchester?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: I’m back and forth. I mean coming up here, see some friends, do some work, why not? And yeah, so I only go to go into the office in the last, maybe two months of the placements, right? It was a bit, not ideal, but, I mean, you know, life gives you lemons, you make lemonade right? So, just took it for it was, and still managed have a really great experience off the back of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did, you do a rotation? Did you do two six months (rotations)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: I spent six months with the equity derivatives team, so that’s working on like, I mean, not to get too jargony but essentially derivatives are like a type of financial product and I was with the equity derivative team, so like traditional like stocks and options and whatnot. So I was working on technology. That would essentially basically automate the process of passing requests for different financial products coming into the firm. So it was kind of like an NLP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing</a>) type project where clients will be able to kind of use chat system that Morgan Stanley had available and then some automated passing would be applied to their messages to basically determine like what product they want. Yeah. So that was the first rotation and the second rotation was with the FX flow team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FX is?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: So that’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market">foreign exchange</a> for “forex”. Forex essentially. So. Yeah, working like the currency, the currency exchange system systems and stuff like that. So yeah. I was able to learn, you know, a lot on both sides. I think the first one, the first rotation was kind of like a research. You type project what else kind of doing you know, some AI type stuff. Second rotation was more of a this traditional softeng role, I was kind of clearing out tickets. Just helping out of different bits and bobs, didn’t really do anything, but specifically, I kind of just part of the software engineering team and this helped out and then I guess after my placement actually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So back to, because this is quite interesting for now economics. So a lot of people who do software engineering placements in banks like Morgan Stanley, Investment banks, like Morgan Stanley won’t necessarily have any financial knowledge. So, how useful was your economics?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: GCSE?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your general interest in it, as well. Some some engineers have little or no interest in economics. It’s just well, this is a, this is a place where they do software engineering (and pay good salaries) so I’ll work there. How useful is the economics interest in helping you with that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: It was really helpful because I already knew a lot of what they were talking about. At least the the basic ideas of what is a stock? What is a bond? What is this? What is that? That made that a lot easier and then additions that I took <em>Fundamentals of Finance</em> in my in the second semester of university kind of in, not to the placement. So that allowed me to kind of like top up on my knowledge and make sure I kind of knew that at least some of the basic concepts. So, but even once I started, people are really like happy to explain stuff to you and explain concepts to you. So one thing, one thing I really the point of doing was to schedule meetings with the finance side of, you know. So basically any people, the finance people would work with because kind of the way things work in Morgan Stanley is kind of the tech teams are separate from the finance teams but you usually have a couple points of contact where you can kind of, get clarification on, you know, the requirements of what you’re building or something like that. So I was able to kind of talk to finance, people. Get a better idea of what was going on as well. Talk to the people on, on my side, on the tech side to you knew what’s going on. I’m from there. You know, I think I think one thing I’d say to people is that I think even if you don’t have much finance knowledge, it’s less about what you know when you start a more about what you’re you know, willing to work. You’re willing to put the work in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being able to understand the business is always beneficial. You’re not just a techie to write code, in a back room somewhere. You need to understand the business requirements and what they mean and how a business people see it, or how the traders see it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Morgan Stanley is quite good with that, I mean there’s training the first week you do like group training and where you get like a bunch of different talks. So there’s tech specific talks, we’re like which are just going to take people’s understand that the tech stack and stuff and then there’s general finance talks which are basically just you know what is an investment bank? You know, what does that mean? What is the buy and sell side and whatever?</p>

</div>
<div id="jgoogle" class="section level2" number="31.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.4</span> Google</h2>
<p>So, following on from your placement, you’ve got a summer internship which was remote as well?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: COVID, the gift that keeps on giving! So that was, I did some internship with Google (see figure @ref(fig:google-alphabet-fig)) which was actually yeah. It was a story that one. I’ve always been pretty ambitious. So for me like the placement I wasn’t dead set amongst only obviously I did really find finance interesting but I wanted to hedge my bets and see, you know, after I think I finished a place with about three or four months to spare before I started university again. So I figured if I have that time and COVID is still a thing, I’m not gonna be going anywhere. So I might as well, you know, do an internship. So I was applying to, you know, a bunch of different places like Facebook, Bloomberg, a couple hedge funds. I was interviewing alongside the placement, which was pretty tough to be fair because preparing while working a full-time job. Really. Difficult a lot of late nights. Well, you know, I’d log off work and then turn around and be up, like, hackerrank (see section @ref(hackerrank)) and leetcode (see section @ref(leetcode)). But yeah, like, we’ll see. It worked in my favour.</p>

<p>Do you think you could have got that job at Google without the Morgan Stanley experience. Having that bit of experience helps because they’ll ask you about situations: in my current job I’m doing this and that can help. Whereas, I think going from zero to Google is a big ask for a lot of people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: exactly. It definitely helps I’d say just from especially from a confidence perspective because by the time I’d even started applying and interviewing I had maybe five months under my belt with Morgan Stanley. So I was pretty confident in my abilities. I’ve gotten great feedback from my managers and everyone I’d worked with, put up with me pretty well. So from a conference effective and also from like a this in terms of my actual technical ability, I would definitely a lot stronger than I would have been. <strong>One of the biggest reasons I recommend doing a placement to people was it allows you to tie together all the different concepts you learn in the bachelors</strong> you kind of you pick up all (these) different concepts, but they come at you so fast. You don’t have time to stop and figure out where they will, where what they mean relative to each other. I was able to get really competent and that made into the interviewing process like pretty straightforward. I got to pretty much everywhere I applied to, but you know, Google ended up coming through first. So I was pretty happy with that, basically the best company I could ask for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What were you doing at Google? I mean, I guess there’s probably stuff you can’t talk about but generally, what were you doing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: So yeah, I guess I was working with the Fitbit team. Fitbit, for those that might not know, was acquired by Google at the start of 2021. So that was literally a couple months before I started having they were acquired February or I think March 2021 and I started like July 2021. So right Fitbit hasn’t actually been a part of Google for very long. It was like a Google internship but at the same time a Fitbit internships I kind of got a bit of both</p>
</blockquote>
<p>interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Yeah it’s a bit weird because their systems hadn’t been fully integrated with Google systems yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So migrating things</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: a lot of moving parts, lot of things going on. So I got to work with some Google people. Some people who don’t know anything about Google or just with Fitbit, all they know is Fitbit, they are part of Google Now. So it was interesting and regards the actual technical details of the project I worked on, it’s basically a smartwatch app so I was working on app for an upcoming Fitbit smartwatch. I can’t go into details about what the app does but …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google watch!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: essentially so that was that was really cool. Yeah. Got to I’ve never done it kind of like smartwatch app development or even like that before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s quite low level stuff was it? A bit of web application stuff but talking to to the hardware?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: So basically the application star so designing that Google’s really big on making sure your design is solid first before you start coding. So I couldn’t even really do any coding for the first month of the internship. I did like a little bits here and there to get a feel. So did a lot of like app design stuff. Figuring out what it would look like on the smartwatch, what it should do in addition to some low-level stuff to actually do some new hardware. There were some new hardware functionality, that was coming to the watch that they were bringing bringing out that we wanted to make use of. But the problem was, there were no existing interfaces, like API interfaces between the code and the hardware for that particular piece of functionality. So, on top of having to design the app I also had to design that API from scratch. Thankfully I had access to the source code for the Fitbit SDK like at development SDK. I was able to dig into that and grab what I needed and glue stuff together and figure out with help from my manager. Thankfully the project was good because I got a feel for both the app design stuff and also the low level. How do I actually make this work from a hardware perspective? What should the API look like and I was left to do that by myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good experience!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: It was really good experience.</p>

<div id="jfinalyear" class="section level2" number="31.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.5</span> Final year</h2>
<p>So when you come back to university, after your two placements and internships, you came back to do your final year here and you essentially trying to pull all things all together. So what did you do? Your final year project on what?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason My final year project was a hand, gesture recognition system. It was an exploration the feasibility of making a really portable easy to use hand gesture recognition (system) that can use any machine, any architecture whatever. It evolved to taking a lot of existing technologies and bringing them all together. And yeah, one of the technologies I use is actually developed by Google called <a href="https://google.github.io/mediapipe/">media pipe</a> which I made use of to perform the hand tracking and feature extraction, which I then use a neural network to classify</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So taking some sort of video feed?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Exactly. So essentially a video feed being passed for if hands present inside the view of the camera features like strategies are basically just points on the hand and then that’s fed into a neural network, which basically tells you okay, what gestures being performed. The idea is that I would create both create a really robust and lightweight system that can be used anywhere and also use it and apply it to a particular use case that improves the user experience, both from disabled and able-bodied people. So I took that and then used it with used with Spotify to make a music player which has allow you to increase and decrease volume. That was that essentially what I did,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good and so again, it gave you a chance to dig into a bit more AI stuff you haven’t done a huge amount of up until that point?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I’d done a bit on the course but I wanted to see what I could do to make AI work for me and just do my own thing with it, be creative with it because nothing like this had really been done before, especially using the technologies I was using. So that was the most interesting aspect of it. So I’m bringing all the different pieces together and seeing what if you could actually improve these experience for something which, yeah, which was proven to be the case, with some user surveys. I did with able-bodied and disabled people. I was pretty pleased about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s all done. You’ve literally just come from your presentation. So that’s the end, your last thing, your last formal thing before graduation. So and what are your plans for the future. What? What comes next? What comes after?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason So the plan is, thankfully, I’ve received a return offer for both Morgan Stanley and Google, but I went with Google just because it aligns more with what I want to do long-term.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In London?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Yes, so I’ll be starting with Google in October later this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: thank you so much. I’m just gonna take the summer easy, gonna be travelling, taking it easy a bit before after, you know, enter the working world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s quite a rare opportunity to get that much time off when once you’re working, you don’t get three months off do you!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: exactly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enjoy it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: All my placement money is going on this essentially. Longer term than that, I’d still find finance quite interesting. I think a part of me will always be interested in doing something that blends both tech and finance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was looking at Apple, who have been in the headlines recently because their pay system. They are behaving more more like a bank. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-applegoldman">Bradshaw et al. 2022</a>)</span></p>

<p>Jason: Oh yeah, yeah, expansions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay">Apple Pay</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’ve been partnered with Goldman Sachs, But now they’re doing everything on their own. Thats’s an interesting space what’s happening there. Who knows what the future will look like? What is a bank going to look like in the future?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Yeah, exactly that. <strong>Everything’s just gonna be one big tech company</strong>! Maybe I should move to finance in a couple years. I love to you know maybe because like maybe a hedge fund, the work on like tech stuff there or go to kind of something more small to medium size. Like some kind of like fintech startup that kind of thing. Maybe that’d be cool. Like maybe three, four years from now. For the time being starting my career with Google and I’ll see how well that goes</p>

<div id="jminority" class="section level2" number="31.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">31.6</span> Minority report</h2>
<p>To finish up then, this bit is called <em>Minority Report</em> so I’d be interested as you are a member of a minority group, you’re black. I’d be interested to hear about what your experiences have been of being black in computer science but being black in the university but then also in the workplace as well. What’s that been like, honestly? What could the university do? And what could we perhaps we in computer science do to make it more welcoming. It’s difficult being in a minority for lots of different reasons. And then, perhaps what employers can do as well? Perhaps you could say a little bit about, Morgan Stanley and Google are both, keen to improve diversity in their workforce, but it’s it’s an uphill battle for everyone. Any thoughts on that and what how we can do it better in the future?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: I think it’s more just a case of my experience has been good. Like I’ve never felt, you know, out of place. I made plenty of friends on the course. I think the main thing is just there are very few black people in my yeargroup. I’ve been one of the first thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How many?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: I think when I first started in first year, my placement has shifted me away from some people. I think maybe about three or four people total</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of a total of 250 or so?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Yeah, similar at Morgan Stanley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was there more diversity?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was but not much. I think in general I’m pretty used to being the only black person in the room or being close enough to it. I mean there were some other like a black people at the company,, I was able to get meetings on the board with but oh but particularly in in the tech space not that many having only only a few but I’ve made a lot of new contacts and that were black. In general, I’d say the problem isn’t necessarily how I mean, bloody won’t treat anything different. I think, especially in our part of the world, we’re pretty far past that like nobody’s, I think until I have never experienced any kind of prejudice, like while I was at work or anything like that but I’d say the main issue is just getting more people, more black people into that. These kind of spaces. So, like, especially considering that from like a socio-economic perspective people from my background don’t tend to go to higher education or to even study computer science and to get into tech. So, I say the biggest thing, you know, both campuses and companies can do just keep them when they’re doing. Keep trying to get more black people into these spaces and from a university respective, I’d say more could be done for regardless of that kind of helping with the financial aspects of university, offering more scholarships and bursaries and this, and that just kind of doing more to kind of ease the transition that makes sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Yeah</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason it can be a financial problem for a lot of people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because I think computer science, regardless, whatever your gender or race or whatever. I thin computer science, sometimes people don’t feel like they belong, right? So it’s kind of making people feel like you belong here, whoever you are, and whatever your background, whatever you’re interested in. Computer science is a subject that is for everyone. And it doesn’t quite have that appeal or maybe no subject does really truly, but making it more appealing to a wider group of people would be beneficial for everyone. Difficult to get there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Yeah, exactly. But yeah, in general, I’d say that experience has been I think in university in general, think the UoM I think the stats are like, less than 3% of the student population is like black or anything like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the proportion in computer science pretty much reflects that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason Yeah, university. Exactly. This aren’t many black people in.</p>

<p>The thing that really hit me was when you were in Morgan Stanley and you posted something on LinkedIn <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jasontimes">Ozuzu 2020</a>)</span> with your picture in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square">Times Square</a> (New York, see figure @ref(fig:timesq-fig)).</p>

<p>I’ve visited investment banks and that was when it kind of hit me. I hadn’t realised, how white it was until I saw your face and thought, oh my god, that’s Jason!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Ha ha</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, I recognise him. How white that world is, its a very privileged world, there’s lots of money but it’s also very very white.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Exactly. And I think, I think that could hold some people from, like my kind of background back, people might grow up in like pretty black areas. A lot of people, their schools, all kind of look like them. And then they kind of shunted into the professional environment and they’re not even, they haven’t really had many interactions right people in general. Yeah. So that can be that can be issue for some people as well. Like thankfully I went to a pretty like diverse school. I got a pretty good mix of people at my school. I know people who like, in London they went to schools which would maybe night, 80 or 90% black. So it’s kind of like when they do kind of come to university and kind of leave that bubble, it’s they can feel bit out of place. Yeah, that can definitely be an issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know in the US they have universities that are much more traditionally black, (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities">Historically black colleges and universities</a> (HBCUs)) and we don’t again really have that is kind of yeah, strange on that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Yeah. But I’m a big believer of different people mixing together and like, kind of, yeah. So I mean, in my opinion, I don’t even think we’d even really need put like black campuses or anything like that. I think the biggest thing is just, just adding more diversity. You’re getting a bigger mix of people and yeah. Yeah. But that’s obviously something that has to be done over the very long.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Part of it is role models, as well, people can see. Oh, you know. This is possible. Something people can then. Did you do any work with schools? Well, I know Morgan Stanley does quite a lot of work with schools. Did you do any? They do stuff in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets">Tower Hamlets</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: I would have if it was in person but COVID there wasn’t really much, I can’t do. I was eager to, but I think when I go back to London, one thing I want to do is kind of start going to kind of like in the city schools and show. Like I’m just a regular guy from London. Regular black guy from London, like, nothing that crazy about me. I just worked pretty hard and managed to make something of this whole tech thing. So, yeah, I recommend all my friends, I’m always telling my friends, listen look at tech, tech is pretty good , pretty chill, you know, good money, you know, good work life balance. I would tell people, but I’m I think in addition to the racial thing, I say a briefing, the whole feel back from tech. And general. They kind of like what he is. It’s not an easy subject. It’s not easy thing to get into, but I think people think it’s like impossible to get into you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have to be a genius programmer!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: I tell people. Oh yeah, I’m starting with Google. You must be amazing. You must be a genius. NO I’m not I’m not, I work pretty hard and you know I’m competent. I know what I’m doing but I’m not crazy. I’m not autistic. You know, specialists of anything really? I’m just find it interesting. I’ve worked hard and acquired skill that was good enough to know work at these companies. So that’s what I tell people, you know? It’s just, it’s okay. If you take your time, you’re willing to be consistent and you know do it as like a proper thing. I think <strong>a big thing of tech is that you kind of have to do it over long period of time and just gradually soaking all the skills.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my colleagues (<a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sattler/">Ulrike Sattler</a>) talks about learning, it’s like sedimentation. It’s like things settle slowly. You’re not just going to get it straight away. It might take months, maybe even years to get it. For some subjects to actually click.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: Exactly. What I think, a lot of people that I’ve spoken to try and get into tech and try and do coding. They could they do code for maybe like maybe two three weeks and then like yeah, I couldn’t figure out. All right. You kind of need to do. Maybe I think you can’t even say you’ve really given it a try until maybe six months. I say, three to six months of actual of graft and then maybe you can now, say, okay? Maybe this is or isn’t for me.</p>

Sometimes he’ll talk about spiritual things to talk about, the concept of the soul, and what it means like, life and death and stuff like that. You can get really deep like that. Or he might do stuff about social economic stuff and current issues and current problems we have in our society right now.

<p>All right. Well, thank you, Jason and is there any other closing comments before we finish? We have one here that was advice to your former self. So what would you tell your former self or a current first or second year student who is studying computer science. What should they focus on?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jason: I would say, the biggest thing is right, don’t sell yourself short. You don’t need to be a genius to work any of these places, why I’ve been telling people years below. You ask me about my experiences like you don’t need to be crazy. Just work hard and know what you’re talking about. Just be competent and believe. Honestly, have confidence, I think a big part of it is confidence. People kind of projects this idea of like, oh, I’m just not good enough to work at these places. And, you know, when people see me, I’m pretty outgoing pretty, like friendly guy. And they see me like, okay, I’m doing all the Morgan Stanley and Google, they think it kind of spins them a bit. They kind of think that in order to make make anything out yourself you need to give up life and do that make that your whole life. I mean, you have to work hard but I still go out on the weekend. I’ll still. I’ve got holidays lined up for the summer. I’m still doing my thing. So I think biggest, biggest piece of advice is have confidence and, you only and <strong>you only need one YES</strong></p>

<p>My guest today is Raluca Cruceru. I want to find out a little bit more about your story and your journey from arriving here. Four years ago, is that right? Three and a half years ago? Yeah, it was it three and a half years now, isn’t it? Can you tell us a little bit about yourself your name and where you’re from?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Yeah, of course. My name is Raluca Cruceru. I am 22 years old and originally from Romania. I came to the University of Manchester to study computer science. And here I am now in my final year.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="raluca-why" class="section level2" number="32.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">32.2</span> Why study Computer Science?</h2>
<p>(You’re) about to graduate and go off into the big wide world. So I think it’s always interested me hearing what made what made people study computer science so what was it that made want to study it? While you were doing your exams, applying to Manchester and what why did you study why did you choose to study computer science as a subject? Not why Manchester necessarily, but why computer science?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Well, I think that everything I’ve experienced before university connected together to my final decision, when I was a child, I was always interested into how computers work or what they work that they work, but of course at the time, everything was worried. But then in high school, it became more clear that I’m attracted to this idea of technology and computers. My class was focused on mathematics and informatics. So therefore, I was always into this kind of information. The solving problems became natural for me I could spend hours doing that. So at the end of the high school, it was obvious that I wanted to do something concerning Computer Science and Mathematics. And it was a decision between mathematics and computer science. And I chose computer science because it felt like something that could be used in more circumstances in more industries, and more linked to the general technology. Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So did you I guess, did you do you must have done a fair amount of computer science at high school did you do much in the way of coding in high school or was it more more focused on the mathematics?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: It was focused on the mathematics but then we also started to code in high school, and I think this is actually what helped me a lot to realise that they want you to do computer science. Also one of my exams that I chose at the at the end of my high school was boring informatics. I kind of fell in love with this idea. So yeah, yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, how did you go about deciding whether that was something that you wanted to do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Initially, I didn’t know about this option to have one year experience in industry. But when I found about it, I was really excited because I think for myself, the hands on experience, very important. And of course, we did all the way behind and all the lessons but I really wanted to understand what software engineering job actually requires. So as soon as I found out about this option, I was motivated to take it. I started to search for possibilities.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">32.3</span> Web Applications UK, now Koder.ly</h2>
<p>So this typically, most people are looking for placement style that are getting their second year. So after you’ve done the first year, so what sort of what sort of places did you apply to and what you were looking at lots of different things. You weren’t focused in on one, one or two places?</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Well, to be honest, I was very focused on CERN because I knew I wanted to work there. However, my I was very doubtful. Regarding my chances. I thought it was my only option. I applied for other companies in the UK. In places like CERN will expect you to have, or your application will stand out a lot more if you’ve got some experience like Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you’ve done a summer job Web applications UK, which is now called, they’ve changed their name now to <a href="https://www.koder.ly/">Koder.ly</a> with a <code>K</code> (see figure @ref(fig:koderly-fig)). So, you’ve got a broad exposure to different sorts of software engineering ideas, working in a team and that kind of stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Yeah, it really meant a lot because it’s one thing to work on a lab at university to be in another thing to work on something that you know, can impact a whole number of people. So it makes you want to do a good job. You know, that you’re, the stuff that you’re writing is is going to be used by hundreds, sometimes 1000s of people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that’s one of the satisfying things about software engineering is knowing that what you’ve made can get ended up getting used by lots of people</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: but stressful, stressful and exciting in my opinion, right? Yeah, there’s, there’s lots of places it can go wrong. Isn’t that I think when you’re building software,</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="cern" class="section level2" number="32.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">32.4</span> CERN</h2>
<p>okay, good. So, I think you mentioned you were particularly focused on CERN. I think they have two application rounds. Is that right? So you applied in the autumn?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: No, actually applied in the second one, from May onwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All right. So you didn’t you didn’t apply in the first round in autumn?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: In the second round in May,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess lots of people have heard a lot about CERN but what can tell us more about CERN as an organisation and what your what your role was, while you were a technical student there for a year?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: so the European organisation for Nuclear Research in Switzerland, and their main focus is on high energy physics research. They operate the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. The main focus is to unravel the mysteries of the universe, more specifically, how it was formed, and from from there to understand how it will evolve in the future. And the thing that attracted me the most was the fact that they push the frontiers of not only science, but technology computing, and also medical technology. And maybe a lot of people know that the <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/where-web-was-born">World Wide Web was created there in 1989</a> (see <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cailliau">Cailliau 2014</a>)</span> for web history and also birth of touchscreen technology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stumpe">Stumpe 2014</a>)</span>) And it’s interesting to know that I was to a university where we have a software that has no computers, and then go through the transition that created the World Wide Web. Like everything is connected. And, of course, I knew about since I was a child that I didn’t really imagine that there would actually work there. It was just like something to dream about when you go to sleep. But yeah, in the end, I got accepted. And I worked as a software engineer in the electrical engineering department. Basically, my task included building and maintaining software applications for the department for monitoring projects of cabling and fibre optics there. And I have several tasks to do, building technical panels that would extract and migrate information from different databases regarding this project. Then, a dashboard that was monitoring the project’s evolution and generating statistics regarding the quantities of cables for the radiation dose intake. And then after that, those two pieces were published on the department website, which I also maintained. So as you can see, there were a lot of tests and I learned very much how to be able to handle multitasking that time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing that thing that I think is perhaps most surprising about CERN is the fact that for every scientist they employ there are 10 engineers (see figure @ref(fig:cern2-fig)), and an awful lot of those engineers are software engineers, but you’ve also got the hardware and electrical engineering as well. So there’s an awful lot of engineering that goes on.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: I mean, it’s a big, it’s a big machine underground, basically, isn’t it at the end of the day. machines need lots of engineers. So there’s lots of lots of stuff but I guess it was nice being part of a international community while you were there, because you’re you’re meeting people from all over literally all over the world and principally Europe, but you and an all students and staff coming together in the community they created there? It’s so beautiful. There are scientists and engineers from around the world. And the atmosphere is just great. You feel like everybody has the same purpose. And we have something to collaborate for, and something to work on together. It just brings people together from different domains is great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So with that, so when you applied to CERN, what was what was your strategy because I know you have to write sort of a personal statement type thing where you you describe your interests. So were there were there any things that you emphasise Did you particularly tailor what you’d written to particular groups at CERN? Because there’s lots of different groups certain doing software engineering is not just one, did you? Did you tailor it at all? Was it was there anything? Anything that you want, you know, how did you go about applying?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: The thing that I knew was that when you apply there’s not a specific departments to apply to? So you’re applying and then you were sent to a specific group. But yeah, I spent a lot of time in trying to make my application. Having having a personal touch. I was as honest as possible about why I wanted to work at CERN about what you personally I respect what they do. And of course, I try to talk enough and a lot about what makes me a good candidate for them. Yeah, I think we, in general, I think when applying people should put a lot of focus on details. Even if you think that something is not relevant to put the accent on. It can be actually something that makes you stand out. Even at the time, I was not sure how would be accepted even with all these efforts. I was still doubtful. I reminisce it takes quite a long time to do it as well. So every application and in particularly a certain application takes a long time to have to think quite hard about what you’re being asked and what you’re going to say. And yes, you never know if any of this is going to come to anything it can be quite demoralising sometimes filling in all these forms and writing all these personal statements when you never actually know if you’ll get a reply. Yeah, because they asked you not only about what you can do, but more questions to see what kind of person you are. And what do you want to bring into the department we’re working? Yeah, they have to pay a lot of attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you were at CERN for, was it 12 months or were you there for slightly longer did you extend over the summer?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Yes, it was initially one year but then I had the contract extension with three more months when they proposed that to me, I was more than happy to accept it. And of course, I had to confirm it with university. And luckily it was accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you learn any French when you did you? Do you speak any French when you’re out there and or was it mostly in English? That you were speaking?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Mostly in English, but also in French and we have French courses when we went for the first time there so the beginners could choose to have a French course for a couple of months. So I learned a little bit. I cannot say now they know enough to go didn’t want to talk about difficult for me, like switch back to the English system. Like you were living in in France or Geneva in France because it’s close to the border, isn’t it of France. Very close in the border is open so you can just pass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So did you spend any time exploring around Geneva and parts of France that you’re in or did you have any chance to see see see, see the country while you were there?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Were a couple of citizens in Bern, I think from Switzerland, but it’s my favourite city. It’s a small city but it’s very beautiful and I think when somebody has the chance to go to CERN, there are a lot of things to do and to visit. You can just go hiking, if you’re bored because nature is around there. Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you do you ski or snowboard at all? Is that somebody a winter sports person as well?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: there was a ski club at CERN, but I didn’t go this year. But now I will. I will try to go with them. Because at the beginning I was not a very winter sport person. But now I’m going to push myself because it seems very, very fun. Yeah. It can be quite expensive and expensive sport but when you’re living close to the mountains, it’s it becomes a lot more affordable. Because you know it’s only a 30 minute drive away or whatever it is, whereas normally it involves hiring an expensive chalet and you know, and all that stuff, but I think we’re living in a country. It’s sort of it’s it’s a good thing to do. Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, good. So you came back from 15 months, I suppose at CERN into your final year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: So actually, before before I move on to that, actually, so what would you say was the most enjoyable or rewarding part of the placement and you mentioned that you’re part of this international community and learning heaps of stuff. There’s anything that really stands out for you, from what you’ve got from your year from your year at CERN. Yeah, so first, of course, is the whole community that I found there. So I just felt like my place was exactly that. Well, I think one of the most important thing is that I learned how to multitask a lot, how to be able to learn new things, because I think a couple of years ago, I thought that okay, if you if you feel like you can now learn this specific skills, skill, you will never learn it. But in the end itself, there were so many things I had to learn that I didn’t even have time to worry about not being able to find it and yeah, I learned details that I never thought I would understand. Also, not in my area of expertise. For example, details regarding cables, fibre optics, I never I never got in contact with that before. Yeah. And also, it wasn’t my first experience seeing how what you’re doing is actually used and has impact on people. And it gave me this sense of purpose, because I had full responsibility over my tasks. It made me even more excited to do a good job. Those were the most important thing is I enjoyed it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="final-year" class="section level2" number="32.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">32.5</span> Final year</h2>
<p>Good. Okay. So yeah, so we, you came back from your year at CERN, or just over a year at CERN last September and came into your final year. So what were you doing your final year project? Can you tell us a little bit more about what you did for your final year project?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Yes, I was working on a project related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering">neuromorphic computing</a>, which is concentrating or building computer architectures that lay the working in the structure of the human brain and I worked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiNNaker">SpiNNaker</a>, which is the computer built at our university. The idea behind it is to implement spiking neural networks, which are artificial neural networks that have computational elements that mimic real neurons. And my job was to build a new neural models implementing Spinnaker to be able to see if it provides the right behaviour that we were expecting. And I was lucky to be lucky able to live for it and in the end, it was working. And I saw how, how complex and complicated it is to hear even one neuron. How complicated is the field another full network of neurons. And the reason I chose this project is I believe this area of research is very interesting. Being able to simulate the real brain will not only bring progress into computer science, but also neuroscience, for example, just a platform where neuroscientists to analyse the brain and see how it works or how does it do that? Yeah, was a great journey for me this year. Yeah, so that was that’s part of the Human Brain Project Isn’t</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it always amazes me the the, the size and complexity of the human brain is far beyond what we can currently even begin to simulate. I think I forget the figures, but how many how many mice brains is spinnaker now up to how many how many mice can you can simulate the brain for the rat cortex at the moment Right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Yeah, but other than that, I guess it is evolving pretty fast. So who knows? And that’s a lot of that’s a lot of silicon, isn’t it?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How many processors do you have on Spinnaker at the moment? And it cause? I don’t know for sure how many they are to be honest. So the part I think, was it last year or the year before they passed a million core. So a million cores which is which is an insane amount of power. But it can it can you say all that power. You can only simulate a rat Cortex A brain a bit of a rat and use a huge amount of power and your your brain the brain inside your head does that on something like about 40 watts or something? It’s it’s much much lower. It’s amazing, but it’s amazing. It works at all. With all the speed and learning progress of the brain. I think it’s not even fully understood by neuroscientists. So simulating it it’s even harder because it’s not fully understood. Yeah, so your supervisor, your supervisor for that was</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. Good. So so the next thing then is, well, there’s two things really. You’re planning for the future. So I know that sounds actually unusual in that a lot of students who go to CERN aren’t recruited so that they can go back after they have done an a placement. Students go back to their employer after they graduate, but with a lot of CERN students, that’s not the case because they have this educational thing where the money that they’re getting from the European member states, and sort of condition of getting that money is that they educate and train people all over Europe. So it’s not just about recruiting lots of engineers doing a placement there. It’s about spreading the knowledge of all the technology and systems and know how that is it sends spreading that around as widely as possible around Europe. And so in your case, you are you are actually planning to go back I think you might be the first University of Manchester students go back other <a href="https://joshhdawes.github.io/">Josh Dawes</a>, went back there to do a PhD. But there aren’t so many students who go back not because it’s not a nice place to work. It’s just because the way that there’s paper temple students ships are set up as is to encourage people to learn some stuff and then move on to somewhere else. So your plans for the future are to go could to go back to CERN. Is that right? Yeah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca; So luckily for me, I was offered a graduate position in the experimental physics department on our major experiment that they had there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that a different group to what you’re working on before?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Yes, it’s the experimental physics department and it’s on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALICE_experiment">ALICE experiment</a>, which I can talk about if you want. Yeah. So that’ll be another adventure. Then I guess, in terms of stuff that your stuff that you’re going to be learning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you know, do you know too much about the group or what they’re doing it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Yeah, I already know something because I wanted to get into that position. I knew about it. But of course, I was not sure I would be accepted. And I was. It’s called a large iron collider experiment. It’s one of the experiments at CERN where they studied the properties of matter, at extreme densities and temperatures, the collisions of the accelerator, and I will be working on a technology for organised distributed data analysis that is dedicated to storing and accessing the physics data output from ALICE. Yeah, and this is very important for the allosteric output to be able to be accessed by scientists and analysed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Graduate Programme is on is it called a Graduate Programme and do they call it a scholarship or what? It is a fellowship or fellowship? Okay. So how long is the fellowship for is it for a fixed term?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: It’s three years, three years, six months, and then you can extend it. It’s a trial period of six months. And then if you manage to First up, you can extend it up to three, three years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you know what you might do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Um, no, no, three years is obviously a long time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it’s almost as long as you’ve been studying as an undergraduate to do you have any sort of plans after that or any sort of things that you’re thinking of in the future that you might like to do after this period of three years?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: I’m not sure to be honest, I could. Because once you finish that you can also continue at certain with, for example, a sub contract if you want to, and he managed to get it, but I’m thinking that maybe I will find something that I’m very passionate about a specific kind of software technology. And who knows, maybe try to have a master or PhD if I’m not sure the moment or just stay there and work head on carry on being an engineer without doing any further study. So I guess I’m there’s lots of options there for the future.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="rselfie" class="section level2" number="32.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">32.6</span> Advice to your former self</h2>
<p>Sounds good. So I’ve got two two final questions, really. So one is, these interviews are aimed primarily at other students. So what advice would you give to students who are looking for either summer internships or placements during their first and second years of study? What would you what would you advise them to do? What do you think they should be doing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: I think I could talk a lot about that. So yeah, first, I think they should try to find companies or organisations that they identify with what they appreciate. Because this way they will be more dedicated to make a good application. And also if they get accepted, they will be more happy to be happier to work for that specific company or organisation we should try to find companies or organisations that they identify with what they appreciate because this way they will feel more dedicated to make a good application. And also if they get accepted, they will feel more happy. They will be happier to work for that specific company or organisation. Then a lot of effort, a lot of effort has to be put into the application. I know myself because in the second year I realised that a lot of talented students that want the same job, it’s very important to be able to stand out with some personal touch of the application or opening the CV so putting a lot of effort in that is important. And then I think, I think it’s just pretty much it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the point you’re saying about personalization is very important, because I hear stories about how many the volume of applications that the more competitive schemes and CERN’s probably one of the more competitive ones is, you know, it’s hundreds a day of applications. Yeah, you have to remember that there’s a human being on the end of that, who has to somehow try and find that stuff that they’re interested in. And it’s the easiest way one easiest way to do that is to go through ones and just avoid ones that just look like they’re generic applications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: I’m sorry to say that I have a third advice. Do not apply to one company. Right. It’s a very risky. It’s very important to be able to have a backup, or who knows maybe that backup that you have will actually end up being the company you want to work for. You never know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what were your backups? I know, because it sounds obviously quite an attractive employer. Did you have any backups other than certain what there are other places you were thinking? Well, if I can’t get certain then I’ll do this. What other places were you considering at the time?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Yes, yes, I had. I had two others. There was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataStax">DataStax</a> and Koderly right. So I got to know that I could go there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s always tricky balancing quantity of applications with quality because you can either do one or two really, really good high quality applications, but then if they get rejected, then you’re stuck. And the other on the other end of the scale is the sort of scattergun approach where you just apply to lots. If you’re doing lots of applications, then no, I’ve seen students do applications for 50, 60, 70 different internships or placements. And obviously, the more you start doing that, the quality starts going down. So you’ve got to try and balance the quality with the quantity and that’s, that’s not always an easy thing to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: They also have to keep track of the 70 applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may remember what you said, why did why was it I wanted to apply for that company, what is it that they do? And I think that it can also be bewildering as well because I mean, how did you find balancing those commitments with manage managing, you know, managing your second year of study, but then also you need to have a social life as well. And balancing all these commitments can be quite hard sometimes I think.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca Yes, no, it was not easy because second year, it’s busy with more things to do more labs and then you also want to apply for jobs. And you also want to have a social life. Exactly. So I try to organise my making pretty clear to know what am I doing today or tomorrow I, I usually make lists with what I have to do. And take, let’s say, for example, that weekend that’s free or at least one day in the weekend is free. And but I was very passionate and I really really wanted to get a placement. So I dedicated as much time as I could to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it’s good to see that paid off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: yeah, definitely.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="the-future" class="section level2" number="32.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">32.7</span> The future</h2>
<p>Okay, so the other question I had was, so we talked about your plans for the future. So what do you what would you say the most interesting thing or things happening in computer science or technology at the moment there any things that you think this is, this is a growing area? This is something that’s going to be really, really interesting in the future?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca : Yeah, actually. I will answer it in a personal way. neuromorphic computing that I talked about before bit of above unbelievably hard, actually. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so that’s that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there any crossover there? So we’ve talked about physics and the CERN, the Large Hadron Collider and then you’ve talked about neuromorphic computing. And there are two, almost entirely separate fields. Is there any are there any sort of interesting crossovers between the two or any things that you think anything’s you think might you might be able to apply from what you’ve learned in your final year project to to physics</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Yeah, this could be because, as we know, there’s a lot of data generated from the physics experiments at CERN. We have around <strong>1 billion collisions per second.</strong> So we always have to find ways to store and process that data very fast. And very good not have those somewhere. So technologies such as neuromorphic computing, and this kind of architectures could maybe be able in the future to process information faster or better. Of course, now the link is not completely clear for me. I believe there could be some more way of using that knowledge to process the physics data generated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because I know a lot of the computational power of Spinnaker, this neuromorphic computer has yet to be used. So you can build a very powerful computer but then you need people to be able to understand how to operate and then use the resources that that such a machine provides. So yeah, that’s that that sounds that sounds very interesting. Okay, so I think I think I’ve covered all the ground I wanted to, it’s interesting finding out a little bit more about what you’ve been doing what during your time here. It was great to hear about your experiences of CERN, and what you’ve got planned for the future. Is there anything else you’d like to add before we before we close off?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raluca: Nothing, just maybe good luck to the students that are about to be in a placement or find a job?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, thank you for joining us Raluca. Now, I always struggle is I never know with the name. Who could do I emphasise the A or the you where do I put the stress? Is it RalUca? Or is it RAluca? Luca is Raluca right? Okay. Yeah. I, I because we have we have several other students called Raluca. And I always struggle with getting the emphasis rights</p>
<blockquote>
<p>its a difficult name for somebody who’s not Romanian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. I don’t think there’s no there’s not a near equivalent. But thank you, Raluca for joining us,</p>
