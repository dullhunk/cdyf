description: "Welcome to coding your future. This guidebook will teach you how to design, engineer, test and code your future in computing. You'll be introduced to professional issues in computer science, exploring techniques for making career decisions, job searching, submitting applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace. Alongside the practical engineering issues of coding and testing your future, this guidebook also encourages you to design your future by taking a step back and thinking more theoretically. You will apply computational thinking techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people, what your experience is to date and where you want to be in the future.

```
Hello and welcome to *Coding Your Future* ([cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me)) the guidebook that will help you to design, engineer, test and `code` your future in computing. Also published at [cdyf.pdf](https://www.cdyf.me/cdyf.pdf) & [cdyf.epub](https://www.cdyf.me/cdyf.epub), this book is aimed at ALL students in higher education. While the guide supports undergraduate teaching at the University of Manchester, it doesn't actually matter:

* what *stage* of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year
* what *level* you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate
* what *subject* you are studying, as long as you are **computationally curious**
* what *institution* you are studying at, this book is University and institution agnostic
* *where* in the world you are studying

There is something in this guidebook for *any* student of computing, both those inside and outside of Computer Science departments. üë®üèø‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíªüë©üèΩ‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíªüë©üèø‚Äçüíª

## Visualising your future {#picturethis}
A lot of self-help literature can be dry, dull, textbooky, generic and boring with few illustrations and conversations. In the novel *[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)* [@wonderland] shown in figure \@ref(fig:aiw-fig), the protagonist Alice wonders why her sister is reading a book without pictures.


```{r aiw-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionalicecover)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/alicequotation.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionalicecover) Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‚Äúand what is the use of a book,‚Äù thought Alice ‚Äúwithout pictures or conversations? [@wonderland] Public domain image of the cover of the 1898 edition of the novel *[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)* via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3S4C](https://w.wiki/3S4C)

So this book uses pictures and conversations wherever possible to help you understand and visualise your future.

## Your future aims {#vaccine}
This guidebook aims to help you develop stronger habits of mind, body and soul using five key ingredients:

1. **Code:** Instructions contained in this guidebook
1. **Data:** Facts, statistics and images collected together for your analysis
1. **You:** Activities for you to do in addition to reading
1. **Futures:** Possible futures for you to think about. Try not to dwell on the past. Think about the future. Think about *your* future. [@thinkaboutthefuture; @wroteforluck]
1. **Me:** Hello, my name is Duncan. I'm your tour guide here. If you're feeling a bit lost, follow me.


```{r hello-my-name-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "69%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionhellomyname)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Hello-my-name-is-Duncan.png")
```

(ref:captionhellomyname) Hello my name is [Duncan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_(given_name)). If you're feeling a bit lost, follow me. Image adapted from *Hello my name is ... sticker* by Eviatar Bach, public domain [w.wiki/32RV](https://w.wiki/32RV)

Coding your future explores techniques for making career decisions, job searching, submitting applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace.

Alongside these practical engineering issues, this guidebook also encourages you to *design your future* by taking a step back and reflecting on the bigger picture. You will apply [computational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking) techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people and what your experience is. As there is a computational theme, you will also need to reflect on what your inputs and outputs ([I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output)) are, both now and in the future. You'll also need to think about what recipes (or algorithms) you might start experimenting with

This guidebook tackles professional issues in computing, for those with and without Computer Science degrees in the early stage of their careers.

<!--We will also discuss some algorithms (recipes) that you might like to try-->

## What you won't learn {#nilo}
This guidebook will NOT teach you how to write code, there's already lots of fantastic resources to help you do that. We discuss some of them in chapter \@ref(computing) on *computing your future*.

## Learning your future {#bilo}

So what *will* you learn from this guidebook? After reading this guidebook, watching the videos and doing the exercises you will be able to:

1. Improve your self-awareness by describing who you are, what motivates you and your strengths and weaknesses
1. Decide on a job search strategy and identify employers, sectors and roles that are of interest to you		
1. Improve your written communication skills both for job applications and communicating with other people
1. Plan and prepare competitive written applications using standard techniques including CVs, covering letters, application forms and digital profiles
1. Compete successfully in interviews and assessment centres by preparing for technical and non-technical questions
1. Plan further steps in your career such as promotion, postgraduate study & research, alternative employment and longer term goals
1. Search and navigate a large ‚Äúwordbase‚Äù (this guidebook and the work it cites). A wordbase is like a [`codebase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebase), only written predominantly in natural language.

<!--codebase, documentbase, languagebase, wordbase-->

### Your future requirements {#prereq}
As the title of this guidebook implies, there is a computational flavour here, but you do not have to be studying Computer Science to benefit. There are two main target audiences for this guidebook:

1. Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of their degree. This includes software engineering, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction (HCI), information systems, health informatics, data science, gaming, cybersecurity and all the other myriad flavours of Computer Science
1. Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying *any* subject, with little or no Computer Science at all. You are curious to know about what role computing could play in your future career because computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists, see chapter \@ref(computing) on *Computing your Future*

So the prerequisites for this book are that you are studying (or have studied) at University where English is one of the main spoken languages. You *may* have some experience already, either casual, voluntary or otherwise, but this book does **not** assume that you have already been employed in some capacity.

### Gutting your future {#gut}
Don't read this book, gut it! Reading this book from cover to cover like a novel is not recommended. That would be foolish.

```{r gut-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongut)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fish-gutting.jpeg")
```

(ref:captiongut) Don't read this book. [Disembowel it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disembowelment). Eviscerate it. Gut it like a fish. Enjoy the nourishing flesh and discard the less appetising organs of the gastrointestinal tract. You'll need to decide which is which. CC0 Public domain image of fish gutting by Wilfredor via Wikimedia commons [w.wiki/_23m](https://w.wiki/_23m) adapted using the [Wikipedia app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238)

Instead of reading this book, I suggest you follow the advice given to historian [William Woodruff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodruff) about reading books when he was at University:

> ‚ÄúYou don't READ books, you GUT them!‚Äù [@nabend] üêü

So, gut this book like the fish in figure \@ref(fig:gut-fig). Identify the chapters that are most useful to you (the flesh), and skip the rest (the guts). Which chapters are flesh and which are guts will depend on what stage of the journey you are at. This guidebook is designed to be as ‚Äúguttable‚Äù as possible.
To aid gutting, the version published at [cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me/) has a built in search and tables of contents. Before you can gut the fish, you'll need an anatomical map shown in figure \@ref(fig:map-fig).

## Mapping your future {#mapping}
<!-- or should it be structuring-->
This guidebook is split into three parts. The first part (Chapters \@ref(rebooting) to \@ref(computing)) is on design while the second  part (chapters \@ref(debugging) to \@ref(researching)) is on building and testing your future shown in the map in figure \@ref(fig:map-fig). The final part is a help section for supporting your future (chapters \@ref(ruling) to \@ref(reading)). Let's look in a bit more detail at the content of each of the three parts of this guidebook:

```{r map-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmapping)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Course Map.png")
```
(ref:captionmapping) Mapping your future: Each yellow dot on this diagram is a chapter in *Coding Your Future*. The chapters on the left tackle design issues like *who are you*? Chapters on the right tackle the practicalities of executing and testing your career choices, such as *debugging your CV*.

### Designing your future {#parti}

The first six chapters of this guidebook look at what engineers call *design*. When you build anything, a bridge, a piece of software, a car or a plane you'll need to do some design like the blueprint in figure \@ref(fig:brooklyn-fig)

```{r brooklyn-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionblueprint)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/brooklyn-bridge-blueprint.png")
```
(ref:captionblueprint) Designing your future is about drawing up a [blueprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint), like this one for the elevation of the [Brooklyn Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge) in New York. What does your blueprint look like? Chapter's \@ref(rebooting) through to \@ref(computing) will help you design your future.


Building a career isn't that different to building anything else, you'll need to do some design work and it will probably be iterative. Designing things often involves asking tricky questions. So when you're designing your future you'll need to cover the following:

* Chapter \@ref(rebooting): *Rebooting your future* discusses why you should bother reading this guidebook
* Chapter \@ref(knowing): *Knowing your future* challenges you to reflect on who you are, what makes you unique and why you are here
* Chapter \@ref(nurturing): *Nurturing your future* encourages you to take care of your mental and physical health
* Chapter \@ref(writing): *Writing your future* explores your soft skills, and how they complement your hard skills and why employers value them so much
* Chapter \@ref(experiencing): *Experiencing your future* asks you to reflect on your work experience and help identify where you can improve it
* Chapter \@ref(computing): *Computing your future* looks at the role computing can play in your career, especially if Computer Science is not a major part of your degree


### Building your future {#partii}
The next seven chapters look at building (and testing) your future, what engineers like to call *implementation* or *execution* shown in figure \@ref(fig:manhattan-fig).

```{r manhattan-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbridge)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/manhattan_bridge.png")
```
(ref:captionbridge) Just like the [Manhattan Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Bridge), your future will be easier to build once you've done some design. You don't need a grand design with tonnes of details, a simple sketch will do. Design questions are covered in the first part of this guidebook on designing your future. Picture of the Manhattan bridge under construction in 1909 adapted from a public domain image via Wikimedia commons [w.wiki/32Rg](https://w.wiki/32Rg)

Once you've started to answer the design questions in the first part, you can start to implement (or build) your career and think about what the next steps will be.

* Chapter \@ref(debugging): *Debugging your future* looks at debugging your written communication such as covering letters,  application forms and digital portfolios.
* Chapter \@ref(finding): *Finding your future* looks at where and how can you look for interesting opportunities
* Chapter \@ref(broadening): *Broadening your future* encourages you to broaden your horizons. What are the possibilities beyond the obvious?
* Chapter \@ref(speaking): *Speaking your future* looks how can you turn interviews to your advantage and negotiate any offers you receive
* Chapter \@ref(surviving): *Surviving your future* looks at the next steps. Once you've landed a job, how will you survive and thrive outside (and after) University
* Chapter \@ref(achieving): *Achieving your future* looks at evidence you can collect of your learning and development using various kinds of certifiable evidence
* Chapter \@ref(researching): *Researching your future* discusses if a Masters degree or a PhD right for you?

### Supporting your future {#partiii}

The third part of this book, contains supporting material that will help the design, build and test phases described above. You'll need good support to help with the stresses and strains of building your future shown in \@ref(fig:clifton-fig)

```{r clifton-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionclifton)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/clifton.png")
```
(ref:captionclifton) Huge supporting chains on the [Clifton Suspension Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton_Suspension_Bridge) in Bristol allow heavy loads pass over the Avon valley bridge. You'll need good support to cope with the stresses and strains of building your future.

* Chapter \@ref(ruling): *Ruling your future* provides *Ten Simple Rules for Coding your Future*, this book in a nutshell
* Chapter \@ref(hacking): *Hacking your future* invites you to put yourself in the employers shoes by hacking other people's CVs
* Chapter \@ref(moving): *Moving your future* looks at opportunities outside of capital cities like London
* Chapter \@ref(hearing): *Hearing your future* invites you to listen to students stories of their transition from education to employment
* Chapter \@ref(actioning): *Actioning your future* gets you to think about your actions by emphasising verbs on your job applications
* Chapter \@ref(scheduling): *Scheduling your future* is the live synchronous sessions for this course, if you're not participating in these, schedule a time every day or week for personal development
* Chapter \@ref(reading): *Reading your future* lists everything cited in this guidebook.

## Your future themes {#themes}
This guidebook aims to help you build a bridge from where you are now to where you'd like to be in the future. Each chapter of the book contains the following recurring themes:

```{r goldengate-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongoldengate)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/goldengate.png")
```

<!--in progress 1. **Puzzlers** are deliberately open-ended questions. There are no right or wrong answers to many of these questions, and some of them non-trivial to respond to. While you might be able to answer some questions relatively quickly, others may require more extensive research, reflection and discussion.-->


## Contributing to your future {#contributing}
If you'd like to contribute this guidebook, I welcome constructive feedback from [critical friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_friend), see figure \@ref(fig:critical-friend-fig).


```{r critical-friend-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captioncriticalfriend)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/critical-friend.jpeg")
```

(ref:captioncriticalfriend) Can you be a supportive but [critical friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_friend) of this guidebook? Public domain image of a painting *Friendship* by [Petrona Viera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrona_Viera) via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3WjY](https://w.wiki/3WjY) adapted using the [Wikipedia App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238)


 I'm looking for feedback and contributions on everything in this guidebook from the small things like typos, grammatical errors and spelling mistakes through to bigger issues for each chapter such as:

* Does the chapter make sense, is it clear?
* Does it strike the right tone, is it pitched at the right level? Not patronising? Too many platitudes?
* Are there too many motivational (or [demotivational](https://despair.com/collections/demotivators)) quotations?
* Where is it too long and waffly (see figure \@ref(fig:shorterletter-fig)) or too short?
* Are there too many (or too few) pictures? What needs more illustration?
* Is it well scoped? Too broad or too narrow?
* Are the stated learning objectives met by the chapter?
* Are the activities clear? Can students understand why the activities are recommended? What other activities could be added?
* Will it make sense to global readers e.g. will students from China and India understand the quirks and idioms of English language and culture
* Are there too many metaphors? Mixed metaphors? Confusing analogies?
* Too many citations? Not enough citations? Missed any key citations?
* What's missing?
* Where are the unstated assumptions? Where is the unconscious bias?
* What are the issues with equality, diversity and inclusion?
* Are there too many musical references or annoying emoji? Please bear in mind I'm trying to strike an irreverent, light-hearted and playful tone to improve readability üòú
* What else should be ruthlessly edited out?

All suggestions welcome! Don't be shy. There are several ways you can contribute, depending on how comfortable you are with Git:

### For git contributors {#techies}

If you're familiar with git and markdown you can [github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and:

* Raise new issues at [github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/new](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/new)
* Click on the `Edit this page` link, which appears on the bottom right hand side of every page published at [cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me) when viewed with a reasonably large screen (not a phone)
* Contribute at [github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/contribute](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/contribute) and help with existing issues at [github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues)
* Fork the repository, make changes and submit a pull request [github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/pulls](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/pulls). If you need to brush-up on your pulling skills see [makeapullrequest.com](http://makeapullrequest.com/)
* From the command line type `git clone https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf.git` the repository and submit pull requests from your own setup

Most of the guidebook is generated from [RMarkdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), that's [all the `*.Rmd` files](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/search?l=RMarkdown). So markdown files are the only ones you should need to edit because everything else is generated from them including the `*.html`, `*.tex`, `*.pdf`,`*.epub` and `*.docx`  files.

### For everyone else {#elseif}

If you don't want to (or can't) use Git and [github.com](https://github.com/) then you can:

* Add comments by annotating [cdyf.pdf](https://www.cdyf.me/cdyf.pdf) using your personal weapon of choice (tablet, [reMarkable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReMarkable) or whatever) and [emailing your updated version to me](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/contact.html)
* Add comments by annotating [cdyf.epub](https://www.cdyf.me/cdyf.epub) and [emailing your updated version to me](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/contact.html)
* Suggest changes by editing the  Microsoft Word version at [cdyf.docx](http://cdyf.me/cdyf.docx). The text is all there, but the images are all over the place. This is because the pagination, typesetting and graphic placement algorithms in Word aren't anything like as good as the LaTeX ones used to create [cdyf.pdf](https://www.cdyf.me/cdyf.pdf) from [cdyf.tex](https://cdyf.me/cdyf.tex).^[Don't say I didn't warn you!] Make sure you've [turned on track changes in Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/track-changes-in-word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a) so that your corrections are easily identified.
* Just [email me suggestions for improvements](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/contact.html)

Any corrections or suggestions will be gratefully received and noted in the acknowledgements section \@ref(thanks), unless you tell me otherwise. I welcome all improvements, big and small.

## Acknowledgements {#thanks}
The content of this book is based on hundreds of conversations I have had with students of (mainly) Computer Science and Maths with some Physics and Engineering, since 2012. It is also based on conversations I've had with many of their employers too.

### Thank you students {#students}
First and foremost, I'd like to thank all the students who have helped with this book, both directly and indirectly see figure \@ref(fig:giants-fig).

```{r giants-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongiants)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/standing-on-the-shoulders-of-students.png")
```
(ref:captiongiants) If I have seen further it is by [standing on the shoulders of ~~giants~~ students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants).

So, if you have studied some flavour of Computer Science at the University of Manchester since 2012, there's a high probability you have contributed to this book. Thank you for having the courage to tell me your stories. Thank you for being ambitious, hard working, talented, fearless, creative, inspirational and listening to me (sometimes). It has been my pleasure and privilege to work with you all.


I'd especially like to thank industrial experience (IE) students who have completed a year in industry as part of their degree as well as those who have done summer internships, either as part of the Master of Engineering (MEng) program or otherwise, particularly [Sami Alabed](https://github.com/samialabed), Luke Beamish and Petia Davidova. In addition, the [PASS leaders](http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk) and facilitators, [UniCSmcr.com](https://unicsmcr.com/), [HackSoc](https://github.com/unicsmcr/hacksoc.com), [CSSoc](https://github.com/cssoc) and [Manchester Ultimate Programming](https://github.com/Man-UP) members have all been influential on the content of this book. I've learned heaps by manually trawling through thousands of your CVs too, so if you've shown me a copy of your CV, thanks! If you sent me a CV and I didn't reply, I apologise. There are limits to what is humanly possible. Chapter \@ref(debugging) on *Debugging your future* (self assessment) and chapter \@ref(hacking) on *Hacking your future* (peer assessment) are based on the most common bugs (or are they features?) I've seen in CVs.

So, thank you students for being studious. üôè

### Thank you employers {#employers}

Thanks to all the organisations who have employed students from the Department of Computer Science as either summer interns, year long placements or graduates. A big chunk of this guidebook documents their experience of employers and their graduate recruitment programs.

Thanks to Niall Beard and [Sharif Salah](https://github.com/sharifsalah) at Google for introducing me to Google's Technical Writing course. [@googling]

So, thanks employers for employing our students. üôè

### Thank you colleagues {#colleagues}
I've also had significant support from colleagues in the Department of Computer Science  ([\@csmcr](https://twitter.com/csmcr)) and support staff at the University of Manchester. ([\@ManUniCareers](https://twitter.com/ManUniCareers), [\@alumniUoM](https://twitter.com/alumniUoM), [\@OfficialUoM](https://twitter.com/OfficialUoM))

I would especially like to thank [Jim Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_John_Miles) for encouraging me to write a book shortly after he offered me a job. I thought he was joking (about the book) but it actually turned out to be another one of Jim's great ideas. Thanks Jim. üôè

I'd also like to thank the only three people in the whole world who've had the misfortune of reading all of my PhD thesis; [Robert Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_David_Stevens), [Anil Wipat](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/anilwipat.html) and [Steve Pettifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Pettifer). I suspect it was as painful for you to read as it was for me to write it. Thanks Robert for your relentless patience and giving me a well timed, well aimed kick up the arse (to write this book and course) in the [Midland Hotel, Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Hotel,_Manchester) at the May ball. ‚öΩÔ∏è

Thanks [Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber) for playing bass in our ‚Äúboy band‚Äù [Tuning Complete](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/research.html#tuningcomplete). Thanks to [Carole Goble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Goble) for patiently re-teaching me how to write by covering early drafts of my MSc thesis in red ink and less patiently (on subsequent revisions) swear words. ü§¨

(ref:captionstannes) Good governance is crucial to good schools. Many forgotten schools like St. Anne's, and the thousands of children in the UK they educate every year, need help from skilled people like you on their governing boards. Why not serve your local community as a ‚Äú[critical friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_friend)‚Äù on the governing board of a school? All ages are welcome, but especially younger governors, see [where are all the young school governors?](https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/mar/11/young-people-school-governors) [@youngovernors] Take a look at [governorsforschools.org.uk](https://governorsforschools.org.uk/).

Thanks to all the schools who interviewed (but rejected me) for my [Newly Qualified Teacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newly_qualified_teacher) (NQT) year. Doing interview lessons, meeting your students and your senior leadership teams was a gruelling but fascinating magical mystery tour of the UK education system, both public and private. Although unsuccessful, these interviews were very productive failures:

Bryan is an artist, visual thinker and entrepreneur, who also happens to have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Glasgow. His combined skills in art, science and engineering made him the perfect fit for illustrating this guidebook. You can find out more about Bryan at [bryanmathers.com](https://bryanmmathers.com) and [visualthinkery.com](https://visualthinkery.com). I'm *sooo* glad we randomly bumped into each other at a conference shown in figure \@ref(fig:bumped-fig).

So, thanks Bryan for your witty illustrations, this book wouldn't be the same without your visual thinkery.  üôè

### Thank you friends {#friends}

## About me {#duncan}
Hello, my name is [Duncan Hull](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/) and I wrote this guidebook for undergraduate and postgraduate students as part of my job at the University of Manchester where I'm a lecturer (‚âà [Assistant Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_professor)) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/).

So what's *my* story? Like many people, my path has been what [Helen Tupper](https://twitter.com/HelenTupper) and Sarah Ellis call a ‚Äú[squiggly career](https://www.amazingif.com/)‚Äù rather than classic linear one. [@squigglybook; @squigglytalk] I've been gainfully employed as a paperboy, supermarket cashier, shelf stacker, sausage factory worker, pork pie filler, chef, dogsbody, field assistant, database administrator, deli counter server, consultant, matchday steward, envelope stuffer, high school teacher, postdoc, research scientist, software engineer, lecturer, external examiner, tutor and scholar.

I've done a range of voluntary work too, serving as a competition judge, fundraiser, [code club](https://codeclub.org) \& [coderdojo](https://coderdojo.com) leader, rabble rouser, [digital council](https://www.manchesterdigital.com/) member, [school governor](https://governorsforschools.org.uk/), curator, librarian, beer drinker, [wikipedia trainer](https://wiki-loves-scientists.org.uk/), [journal clubber](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) and editor. But as Ronnie Lane and Ronnie Wood (figure \@ref(fig:faces-fig)) once said:

```{r faces-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "99%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionfaces)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/faces.jpeg")
```
(ref:captionfaces) Hindsight is a great teacher. I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger, see [Ooh La La](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_La_La_(Faces_song)) [@faces] I've written some of what I know now in this guidebook, I hope you find it useful.

This guidebook documents some of what I know now, that I wish I'd known, when I was younger. If you're starting your career, I hope you find these insights useful. I've sat on both sides of the interview table, as interviewer and interviewee. I have had some spectacular failures, alongside some modest successes, and have included personal stories where they are relevant.

Most of what I have learned about employment comes from listening to, and watching students interact with employers as they take the first tentative steps in their careers. I've documented some of what they taught me, so reading this book may help you learn from some of their successes and failures.

## Legal stuff {#legal}

I am not a lawyer ([IANAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL)) but any opinions expressed in this guidebook are my own and not representative of my current employer, the University of Manchester. This guidebook does not therefore, represent University policy.
