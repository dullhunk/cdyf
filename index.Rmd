```
Hello and welcome to Coding Your Future, the guidebook that will help you to design, build, test, debug and code your future in computing. This guidebook is aimed at students in higher education, both those studying Computer Science as part of their degree or those from other disciplines with an interest in computing.

This guidebook supports second year teaching at the University of Manchester, but it DOES NOT MATTER:

* what *stage* of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year
* what *level* you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate
* what *subject* you are studying, provided that you are computationally curious
* what *institution* you are studying at, this book is University and institution agnostic
* *where* in the world you are studying

So there is probably something in this guidebook for every student of computing around the world. üåéüåçüåè

## Visualising your future in wonderland {#picturethis}
A lot of literature about what comes after University can be dry, dull, textbook-y and boring with few illustrations and conversations.

```{r aiw-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "32%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionalicecover)"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Alicesadventuresinwonderland1898.jpg", 3))
```
(ref:captionalicecover) The cover of the 1898 edition of the novel *[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)*. Public domain image via Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/327E](https://w.wiki/327E)


In the novel *[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)* [@wonderland], the heroine Alice wonders what books are for if they don't have pictures and conversations:

> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‚Äúand what is the use of a book,‚Äù thought Alice ‚Äúwithout pictures or conversations?‚Äù -- See [gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-h/11-h.htm#chap01) [@wonderland]

So this book uses pictures and conversations wherever possible to help you understand and  visualise your future.

## Aiming your future {#vaccine}
To envisage your future you may need to develop healthier habits of mind, body and soul using five key ingredients:

1. **Code:** Instructions contained in this guidebook
1. **Data:** Facts, statistics and images collected together for your analysis
1. **You:** Activities for you to do in addition to reading
1. **Futures:** Possible futures for you to think about. Think about the future. [@thinkaboutthefuture] Try not to dwell on the past
1. **Me:** Hello, my name is Duncan. I'm your tour guide here. If you're feeling a bit lost, follow me.


```{r hello-my-name-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "69%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionhellomyname)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Hello-my-name-is-Duncan.png")
```

(ref:captionhellomyname) Hello my name is Duncan. If you're feeling a bit lost, follow me. Image adapted from "Hello my name is sticker" by Eviatar Bach, public domain [w.wiki/32RV](https://w.wiki/32RV)

Coding your future explores techniques for making career decisions, job searching, submitting applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace.

Alongside these practical engineering issues, this guidebook also encourages you to *design your future* by taking a step back and reflecting on the bigger picture. You will apply [computational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking) techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people and what your experience is. As there is a computational theme, you will also need to reflect on what your inputs and outputs ([I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output)) are, both now and in the future. You'll also need to think about what recipes (or algorithms) you might start experimenting with

This guidebook tackles professional issues in computing, for those with and without Computer Science degrees in the early stage of their careers.

<!--We will also discuss some algorithms (recipes) that you might like to try-->

## What you won't learn {#nilo}

This book will NOT teach you how to write code, there's already lots of fantastic resources to help you do that. We discuss some of them in chapter on [computing your future](#computing).

## What you will learn {#bilo}

After reading this guidebook, watching the videos and doing the exercises you will be able to:

1. Improve your self-awareness by describing who you are, what motivates you and your strengths and weaknesses
1. Decide on a job search strategy and identify employers, sectors and roles that are of interest to you		
1. Improve your written communication skills both for job applications and collaborating with other people
1. Plan and prepare competitive written applications using standard techniques including CVs, covering letters, application forms and digital profiles
1. Compete successfully in interviews and assessment centres by preparing for technical and non-technical questions
1. Plan further steps in your career such as promotion, postgraduate study & research, alternative employment and longer term goals
1. Search and navigate a large ‚Äúwordbase‚Äù (this book). A wordbase is like a codebase, only written mostly in natural language.

<!--codebase, documentbase, languagebase, wordbase-->

### Prerequisites {#prereq}
As the title of this guidebook implies, there is a computational flavour here, but you do not have to be studying Computer Science to benefit. There are two main target audiences for this guidebook:

1. Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of their degree. This includes software engineering, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction (HCI), information systems, health informatics, data science, gaming, cybersecurity and all the other myriad flavours of Computer Science
1. Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying *any* subject, with little or no Computer Science at all. You are curious to know about what role computing could play in your future career because computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists.

So the prerequisites for this book are that you are studying (or have studied) at University where English is one of the main spoken languages. You *may* have some experience already, either casual, voluntary or otherwise, but this book does **not** assume that you have already been employed in some capacity.

### Don't read this book, gut it! {#gut}
I don't recommend you read this book from cover to cover in one sitting. That would be foolish.

```{r gut-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongut)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fish-gutting.png")
```

(ref:captiongut) Don't read this book, gut it like a fish. Gutting fish in Isla Margarita image by Wilfredor via Wikimedia commons [w.wiki/_23m](https://w.wiki/_23m)

Instead of reading this book, I suggest you follow the advice given to historian [William Woodruff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodruff) about reading books when he was at University:

> ‚ÄúYou don't READ books, you GUT them!‚Äù [@nabend] üêü

So, gut this book like a fish. Identify the chapters that are most useful to you (the flesh), and skip the rest (the guts). Which chapters are flesh and which are guts will depend on what stage of the journey you are at. This guidebook is designed to be as ‚Äúguttable‚Äù as possible.
To aid gutting, the version published at [cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me/) has a built in search and tables of contents. Before you can gut the fish, you'll need an anatomical map shown in figure \@ref(fig:map-fig).

## Mapping your future {#mapping}
<!-- or should it be structuring-->
This guidebook is split into three parts. The first part is on [designing your future](bothering.html) while the second is on [building and testing your future](debugging.html) shown in the map in figure \@ref(fig:map-fig). The final part is a [help](ruling.html) section, for rebooting your future. Let's look in a bit more detail at the content of each of the three parts of this guidebook:

```{r map-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmapping)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Course Map.png")
```
(ref:captionmapping) Mapping your future: Each yellow dot on this diagram is a chapter in *Coding Your Future*. The chapters on the left tackle design issues like *who are you*? Chapters on the right tackle the practicalities of executing and testing your career choices, such as *debugging your CV*.

### Designing your future {#parti}

The first six chapters of this guidebook look at what engineers call *design*. When you build anything, a bridge, a piece of software, a car or a plane you'll need to do some design like the blueprint in figure \@ref(fig:brooklyn-fig)

```{r brooklyn-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionblueprint)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/brooklyn-bridge-blueprint.png")
```
(ref:captionblueprint) Designing your future is about drawing up a [blueprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint), like this one for the elevation of the [Brooklyn Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge) in New York. What does your blueprint look like? The chapters on [designing your future](bothering.html) will help you fill in the details.


Building a career isn't that different to building anything else, you'll need to do some design work and it will probably be iterative. Designing things often involves asking tricky questions. So when you're designing your future you'll need to cover the following:

* [Bothering with your future](bothering.html) looks at why you should bother reading any of this book
* [Knowing your future](knowing.html) challenges you to reflect on who you are, what makes you unique and why you are here
* [Looking after your future](wellbeing.html) encourages you to take care of your mental and physical health
* [Writing your future](communicating.html) explores your soft skills, and how they complement your hard skills and why employers value them so much
* [Experiencing your future](experiencing.html) asks you to reflect on your work experience and help identify where you can improve it
* [Computing your future](computing.html) looks at the role computing can play in your career, with or without a Computer Science degree


### Building and testing your future {#partii}
The next six chapters look at building and testing your future, what engineers like to call *implementation*, *execution* or *construction* shown in figure \@ref(fig:manhattan-fig)

```{r manhattan-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbridge)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/manhattan_bridge.png")
```
(ref:captionbridge) Just like the [Manhattan Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Bridge), your future will be easier to build once you've started to answer some fundamental design questions which are covered in the first part of this guidebook on [designing your future](bothering.html). Manhattan bridge under construction in 1909 picture adapted from public domain image via Wikimedia commons [w.wiki/32Rg](https://w.wiki/32Rg)

Once you've started to answer the design questions in the first part, you can start to implement (or build) your career and think about what the next steps will be.

* [Debugging your future](debugging.html) looks at debugging your written communication such as covering letters,  application forms and digital portfolios.
* [Finding your future](finding.html), looks at where and how can you look for interesting opportunities
* [Speaking your future](interviewing.html), looks how can you turn interviews to your advantage and negotiate any offers you receive
* [Surviving your future](surviving.html) looks at the next steps. Once you've landed a job, how will you survive and thrive outside (and after) University
* [Researching your future](studying.html) discusses if a Masters degree or a PhD right for you?
* [Broadening your future](broadening.html) encourages you to broaden your horizons. Maybe you want to start your own business and employ others or you'd like to work in the non-profit or public sector? Perhaps you could be a freelancer or contractor? The possibilities are endless.

### Supporting your future {#partiii}

The third part of this book, contains supporting material that will help the design, build and test phases described above. You'll need good support to help with the stresses and strains of building your future shown in \@ref(fig:clifton-fig)

```{r clifton-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionclifton)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/clifton.png")
```

* [Ruling your future](ruling.html) provides *Ten Simple Rules for Coding your Future*, this book in a nutshell
* [Reading their future](sampling.html) invites you to put yourself in the employers shoes by reading some CVs
* [Moving your future](notjustlondon.html) looks at opportunities outside of capital cities like London
* [Listening to your future](listening.html) invites you to hear students stories of their transition from education to employment
* [Actioning your future](verbsfirst.html) gets you to think about your actions by emphasising verbs on your job applications
* [Scheduling your future](scheduling.html) invites you to set aside an hour each week for tackling the issues described in this book
* [Reading your future](references.html) everything we've cited in this guidebook, because books are good for your soul

<!--1. **References** - Further reading, absolutely everything we've cited, not just the essential signposts-->
<!--in progress 1. **Quick quizzes** quick quizzes to test your knowledge-->
<!--in progress 1. **Puzzlers** are deliberately open-ended questions. There are no right or wrong answers to many of these questions, and some of them non-trivial to respond to. While you might be able to answer some questions relatively quickly, others may require more extensive research, reflection and discussion.-->

## Acknowledgements {#thanks}
The content of this book is based on hundreds of conversations I have had with students of (mainly) Computer Science and Maths with some Physics and Engineering, since 2012. I've also spoken to many of their employers too.

### Standing on the shoulders of students {#students}
First and foremost, I'd like to thank all the students who have helped with this book, both directly and indirectly.

> ‚ÄúIf I have seen further it is by [standing on the shoulders of students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants).‚Äù [@newton]

So, if you have studied some flavour of Computer Science at the University of Manchester since 2012, there's a high probability you have contributed to this book. Thank you for having the courage to tell me your stories. Thank you for being ambitious, hard working, talented, fearless, creative, inspirational and listening to me. It has been my pleasure and privilege to work with you all.

I'd especially like to thank industrial experience (IE) students who have completed a year in industry as part of their degree as well as those who have done summer internships, either as part of the Master of Engineering (MEng) program or otherwise. In addition, the [PASS leaders](http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk) and facilitators, [UniCSmcr.com](https://unicsmcr.com/), [HackSoc](https://github.com/unicsmcr/hacksoc.com),  [CSSoc](https://github.com/cssoc) and [Manchester Ultimate Programming](https://github.com/Man-UP) members have all been influential on the content of this book. I've learned heaps by manually trawling through thousands of your CVs too, so if you've shown me a copy of your CV, thanks! If you sent me a CV and I didn't reply, I apologise. There are limits to what is humanly possible. The chapters on [debugging your future](debugging.html) (self assessment) and [reading their future](sampling.html) (peer assessment) are based on the most common bugs (or are they features?) I've seen in CVs.

    desc = ifelse(is.na(fullname), link, glue::glue("{fullname} ({link})"))
  )
cat(paste0(contributors$desc, collapse = ", "))
```
-->

So, thank you students for being studious. üôè

### Thanks to employers {#employers}

Thanks to all the organisations who have employed students from the Department of Computer Science as either summer interns, year long placements or graduates. A big chunk of this guidebook documents their experience of employers and their graduate recruitment programs.

```
-->

Thanks to Niall Beard and [Sharif Salah](https://github.com/sharifsalah) at Google for introducing me to Google's Technical Writing course. [@googling]

So, thanks employers for employing our students. üôè

### Thanks to colleagues {#colleagues}
I've also had significant support from academic colleagues in the Department of Computer Science  ([\@csmcr](https://twitter.com/csmcr)) and support staff at the University of Manchester. ([\@ManUniCareers](https://twitter.com/ManUniCareers), [\@alumniUoM](https://twitter.com/alumniUoM), [\@OfficialUoM](https://twitter.com/OfficialUoM))

I would especially like to thank [Jim Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_John_Miles) for encouraging me to write a book shortly after he offered me a job. I thought he was joking (about the book) but it actually turned out to be another one of Jim's great ideas. Thanks Jim. üôè

I'd also like to thank the only three people in the whole world who've had the misfortune of reading all of my PhD thesis; [Robert Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_David_Stevens), [Anil Wipat](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/anilwipat.html) and [Steve Pettifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Pettifer). I suspect it was as painful for you to read as it was for me to write it. Thanks Robert for your relentless patience and giving me a well timed, well aimed kick up the arse in the [Midland Hotel, Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Hotel,_Manchester) at the May ball. ‚öΩÔ∏è

Optimists will tell you that ‚Äúeveryone has a book in them...‚Äù, but pessimists like [Christoph Hitchens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens) will add that ‚Äú...in most cases that's where it should remain‚Äù. [@everyone]

Despite Hitchens amusing trademark cynicism shown in figure \@ref(fig:hitchens-fig), I am an optimist when it comes to the power of natural languages.

### Thank you schools {#nothanks}
Thanks to all the schools who interviewed (but rejected me) for my [Newly Qualified Teacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newly_qualified_teacher) (NQT) year. Doing interview lessons, meeting your students and your senior leadership teams was a gruelling but fascinating magical mystery tour of the UK education system:

* [Wrightlington School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writhlington_School), Radstock, Somerset, see their amazing Orchid project [wsbeorchids.org](https://wsbeorchids.org/thirty-years-of-the-writhlington-schools-orchid-project-a-teachers-view-by-simon-pugh-jones/) run by [Simon Pugh-Jones](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-degrees/honorary-graduates-2019/simon-pugh-jones/)
* The [Cooper School, Bicester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_School,_Bicester), Oxon see their [Teacher in my pocket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdywHl2ZA-I)
* [St John's Marlborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_Marlborough), Wiltshire - not to be confused its famous next door neighbour [Marlborough College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlborough_College)
* [Oasis Academy, Brislington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis_Academy_Brislington), Bristol
* [Redland Green School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redland_Green_School), Bristol
* [The John of Gaunt School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_John_of_Gaunt_School), Trowbridge, Wiltshire
* [Didcot Girls School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didcot_Girls%27_School), Oxon
* [Cheltenham Ladies' College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheltenham_Ladies%27_College), Gloucestershire^[As a newly qualified Jedi knight, freshly armed with a PGCE, I was anxious for my first teaching job and momentarily considered using my powers on the ‚Äúdark side‚Äù (a.k.a. private education). [@nicebutdim] Forgive me for I have sinned!]
* [Blackburn College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_College_(Blackburn_with_Darwen)), Lancashire  ‚ÄúI heard the news today, oh boy! Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire‚Äù [@adayinthelife]

So thanks schools, for schooling. üôè

### Thank you Stockport {#stockport}

Thanks to headteacher Joanne Meredith,<!--https://web.archive.org/web/20131202172038/http://www.st-annes.stockport.sch.uk/about-us/meet-the-head--> her team of staff and the students at [St. Annes R.C. High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Anne%27s_RC_Voluntary_Academy), Stockport for hosting my [Newly Qualified Teacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newly_qualified_teacher) (NQT) year. Thanks to Keith Doran and other members of the *alternative staff room* for your emotional, moral and practical support throughout the year. The *Manchester Evening News* has dubbed St. Anne's ‚Äúthe forgotten school‚Äù [@stannes1; @stannes2], see figure \@ref(fig:st-annes-fig), but I'll never forget you or the lessons you taught me.

```{r st-annes-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionstannes)"}

```

(ref:captionstannes) Good governance is crucial to good schools. Many schools like St. Annes, and the hundreds of children they educate every year, need help from skilled people like you. Why not serve your local community as a school governor? Take a look at [governorsforschools.org.uk](https://governorsforschools.org.uk/).

So thanks Stockport for being Stockport, and for [The Hatters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockport_County_F.C.)! It's all that matters. üôè

### Thank you Bryan {#visualthinkery}

Bryan is an artist, visual thinker and entrepreneur, who also happens to have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Glasgow. His combined skills in art, science and engineering made him the perfect fit for illustrating this guidebook. You can find out more about Bryan at [bryanmathers.com](https://bryanmmathers.com) and [visualthinkery.com](https://visualthinkery.com). I'm *sooo* glad we randomly bumped into each other at a conference shown in figure \@ref(fig:bumped-fig).

So, thanks Bryan for your witty illustrations, this book wouldn't be the same without your visual thinkery.  üôè

### Thanks to my friends {#friends}

## About me {#duncan}
Hello, my name is [Duncan Hull](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/) and I wrote this guidebook for students at the University of Manchester where I'm a lecturer (‚âà [Assistant Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_professor)) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/).

So what's *my* story? Like many people, my path has been what [Helen Tupper](https://twitter.com/HelenTupper) and Sarah Ellis call a ‚Äúsquiggly career‚Äù rather than classic linear one. [@squiggly] I've been gainfully employed as a paperboy, supermarket cashier, shelf stacker, sausage factory worker, pork pie filler, chef, dogsbody, field assistant, database administrator, deli counter server, consultant, matchday steward, envelope stuffer, juror, high school teacher, postdoc, research scientist, software engineer, lecturer, external examiner, tutor and academic.

I've done a range of voluntary work too, serving as a competition judge, fundraiser, rabble rouser, [code club](https://codeclub.org) \& [coderdojo](https://coderdojo.com) leader, [digital council](https://www.manchesterdigital.com/) member, [school governor](https://governorsforschools.org.uk/), curator, librarian, beer drinker, [wikipedia trainer](https://wiki-loves-scientists.org.uk/), [journal clubber](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) and editor. But as Ronnie Lane and Ronnie Wood once said:

> ‚ÄúI wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger.‚Äù ---Ronnie Lane [@faces]

This guidebook documents some of what I know now, that I wish I'd known, when I was younger. If you're starting your career, I hope you find these insights useful. I've sat on both sides of the interview table, as interviewer and interviewee. I have had some spectacular failures, alongside some modest successes, and have included personal stories where they are relevant.

Most of what I have learned about employment comes from listening to, and watching students interact with employers as they take the first tentative steps in their careers. I've documented some of what they taught me, so reading this book may help you learn from some of their successes and failures.

## Legal stuff {#legal}
