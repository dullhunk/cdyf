Welcome to Coding Your Future, the guidebook that will help you to design, build, test, debug and code your future in computing. This guidebook is aimed at students in higher education, both those studying Computer Science as part of their degree or those from other disciplines with an interest in computing.

The content happens to support second year teaching at the University of Manchester, it doesn't matter what stage of your undergraduate or postgraduate study you are, what you're studying or where you are studying it. There's something here for everybody.

<!--todo check github-repo-->

## Aims of this guidebook

This explores techniques for making career decisions, job searching, submitting applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace.

Alongside the practical engineering issues of *coding your future*, this book also encourages you to *design your future* by reflecting on the bigger picture. You will apply computational thinking techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people and what your experience is to date. As there is a computational theme, you'll also need to reflect on what your inputs and outputs ([I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output)) are, both now and in the future. You'll also need the think about what recipes (or algorithms) you might start experimenting with.

So this guidebook tackles professional issues in computing, for those with and without Computer Science degrees in the early stage of their careers.

<!--We will also discuss some algorithms (recipes) that you might like to try-->

## What you will (and won't) learn {#bilo}

After reading this guidebook, watching the videos and doing the exercises you will be able to:

1. Improve your self-awareness by describing who you are, what motivates you and your strengths and weaknesses
1. Decide on a job search strategy and identify employers, sectors and roles that are of interest to you		
1. Improve your written communication skills both for job applications and collaborating with other people
1. Plan and prepare competitive written applications using standard techniques including CVs, covering letters, application forms and digital profiles.	 	
1. Compete successfully in interviews and assessment centres by preparing for technical and non-technical questions
1. Plan further steps in your career such as promotion, postgraduate study & research, alternative employment and longer term goals.

This book will NOT teach you how to write code, there's already lots of fantastic resources to help you do that. We discuss some of them in chapter six [Computing Your Future](#computing).

### Prerequisites {#prereq}
As the title of this guidebook implies, there is a computational flavour here, but you do not have to be studying Computer Science to benefit from reading it. There are two main target audiences for this guidebook:

1. Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of their degree. This includes software engineering, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction (HCI), information systems, health informatics, data science, gaming, cybersecurity and all the other myriad flavours of Computer Science
1. Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying *any* subject, with little or no Computer Science at all. You are curious to know about what role computing could play in your future career. Computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists.

So the prerequisites for this book are that you are studying (or have studied) at University, most likely the United Kingdom. You *may* have some experience already, either casual, voluntary or otherwise, but this book does **not** assume that you have already been employed in some capacity.

### Don't read this, gut it! {#gut}
I don't recommend you read this book from cover to cover in one sitting. Instead, I suggest you follow the advice given to historian [William Woodruff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodruff) about reading books when he was at University:

> ‚ÄúYou don't READ books, you GUT them!‚Äù [@nabend] üêü

So gut this book like a fish. Identify the chapters that are most useful to you (the flesh), and skip the rest (the guts). Which chapters are flesh and which are guts will depend on what stage of the journey you are at. This guidebook is designed to be as ‚Äúguttable‚Äù as possible.
To aid gutting, the web based form at published at [www.cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me/) has a built in search.

This guidebook is split into three parts, the first part is on [designing your future](bothering.html) while the second is on [building and testing your future](debugging.html) which are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:map-fig). The final part is a [help](ruling.html) section, supporting your future.

## Structuring your future {#structure}

Let's look in a bit more detail at the content of each part of this guidebook:


### PART I: Designing your future {#parti}

The first part of this guidebook (chapters 1 to 6) looks at what engineers call *design*. When you build anything, a bridge, a piece of software, a car or a plane you'll need to do some design. Building a career isn't that different to building anything else, you'll need to do some design work and it will probably be iterative. Designing things often involves asking tricky questions. So when you're designing your future you'll need to cover the following:

* The first chapter [why bother?](bothering.html) looks at why you should bother reading any of this book
* The second chapter [who are you?](knowing.html) challenges you to reflect on who you are, what makes you unique and why you are here
* The third chapter looks at [your well-being](wellbeing.html), taking care of your mental and physical health
* The fourth chapter [soft skills are hard](communicating.html) explores your soft skills, how they complement your hard skills and why employers value them so much
* The fifth chapter [are you experienced?](experiencing.html) asks you to reflect on your work experience and help identify where you can improve it
* The sixth chapter [computing your future](computing.html) looks at the role computing can play in your career, with or without a Computer Science degree


### PART II: Building and testing your future {#partii}
The next six chapters look at building and testing your future, what engineers like to call *implementation* or *execution*. Once you've started to answer the design questions in the first part, you can start to implement (or build) your career and think about what the next steps will be.

* The seventh chapter helps you to [debug your CV](debugging.html) alongside other written communication such as covering letters,  application forms and digital portfolios.
* The eighth chapter looks at [your job search and networks](finding.html), where can you look for interesting opportunities
* The ninth chapter looks [your interviews and offers](interviewing.html), how can you turn interviews to your advantage and negotiate any offers you receive
* The tenth chapter looks at [your survival and promotion](surviving.html), once you've landed a job, how will you survive and thrive outside (and after) University
* The eleventh chapter looks at [postgraduate study](studying.html) is a Masters degree or a PhD right for you?
* The twelfth chapter looks at [your alternatives](broadening.html) and encourages you to broaden your horizons. Perhaps you could be a freelancer, contractor? Maybe you want to start your own business and employ others or you'd like to work in the non-profit or public sector?

### PART III: Supporting your future {#partiii}

The third part of this book, contains supporting material that will help the design, build and test phases described above:

* The thirteenth chapter summarises the whole guidebook in [Ten Simple Rules for Coding your Future](ruling.html).
* The fourteenth chapter introduces you to some fictitious candidates and invites you to [Debug their CV](sampling.html)
* The fifteenth chapter looks at careers outside of the capital because it's [Not Just London](notjustlondon.html)
* The sixteenth chapter interviews students after returning from their placements in the [Coding your Future podcast](podcast.html)
* The seventeenth chapter shows how to emphasising your actions on your CV by putting the [verbs first](verbs.html)
* The [references section](references.html) provides the essential signposts alongside everything (yes, everything!) else I've cited in this guidebook

## Recurring themes {#themes}
Each chapter of the book contains the following sections:

1. **What you will learn** what I expect you to learn from a given chapter
1. **Video and audio** short videos to watch and sometimes audio to listen to
1. **Assessments** activities and quizzes that will be assessed either by yourself, your peers, an employer or an academic (depending on who you are)
1. **Coding challenges** are designed to take you out of your comfort zone by suggesting new experiments for you to try, some of these are thought experiments (think and discuss something) others are more practical (doing something)
1. **Essential signposts** - seriously useful resources that we recommend you read, listen to or watch
<!--1. **References** - Further reading, absolutely everything we've cited, not just the essential signposts-->
<!--in progress 1. **Quick quizzes** quick quizzes to test your knowledge-->
<!--in progress 1. **Puzzlers** are deliberately open-ended questions. There are no right or wrong answers to many of these questions, and some of them non-trivial to respond to. While you might be able to answer some questions relatively quickly, others may require more extensive research, reflection and discussion.-->

## Acknowledgements {#thanks}
The content of this book is based on hundreds of conversations I have had with (mostly) Computer Science students and their employers since 2012. I've also had significant support from academic colleagues in the Department of Computer Science  ([\@csmcr](https://twitter.com/csmcr)) and support staff at the University of Manchester. ([\@ManUniCareers](https://twitter.com/ManUniCareers), [\@alumniUoM](https://twitter.com/alumniUoM), [\@OfficialUoM](https://twitter.com/OfficialUoM))

### Thanks to students {#students}
First and foremost, I'd like to thank all the students who have helped with this book, both directly and indirectly. I can't name you all but if you have studied some flavour of Computer Science as an undergraduate at the University of Manchester since 2012, there's a good chance you have contributed to this book. Thank you!

I'd especially like to thank industrial experience (IE) students who completed a year in industry as part of their degree as well as those who have done summer internships, either as part of the Master of Engineering (MEng) program or otherwise. In addition, the [PASS leaders](http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk) and facilitators, [UniCSmcr.com](https://unicsmcr.com/),  HackSoc and [Manchester Ultimate Programming](https://github.com/Man-UP) members have all been influential on the content of this book. I've trawled through thousands of CVs too, so if you've shown me a copy of your CV, thanks! The chapter on [debugging your CV](#debugging) is based on the most common bugs (or are they features?) I've seen in CVs and resumes.

    link = glue::glue("[\\@{handle}]({link})"),
    desc = ifelse(is.na(fullname), link, glue::glue("{fullname} ({link})"))
  )
cat(paste0(contributors$desc, collapse = ", "))
```
-->


So, thank you students for being studious. üôè

### Thanks to employers {#employers}

Thanks to all the employers who have employed students from the Department of Computer Science as either summer interns, year long placement students or graduates. A big chunk of this guidebook documents students experience of recruitment by and employment with these employers.

<!--
```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
contributors <- readr::read_csv("data/employers.csv", col_types = list())
contributors <- contributors %>%
  mutate(
    link = glue::glue("[{employer}]({link})"),
    desc = ifelse(is.na(employer), link, glue::glue("{employer}{link}"))
  )
cat(paste0(contributors$desc, collapse = ", "))
```
-->

So, thanks employers for employing our students. üôè

### Thanks to colleagues {#colleagues}

Thanks to my academic colleagues and PhD students in the Department of Computer Science and the rest of the University of Manchester who have contributed directly (or indirectly) to this book. They include Sean Bechhofer, Gavin Brown, Barry Cheetham, Sarah Clinch, Clare Dixon, Suzanne Embury, Steve Furber, Jim Garside, Danielle George, Carole Goble, Peter Green, Simon Harper, Gareth Henshall, Toby Howard, Caroline Jay, Tim Morris, Colin Puleston, Paul Nutter, Steve Pettifer, Nancy Rothwell, Ulrike Sattler, Pejman Saeghe, Andrea Schalk, Robert Stevens, Tom Thomson, Markel Vigo, Louise Walker, Alex Walker and Crystal Wu.

I would especially like to thank [Jim Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_John_Miles) for encouraging me to write a book shortly after he offered me a job. To be honest, I thought he was nuts but it turned out to be another one of Jim's great ideas. Thanks Jim.

Optimists will tell you that ‚Äúeveryone has a book in them...‚Äù, although pessimists will tell you that ‚Äú...in most cases that's where it should remain‚Äù. [@everyone] Despite [Christoph Hitchens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens) amusing and trademark cynicism shown in figure \@ref(fig:hitchens-fig), I am an optimist when it comes to the power of natural languages.

### Thanks to Bryan Mathers {#visualthinkery}
Many of the illustrations for this book have been drawn by the very talented Bryan Mathers [\@BryanMMathers](https://twitter.com/BryanMMathers/). Bryan is an artist, visual thinker and entrepreneur, who also happens to have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Glasgow. His combined skills in art and science made him a the perfect fit for illustrating this guidebook. You can find out more about Bryan at [bryanmathers.com](https://bryanmmathers.com) and [visualthinkery.com](https://visualthinkery.com).

Thanks Bryan for your witty illustrations, this book wouldn't be the same without your visual thinkery. üôè

### Thanks to my friends and family {#family}  
Thanks to all my friends and family who have supported me from the beginning. To my mum, dad, brother, sister, wife, son, ŒºŒ±ŒºŒ¨, ŒºœÄŒ±ŒºœÄŒ¨ and extended family. I'm lucky to have been taught by you and that you've always there when I needed you.

So, thanks to all my family and friends for your love and friendship. Œ£Œµ Œ±Œ≥Œ±œÄœé œÄŒ±œÅŒ± œÄŒøŒªœç. üôè

### About me {#duncan}
Hello, my name is [Duncan Hull](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/) and I wrote this guidebook for undergraduate and postgraduate students. I'm a lecturer in the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/).

So what's *my* story? Like many people, my path has been what Helen Tupper and Sarah Ellis call a ‚Äúsquiggly career‚Äù rather than classic linear one. [@squiggly] I've been gainfully employed as a paperboy, supermarket cashier, shelf stacker, sausage factory worker, pork pie filler, chef, dogsbody, field assistant, database administrator, consultant, juror, high school teacher, postdoc, research scientist, software engineer, lecturer, external examiner, tutor and academic.

I've done a range of voluntary work too, serving as a competition judge, fundraiser, rabble rouser, [code club](https://codeclub.org) \& [coderdojo](https://coderdojo.com) leader, [digital council](https://www.manchesterdigital.com/) member, [school governor](https://governorsforschools.org.uk/), curator, beer drinker, [wikipedia trainer](https://wiki-loves-scientists.org.uk/) and editor. But as Ronnie Lane and Ronnie Wood once said:

> ‚ÄúI wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger.‚Äù ---Ronnie Lane [@faces]

This guidebook documents some of what I know now, that I wish I'd known, when I was younger. If you're starting your career, I hope you find these insights useful. I've sat on both sides of the interview table, as interviewer and interviewee. I have had some spectacular wipeout failures, alongside some modest successes, and have included personal stories where they are relevant.

Most of what I have learned about employment comes from listening to, and watching students interact with employers as they take the first tentative steps in their careers. I've documented some of what they taught me, so reading this book may help you learn from some of their successes and mistakes.
