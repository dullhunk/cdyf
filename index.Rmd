Welcome to Coding Your Future, the guidebook that will help you to design, build, test, debug and code your future in computing. This guidebook is aimed at students in higher education, both those studying Computer Science as part of their degree or those from other disciplines with an interest in computing.

This guidebook supports second year teaching at the University of Manchester, but it DOES NOT MATTER:

* what *stage* of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year
* what *level* you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate
* what *subject* you are studying, although curiosity about computing is desirable
* what *institution* you are studying at, this book is University agnostic
* *where* in the world you are studying

So there is something in this guidebook for every student of computing. 🌎🌍🌏

<!--todo check github-repo-->

## Aims of this guidebook

*Coding your future* explores techniques for making career decisions, job searching, submitting applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace.

Alongside these practical engineering issues, this guidebook also encourages you to *design your future* by taking a step back and reflecting on the bigger picture. You will apply [computational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking) techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people and what your experience is. As there is a computational theme, you will also need to reflect on what your inputs and outputs ([I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output)) are, both now and in the future. You'll also need to think about what recipes (or algorithms) you might start experimenting with

This guidebook tackles professional issues in computing, for those with and without Computer Science degrees in the early stage of their careers.

<!--We will also discuss some algorithms (recipes) that you might like to try-->

## What you will (and won't) learn {#bilo}

After reading this guidebook, watching the videos and doing the exercises you will be able to:

1. Improve your self-awareness by describing who you are, what motivates you and your strengths and weaknesses
1. Decide on a job search strategy and identify employers, sectors and roles that are of interest to you		
1. Improve your written communication skills both for job applications and collaborating with other people
1. Plan and prepare competitive written applications using standard techniques including CVs, covering letters, application forms and digital profiles
1. Compete successfully in interviews and assessment centres by preparing for technical and non-technical questions
1. Plan further steps in your career such as promotion, postgraduate study & research, alternative employment and longer term goals

This book will NOT teach you how to write code, there's already lots of fantastic resources to help you do that. We discuss some of them in chapter six [Computing Your Future](#computing).

### Prerequisites {#prereq}
As the title of this guidebook implies, there is a computational flavour here, but you do not have to be studying Computer Science to benefit. There are two main target audiences for this guidebook:

1. Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of their degree. This includes software engineering, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction (HCI), information systems, health informatics, data science, gaming, cybersecurity and all the other myriad flavours of Computer Science
1. Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying *any* subject, with little or no Computer Science at all. You are curious to know about what role computing could play in your future career. Computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists.

So the prerequisites for this book are that you are studying (or have studied) at University where English is one of the main spoken languages. You *may* have some experience already, either casual, voluntary or otherwise, but this book does **not** assume that you have already been employed in some capacity.

### Don't read this, gut it! {#gut}
I don't recommend you read this book from cover to cover in one sitting. Instead, I suggest you follow the advice given to historian [William Woodruff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodruff) about reading books when he was at University:

> “You don't READ books, you GUT them!” [@nabend] 🐟

So, gut this book like a fish. Identify the chapters that are most useful to you (the flesh), and skip the rest (the guts). Which chapters are flesh and which are guts will depend on what stage of the journey you are at. This guidebook is designed to be as “guttable” as possible.
To aid gutting, the version published at [cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me/) has a built in search and tables of contents. Before you can gut the fish, you'll need a map.

## Mapping your future {#mapping}
<!-- or should it be structuring-->
This guidebook is split into three parts. The first part is on [designing your future](bothering.html) while the second is on [building and testing your future](debugging.html) shown in the map in Figure \@ref(fig:map-fig). The final part is a [help](ruling.html) section, for supporting your future. Let's look in a bit more detail at the content of each of the three parts of this guidebook:

```{r map-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmapping)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Course Map.png")
```
(ref:captionmapping) Mapping your future: Each yellow dot on this diagram is a chapter in *Coding Your Future*. The chapters on the left tackle design issues like *who are you*? Chapters on the right tackle the practicalities of executing and testing your career choices, such as *debugging your CV*.

### Designing your future {#parti}

The first part of this guidebook (chapters 1 to 6) looks at what engineers call *design*. When you build anything, a bridge, a piece of software, a car or a plane you'll need to do some design. Building a career isn't that different to building anything else, you'll need to do some design work and it will probably be iterative. Designing things often involves asking tricky questions. So when you're designing your future you'll need to cover the following:

* The first chapter [why bother?](bothering.html) looks at why you should bother reading any of this book
* The second chapter [who are you?](knowing.html) challenges you to reflect on who you are, what makes you unique and why you are here
* The third chapter looks at [your well-being](wellbeing.html), and how to take care of your mental and physical health
* The fourth chapter [soft skills are hard](communicating.html) explores your soft skills, how they complement your hard skills and why employers value them so much
* The fifth chapter [are you experienced?](experiencing.html) asks you to reflect on your work experience and help identify where you can improve it
* The sixth chapter [computing your future](computing.html) looks at the role computing can play in your career, with or without a Computer Science degree


### Building and testing your future {#partii}
The next six chapters look at building and testing your future, what engineers like to call *implementation* or *execution*. Once you've started to answer the design questions in the first part, you can start to implement (or build) your career and think about what the next steps will be.

* The seventh chapter helps you to [debug your CV](debugging.html) alongside other written communication such as covering letters,  application forms and digital portfolios.
* The eighth chapter looks at [your job search and networks](finding.html), where can you look for interesting opportunities
* The ninth chapter looks [your interviews and offers](interviewing.html), how can you turn interviews to your advantage and negotiate any offers you receive
* The tenth chapter looks at [your survival and promotion](surviving.html), once you've landed a job, how will you survive and thrive outside (and after) University
* The eleventh chapter looks at [postgraduate study](studying.html) is a Masters degree or a PhD right for you?
* The twelfth chapter looks at [your alternatives](broadening.html) and encourages you to broaden your horizons. Perhaps you could be a freelancer or contractor? Maybe you want to start your own business and employ others or you'd like to work in the non-profit or public sector? The possibilities are endless.

### Supporting your future {#partiii}

The third part of this book, contains supporting material that will help the design, build and test phases described above:

* The thirteenth chapter summarises the whole guidebook in [Ten Simple Rules for Coding your Future](ruling.html).
* The fourteenth chapter introduces you to some fictitious candidates and invites you to [Debug their CV](sampling.html)
* The fifteenth chapter looks at careers outside of the capital because it's [Not Just London](notjustlondon.html)
* The sixteenth chapter interviews students after returning from their placements in the [Coding your Future podcast](podcast.html)
* The seventeenth chapter shows how to emphasising your actions on your CV by putting the [verbs first](verbs.html)
* The [references section](references.html) provides the essential signposts alongside everything (yes, everything!) else I've cited in this guidebook
<!--

* A soundtrack, also available as a Spotify and YouTube playlist
-->

## Recurring themes {#themes}
Each chapter of the book contains the following sections:

1. **What you will learn** what I expect you to learn from a given chapter
1. **Video and audio** short videos to watch and sometimes audio to listen to
1. **Assessments** activities and quizzes that will be assessed either by yourself, your peers, an employer or an academic (depending on who and where you are)
1. **Coding challenges** are designed to take you out of your comfort zone by suggesting new experiments for you to try, some of these are thought experiments (think about or discuss something) others are more practical (doing something)
1. **Essential signposts** - seriously useful resources that we recommend you read, listen to or watch
<!--1. **References** - Further reading, absolutely everything we've cited, not just the essential signposts-->
<!--in progress 1. **Quick quizzes** quick quizzes to test your knowledge-->
<!--in progress 1. **Puzzlers** are deliberately open-ended questions. There are no right or wrong answers to many of these questions, and some of them non-trivial to respond to. While you might be able to answer some questions relatively quickly, others may require more extensive research, reflection and discussion.-->

## Acknowledgements {#thanks}
The content of this book is based on hundreds of conversations I have had with (mostly) Computer Science students and their employers since 2012.

### Standing on the shoulders of students {#students}
First and foremost, I'd like to thank all the students who have helped with this book, both directly and indirectly.

> “If I have seen further it is by [standing on the shoulders of students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants).” [@newton]

So, if you have studied some flavour of Computer Science at the University of Manchester since 2012, there's a high probability you have contributed to this book. Thank you for listening to me, being ambitious, hard working, talented, fearless, creative and inspirational. It has been my pleasure and privilege to work with you all.

I'd especially like to thank industrial experience (IE) students who completed a year in industry as part of their degree as well as those who have done summer internships, either as part of the Master of Engineering (MEng) program or otherwise. In addition, the [PASS leaders](http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk) and facilitators, [UniCSmcr.com](https://unicsmcr.com/), [HackSoc](https://github.com/unicsmcr/hacksoc.com),  [CSSoc](https://github.com/cssoc) and [Manchester Ultimate Programming](https://github.com/Man-UP) members have all been influential on the content of this book. I've learned heaps by manually trawling through thousands of your CVs too, so if you've shown me a copy of your CV, thanks! The chapters on [debugging your CV](debugging.html) (self assessment) and [debugging their CV](sampling.html) (peer assessment) are based on the most common bugs (or are they features?) I've seen in CVs.

Thanks to Niall Beard and [Sharif Salah](https://github.com/sharifsalah) at Google for introducing me to Google's Technical Writing course. [@googling]

So, thanks employers for employing our students. 🙏

### Thanks to colleagues {#colleagues}
I've also had significant support from academic colleagues in the Department of Computer Science  ([\@csmcr](https://twitter.com/csmcr)) and support staff at the University of Manchester. ([\@ManUniCareers](https://twitter.com/ManUniCareers), [\@alumniUoM](https://twitter.com/alumniUoM), [\@OfficialUoM](https://twitter.com/OfficialUoM))

I would especially like to thank [Jim Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_John_Miles) for encouraging me to write a book shortly after he offered me a job. I thought he was joking (about the book) but it actually turned out to be another one of Jim's great ideas. Thanks Jim. 🙏

Optimists will tell you that “everyone has a book in them...”, but pessimists like [Christoph Hitchens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens) will add that “...in most cases that's where it should remain”. [@everyone] Despite Hitchens amusing trademark cynicism shown in figure \@ref(fig:hitchens-fig), I am an optimist when it comes to the power of natural languages.

### Thanks to Bryan Mathers {#visualthinkery}
Many of the illustrations for this book have been drawn by the very talented Bryan Mathers [\@BryanMMathers](https://twitter.com/BryanMMathers/). Bryan is an artist, visual thinker and entrepreneur, who also happens to have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Glasgow. His combined skills in art, science and engineering made him the perfect fit for illustrating this guidebook. You can find out more about Bryan at [bryanmathers.com](https://bryanmmathers.com) and [visualthinkery.com](https://visualthinkery.com). I'm *so* glad we randomly bumped into each other at a conference.

So, thanks Bryan for your witty illustrations, this book wouldn't be the same without your visual thinkery.  🙏

### Thanks to my friends {#friends}  
Thanks to my friends, especially those who I've enjoyed singing, live music and dancing with. I hope we can sing and dance together to live music again before too long.

So, thank you friends for your friendship. 🙏

### Thanks to my family {#family}  
To my mum, dad, brother, sister, wife, son, μαμά, μπαμπά and extended family: I'm lucky to have been taught by you and that you've always been there when I needed you.

So, thanks to all my family for your unconditional love. Σε αγαπώ παρα πολύ. 🙏

## About me {#duncan}
Hello, my name is [Duncan Hull](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/) and I wrote this guidebook for students at the University of Manchester where I'm a lecturer (≈ [Assistant Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_professor)) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/).

So what's *my* story? Like many people, my path has been what [Helen Tupper](https://twitter.com/HelenTupper) and Sarah Ellis call a “squiggly career” rather than classic linear one. [@squiggly] I've been gainfully employed as a paperboy, supermarket cashier, shelf stacker, sausage factory worker, pork pie filler, chef, dogsbody, field assistant, database administrator, deli counter server, consultant, matchday steward, juror, high school teacher, postdoc, research scientist, software engineer, lecturer, external examiner, tutor and academic.

I've done a range of voluntary work too, serving as a competition judge, fundraiser, rabble rouser, [code club](https://codeclub.org) \& [coderdojo](https://coderdojo.com) leader, [digital council](https://www.manchesterdigital.com/) member, [school governor](https://governorsforschools.org.uk/), curator, beer drinker, [wikipedia trainer](https://wiki-loves-scientists.org.uk/), [journal clubber](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) and editor. But as Ronnie Lane and Ronnie Wood once said:

> “I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger.” ---Ronnie Lane [@faces]

This guidebook documents some of what I know now, that I wish I'd known, when I was younger. If you're starting your career, I hope you find these insights useful. I've sat on both sides of the interview table, as interviewer and interviewee. I have had some spectacular failures, alongside some modest successes, and have included personal stories where they are relevant.

Most of what I have learned about employment comes from listening to, and watching students interact with employers as they take the first tentative steps in their careers. I've documented some of what they taught me, so reading this book may help you learn from some of their successes and mistakes.
