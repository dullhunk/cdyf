# Scheduling your future {#scheduling}
You might find it a bit scary thinking about your future. You might be tempted to procrastinate making important decisions about your future, see figure \@ref(fig:schedule-fig). There is a risk of getting stuck in a `do-nothing` or [busy waiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting) loop. This guidebook is here to help you break out of that loop. One way to breakout of an unproductive loop is to schedule some personal development time every week where you work on job applications. Doing good applications takes time and you'll probably find you can't do as many applications as you might like.

```{r schedule-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionschedule)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/is-it-just-me.png")
```
(ref:captionschedule) The biggest waste of time is the time spent not getting started on a project. Your future might seem big and unknown but it's really not as scary as you might think and getting started can be surprisingly enjoyable. [New Project?

If you're a University of Manchester student, the live *Coding your Future* (COMP2CARS) sessions are also here to help. They'll be back in September 2021, see [manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/). In the meantime see the *Wednesday Waggle* at [waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk](https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/)


COMP2CARS complements the second year tutorials (COMP2TUT) at the University of Manchester and takes place in the same slot as COMP2TUT when you meet your personal tutor. See the timetable [studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/timetable](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/timetable/).

For small group sessions and one-to-one meetings with your tutor, please turn your camera on, see section \@ref(cameras).




<!--These sessions will revisit themes from semester one if you missed them last semester, we'll also have an open session where we'll tackle whatever issues you need about finding placements and internships during 2021. We'll be meeting at [zoom.us/my/duncanhull](http://zoom.us/my/duncanhull), please sign into zoom with your \@student.manchester.ac.uk account and if you can, -->

##  Cameras on or off? {#cameras}
I would normally expect participants in small meetings (not large ones like lectures) to turn their cameras on but I understand that there are good reasons why people may not be willing/able to and won‚Äôt explicitly ask you to.

### Why turn cameras on?
There has always been a question around whether to turn cameras on during online meetings but it is even more obvious with online meetings becoming the norm rather than the exception.  I see a direct benefit in using cameras in small, personal meetings where many of us make use of visual cues to aid the flow of conversation ‚Äì at the very least it‚Äôs easier to identify who is talking. Additionally, it can help people get along ‚Äì people might feel more ‚Äòlistened to‚Äô if they can see somebody listening and personally I find it easier to remember names etc if I have a face to match the names to. I will generally have my camera on and will continue to keep it on even if I am the only one.

### Why not?
There are lots of reasons why not. Most obviously, if you don‚Äôt have access to a camera. But you may also be in an environment which you prefer others not to see, you may have anxiety around the issue, or your connection might be too slow. There are many other perfectly reasonable reasons for you not to put your camera on and you should not feel pressured to do this. If you simply say ‚ÄúSorry, I can‚Äôt turn my camera on today‚Äù then I won‚Äôt ask any further and I will never explicitly ask you to turn it on.

### Being appropriate
You should already be treating online meetings like physical ones e.g. turning up on time, being prepared, listening, engaging etc. Similarly, if people can see you then you should ensure you are wearing appropriate clothes (wearing clothes is the absolute minimum here!) and in an appropriate place (the bathroom is probably not appropriate) as you would for a physical meeting.

### Respecting others
If other people have decided to turn their cameras on then I ask that you show them respect by not recording anything without explicit permission. I won‚Äôt touch on the legality of this as I believe that basic respect for each other should be enough to prevent any issues. You will take part in larger meetings where recording may be standard and in such cases this should be made explicit.
