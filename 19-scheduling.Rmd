# Scheduling your future {#scheduling}
You might find it a bit scary thinking about your future. You might be tempted to procrastinate making important decisions about your future, see figure \@ref(fig:schedule-fig). There is a risk of getting stuck in a `do-nothing` or [`busy waiting`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting) loop. This guidebook is here to help you break out of that loop. One way to breakout of an unproductive loop is to schedule some time every week where you work on personal development and job applications. Doing good applications takes time and you'll probably find you can't do as many applications as you might like.

```{r schedule-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionschedule)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/is-it-just-me.png")
```
(ref:captionschedule) The biggest waste of time is the time spent not getting started on a project. Your future might seem big and unknown but it's really not as scary as you might think and getting started can be surprisingly enjoyable. [New Project?

If you're a University of Manchester student, the live *Coding your Future* (COMP2CARS) workshops sessions are also here to help.
COMP2CARS complements the second year tutorials (COMP2TUT) at the University of Manchester and takes place in the same slot as COMP2TUT when you meet your personal tutor. See your timetable at [timetables.manchester.ac.uk](https://timetables.manchester.ac.uk/).

Live on campus session of *Coding your Future* (COMP2CARS and COMP2TUT) will return in September 2022 see [timetables.manchester.ac.uk](https://timetables.manchester.ac.uk/) for details.
