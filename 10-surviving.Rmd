## Survive, thrive or dive? {#scenarios}

Simply put, there are three scenarios for you as a new employee. You'll survive, thrive or dive.

### Survive {#survive}

It will go OK, you'll meet the expectations of your employer and become and valued employee. Most employees fit in to this category.


### Thrive  
It will go brilliantly, you'll exceed the expectations of your employer. If you're on a fixed term contract, such as a summer internship or year long placement, they'll make you a job offer during or soon after your contract of employment expires. If you're on a more permanent contract, such as a graduate job or graduate scheme you'll be promoted and given more responsibility.

You're doing well if you can impress your manager. Some people make it into this cateogory.


### Dive

It will go badly, you will struggle to fit in and won't meet the expectations of your employer. If things get really bad, your employer may [take disciplinary action agasint you](https://www.gov.uk/disciplinary-procedures-and-action-at-work) [@dive] and in the worst case scenario, you'll be [fired (dismissed)](https://www.gov.uk/dismissal). [@yourefired] Alternatively, you might decide to you want to [hand in your notice](https://www.gov.uk/handing-in-your-notice) to terminate your contract of employment and leave. [@iquit]

Dismissal is rare, but it does happen, even to interns and placement students. In this scenario in the UK, the employer has a duty to do everything they reasonably can to prevent this from happening. It's not in their interests to fire you k
