# Surviving your future {#surviving}

Congratulations, you've just accepted an offer of employment. You nailed that interview (or interviews) and you're just about to embark on the exciting journey from the world of study to the world of employment. This *might* be your first SERIOUS job, so what do you need to survive? Even better, how can you thrive in your new role and take on the challenges that are coming your way? How will you optimise your trajectory to reach new heights? 🚀

(ref:captionbadges) Your education doesn't finish when you start work, it should be a loop where you constantly acquire knowledge and skills during your career. You don't stop learning when you leave University.

## Survive, thrive or dive? {#scenarios}
Starting a new job is a bit like starting a new relationship. You've been through the courtship of recruitment, this might have been quick or may have had many rounds of first and second dates. Now you're both committed to each other and starting the relationship for real. Simply put, there are three scenarios for you as a new employee. You'll survive, thrive or dive.

### Survive {#survive}

It will go OK, you'll meet the expectations of your employer and become and valued employee. Most employees fit in to this category. 🆗


### Thrive  {#thrive}
It will go brilliantly, you'll exceed the expectations of your employer. If you're on a fixed term contract, such as a summer internship or year long placement, they'll make you a job offer during or soon after your contract of employment expires. If you're on a more permanent contract, such as a graduate job or graduate scheme you'll be promoted and given more responsibility. 💪

You're doing really well if you can impress your manager. Some lucky people make it into this category.


### Dive {#dive}

It will go badly, you will struggle to fit in and won't meet the expectations of your employer. Once you were [star-crossed lovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-crossed), but now the relationship has turned tragically sour. [@romeo; @goblewroe] There are several ways that you might breakup with (or be dumped by) your newly estranged lover. 💔

* If things get really bad, your employer may [take disciplinary action against you](https://www.gov.uk/disciplinary-procedures-and-action-at-work) [@dive] and in the worst case scenario, you'll be [fired (dismissed)](https://www.gov.uk/dismissal). [@yourefired]
* Alternatively, you might decide to you want to [hand in your notice](https://www.gov.uk/handing-in-your-notice) to terminate your contract of employment and leave. [@iquit]

Dismissal is rare, but it **does** happen, even to interns and placement students. In this scenario in the UK, the employer has a duty to do everything they reasonably can to prevent this from happening. It's not your employers interests to fire you because they've invested a lot of time and money in you by this point. If they have sensible recruitment procedures, those procedures will root out unsuitable candidates long before they make it to the workplace where they can cause real and lasting damage to the organisation once in post.

## Placement visits {#visits}

During your placement you will be visited by an academic member of staff. This is a good opportunity to reflect on what progress you have made during the year alongside areas you need to improve. You will probably already have had similar meetings with your manager or managers. There are three basic questions your tutor will ask you:

1. What have you been doing?
1. WWW: What Went Well?
1. EBI: Even Better If?

### What have you been doing?
Briefly describe your roles and responsibilities during your placement to date. What projects have you worked on? What were the main technologies that you used?

### WWW: What went well?
Are there any projects you are particularly proud of? What new knowledge or skills have your learnt or improved? Remember to include both non-technical as well as technical aspects of your job. Non-technical skills include organisation, time-management, confidence, communication etc.

### EBI: Even Better If?
What areas have you identified for improvement in the future? Again, this includes non-technical as well as technical skills.

### Managers comments
Your tutor will ask your manager to ask the same questions. Are there any differences between your view and your managers view of your placement? If so, why do you differ?

### Placement report
Both your tutor and you need to fill in the placement report, no more than two pages. See the [industrial placement report template on overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/industrial-placement-report/vcjymrgmcpzh)

## Summarising survival {#tldr10}

[Too long, didn't read](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read) (TL;DR)? Here's a summary:

This chapter is under construction because I'm using agile space station development methods, see figure \@ref(fig:deathstar7-fig).
