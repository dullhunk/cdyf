# Actioning your future {#actioning}

Employers are often more interested in what you have *done*, rather than what you just *know*. Your actions are a key part of your story we discussed in section \@ref(carstar). A simple technique for emphasising your actions is to lead the description of it with carefully chosen verbs.

## Your actions define your impact {#impact}
Your actions define your impact, see figure \@ref(fig:action-fig). What are the stories you can tell with yours verbs and their actions? What was the context, action and result (CAR) we discussed in section \@ref(carstar) on each short story?

```{r action-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionactions)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/your-actions.png")
```
(ref:captionactions) What action have you taken and what stories can you tell about the results and your impact? What are the best verbs for highlighting your actions?

By leading with verbs you will highlight what you have *actually done* rather than what you *think* you know. See the verbs first section \@ref(verbsfirst) of chapter \@ref(debugging) *debugging your future*.

* Have you over-used certain verbs (like *worked* or *assisted* for example)
* How can you increase the variety of verbs you have used (without exaggerating or lying)?
