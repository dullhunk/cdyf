# Actioning your future {#actioning}

Employers are often more interested in what you have *done*, rather than what you just *know*. Your actions are a key part of your story we discussed in section \@ref(carstar). A simple technique for emphasising your actions is to lead  descriptions of your projects, education and experience with carefully chosen verbs, see section \@ref(verbsfirst) for examples.

## Your actions define your impact {#impact}
Your actions define your impact, see figure \@ref(fig:action-fig). What stories you can tell of your actions to date? What verbs best describe how you achieved a result or had an impact? What was the context, action and result (CAR) we discussed in section \@ref(carstar) of each short story?

```{r action-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionactions)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/your-actions.png")
```
(ref:captionactions) What action have you taken and what stories can you tell about the results and your impact? What are the best verbs for highlighting your actions?

By leading with verbs you will highlight what you have *actually done* and how you did it, rather than what you know. See the verbs first section \@ref(verbsfirst) of chapter \@ref(debugging) *debugging your future*.

## What you will learn {#ilo17}

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

* Emphasise your *actions* when describing your education, projects and experience
* Reflect on
  + what skills you already have

## Breakpoints {#bp17}

Before you start, here are some [breakpoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint) for you to pause and consider. Quickly scan your CV, covering letter or application form for VERBS:

* Where are the verbs?
* Are verbs buried deep in long sections of prose or do they prominently lead descriptions of your activities?
* Have you over-used certain verbs (like *worked* or *assisted* for example)
* How can you increase the variety of verbs you have used (without exaggerating or lying)?
* Which verbs are stronger than others and why?
* Are there any categories of verbs you can't provide evidence for, such as leadership (see section \@ref(leading)) or influencing (see section \@ref(influencing))?
* What activities or projects could you do that would help you develop these missing skills?
