# Moving your future {#moving}

Finding a job often involves moving to another city or even another country. So a simple way to improve your job prospects is to broaden your job search (chapter \@ref(finding)) and consider all the alternatives, geographically and otherwise. Some of the alternative options are outlined in chapter \@ref(broadening). This chapter looks at some UK alternatives to London.

(ref:captionnojustlondon) Like many capital cities, London dominates the economy of its country. There are clearly some fantastic employers offering great opportunities in London but they do not represent everything that is on offer in the UK. There are plenty of good career options outside of capital cities like London if you don't want to live and work in a huge metropolis. Not just London Image by Sharon Dale [@notjustlondon]

For example, if you're seeking work or further study in the United Kingdom, there are lots of possibilities in [Loxbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxbridge) (**Lo**ndon, **Ox**ford and Cam**bridge**). While Loxbridge undoubtedly offers many fantastic opportunities for professional growth and development, it does not represent *all* of the best opportunities that exist in the UK. <!--LOxbridge is a fortified triangular castle bound London and its two most significant suburbs, Oxford and Cambridge.-->

So, it's wrong to assume that capital cities like London are where *all* the best opportunities are. That's true in the UK and also in many other countries too. You might need to consider moving your future.

This is a partial list of employers in the North West of England (aka the [Northern Powerhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Powerhouse)) that recruit Computer Science students. This is not a comprehensive list of all tech companies in the North West, but will give you a quick flavour of employers in the Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Northern England.

## Hit the North, Not Just London
You don't have to move to London to find top employers, there are plenty located here in the North West if you'd like to stick around after you graduate and [Hit the North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_the_North). [@hitthenorth] Northerners have often argued that Northern England offers a better quality of life than London we couldn't possibly comment other than to say its horses for courses. The North West Tech Community calendar, provides a window on (and networking opportunities with) many of employers based in the North West technw.uk if you want to find out more. To quote sharon dale, its NotJustLondon [@notjustlondon]

The list of employers in this page is currently being migrated from [git.io/manc](https://git.io/manc), visit that page for a list of employers from the North West.

## techUK  and technation.io
In addition to these [techuk.org](https://www.techuk.org) and [technation.io](https://technation.io) provide more information on technology businesses outside of London.

## Guest lectures from employers {#guestlectures}

The Department of Computer Science welcomes external speakers and hosts a number of guest lectures from a wide range of collaborators in industry and academia. There are several ways the department can host guest lectures

* Scheduled lectures for [COMP101](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP10120/syllabus/), a first year course with 400+ enrolled students. During 2021, these talks take place on Mondays from midday to 12.50pm on zoom
* School research seminars , see [examples of past seminars](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/events/past-events/)
* Technical talks arranged as part of a scheduled course, speak to the [course leader for the relevant course](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about/people/). These tend to be more advanced courses aimed at students later in their degrees or as part of postgraduate study.
* One-off talks arranged *ad hoc* that are not part of scheduled series of lectures
* Seminars and talks from speakers arranged and booked by students, for example [unicsmcr.com](https://unicsmcr.com/), The University of Manchester Computer Science society

### Examples of COMP101 lectures

Some example guest lectures for COMP101 are shown below to give a flavour of the kind of talks that are appropriate

* Hacking the Hacks, delivered by NCC Group
* Debunking the myths associated with User Experience, delivered by American Express
* The Business of Intellectual Property, delivered by Imagination Technology)
* How to Break a Hacker's Mind, Web Application Vulnerabilities Exposed, delivered by Morgan Stanley
* 100 billion ARM chips, delivered by ARM
* Software at Airbus
* Computing in the Community, delivered by CodeClub & Manchester Girl Geeks
* How to be a brilliant software engineer, delivered by Apadmi


### Interested in speaking?
For COMP101, we are always looking for good speakers who can engage large groups of students on interesting topics that they care about and relate to Computer Science. For COMP101, there are a limited number of guest lecture slots (around 20) which run through term-time starting in November and finishing in early June. Its important that speakers

* Give much more than a sales pitch for an organisation, by providing insight into a technical subject
* Talk about content that relates to the (very broad) syllabus of COMP101
* Engage, interact, educate and entertain. Students vote with their feet (by not turning up) if they think a lecture won't be interesting
* If you would like to propose a guest lecture for COMP101, please [contact Duncan Hull](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/contact.html). For all other external seminars and events, see the links above.

Since lockdown, lectures have been online, which has allowed for more interaction, typically via the chat dialogue. We can monitor and moderate the chat, feeding questions to the speaker when it's appropriate.
