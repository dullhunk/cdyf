# Computing your future {#computing}

It's difficult to think of any aspect of our lives that hasn't been changed by the invention of the digital computer, just 70 short years ago. Consequently, computing is a crucial skill in a wide range of careers across every sector of business and society. You don't have to have studied Computer Science at University to take advantage of all the exciting opportunities provided by computing. This chapter looks at why computing is a subject for everyone. If you're studying computing, this chapter isn't aimed at you, unless you are struggling to stay motivated with your subject! üë®üèø‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíªüë©üèΩ‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíªüë®üèø‚Äçüíª

## What you will learn {#ilo6}
Reading this chapter and doing the activities will help you to:

* Identify where you can get started with computing, if you're not studying computer science as a major part of your degree
* Describe why NOT studying computer science doesn't necessarily ‚Äúlock you out‚Äù of computing as a career

<!--* Describe why computing is a stimulating and challenging subject to study in its own right
* Identify creative opportunities in computing, whatever your background-->

## Computing: your future? {#copps}

What role will computing play in your future career? A Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University, [Robert Sedgwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)), has, like many others, argued that Computer Science should be required of all students:

> Every college student needs a computer science course, and most need two or more. More and more educators are
> beginning to recognize this truth, but we are a long way from meeting the need. --Robert Sedgwick [@robertsedgwick]

<!--
The gist of his argument is that Computer Science is too important to be left to Computer Scientists, because it influences every field of human endeavour.

## Too important for Computer Scientists
-->

But why should everyone be studying computing? There are social and economic arguments:

### Computing is creative and expressive {#creative}

At school, everyone learns to the read, write and do maths. These are sometimes known as [the three Rs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_three_Rs) but:

* Why did you learn to read and write? Was it so that you could become a professional writer?
* Why did you study mathematics? Was it so that you could become a professional mathematician?

Of course not, that would be ludicrous! You learned to read and write because they are fundamental tools for expressing yourself and communicating with other people. You studied maths so that you could develop numeracy, reason about the world around you, analyse data and solve problems.

So why should everyone learn about computing? Is it so that everyone can become software engineers? Why should you learn about computing? Is it so that you can become a software engineer? Again, this is ludicrous.

Everyone should study computing for the same reasons everyone studies maths and english at school. Like writing, computing is one of the most creative tools for expression and communication that we have today. Just like mathematics, studying computing will also help you to solve important problems too. Sam Aaron, creator of [Sonic Pi](hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Pi), puts exactly this case for creative computing in his TEDx talk [@youtube-sonicpi] shown in figure \@ref(fig:sonicpi-fig).

```{r sonicpi-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionsonicpi)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/youtube-sonicpi.png")
```
(ref:captionsonicpi) Sam Aaron puts the creative case for computing by discussing programming as performance in his TEDx talk. [@youtube-sonicpi] The image in this figure is a screenshot, [watch the 18 minute video on programming as performance here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lTZ8Tuyu5I).

Computing is also an intellectually stimulating and challenging subject to study in its own right. If you don't believe me, I'm not going to make the case here. Have a look at Silvio Peroni's free computational thinking and programming book at [comp-think.github.io](https://comp-think.github.io/)  which is written for people with a background in the humanities. [@peroni]

### Computing is eating the world {#eating}
Besides the social arguments, there are also strong economic reasons for studying computing. In 2011, the software engineer and billionaire investor [Marc Andreesen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen) argued that [software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). [@eatingtheworld] It's actually the combination of software *and* hardware that dominates the list of the world's largest corporations by market capitalisation, shown in figure \@ref(fig:market-fig). So it's not just software that's eating the world but computing.

```{r market-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionmarket)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Market_Capitalisation.png")
```
(ref:captionmarket) If stock markets are anything to go by, computing is eating the world. It would be impossible for Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook to exist without computing. The economic weight of [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) graphic by YBSLE on Wikimedia Commons [w.wiki/3KEU](https://w.wiki/3KEU)

Even if you don't want to work for any of these global monopolies, their success is good news for *all* students of computing because it shows how important computation is to society, both commercially and otherwise. For example, demand for software developers is high, comparable to teaching and nursing in terms of numbers. In the UK, the most common jobs for graduates from 2017-18 are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:nurses-fig), based on data taken from an article on [the graduate labour market in 2021](https://wonkhe.com/blogs/what-might-the-graduate-labour-market-look-like-in-2021/) [@wonkyball]

```{r nurses-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionball)"}
library(ggplot2)
nursesdata <- tribble(
  ~profession,        ~graduates,
  "A nurses",           9800,
  "B marketing",        4575,
  "C nursery & primary teachers",       4295,
  "D software developers", 4160
)

ggplot(data = nursesdata) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = profession, y = graduates), stat="identity")
```

(ref:captionball) The most common jobs for graduates in the UK in 2017-18, demand for software developers is high according to data published by Charlie Ball [@wonkyball]

So there's lots of choice and lots on offer, wherever you are in the world.

### Play your joker: Computational joker {#joker}
Because of its social and economic importance, computing also gives you flexibility. If academic disciplines are [playing card suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card_suit), then Computer Science is the [joker in the pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(playing_card)) shown in figure \@ref(fig:joker-fig). A versatile card, the computational joker can be played with (and without) any of the traditional four suits: diamonds, clubs, hearts and spades. That's because computing is a science *and* an art. It allows us to study human society and culture, so it's part of the [humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities) too. Last but not least, computing is also an engineering discipline and a branch of mathematics too. What all this means is that the computational joker is a [wild card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(cards)) that can be played *whenever and wherever* you like, making it an incredibly powerful but dangerous card, depending on the game you are playing (see chapter \@ref(broadening)). ‚ô£‚ô•‚ô†‚ô¶üÉè

```{r joker-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionjoker)"}

The flexibility of computing as a career means you have a broad range of options on where you can apply your computational skills. You don't *have* to be studying Computer Science to take advantage of these opportunities, but it helps.

## Summarising computing your future {#tldr6}

[Too long, didn't read](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read) (TL;DR)? Here's a summary:

This chapter is under construction because I'm using agile book development methods, see figure \@ref(fig:deathstar3-fig).

## Google Summer of Code

https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-advice

and also

look
advice via  Bujanca:

1. Read the entire GSoC site including materials
1. What computer science subject area or specific issue or problem interests you? What are your skills? What languages do you know? What tools are you familiar with?
1. Look through the list of organisations. There's a lot of them, it might be slightly overwhelming, but you'll need to narrow it down. Pick at most 5 of them. You won't have time to look at all of them in depth so follow your interests and gut feeling.
1. Visit the org's site and repos. Look at the code, look at feature requests, issues and bug reports

* Look at the past projects of those 5. It'll become clear that some of them are generally very competitive and usually take final year or masters students for their projects. Narrow it down to 3 organisations.

1. Start engaging with mentors and other students or the community around those 3 organisations. Again, it'll become clear which projects within each organisation are the most popular. Ask for advice. Read project descriptions and draft lists of questions.
1. By the time the student application period begins, you should know which organisation you are going for, even if you're not sure about the project yet.
1. As soon as you picked a project, start working on your proposal, and start asking for feedback early on. You don't have to have a finished proposal to ask for feedback, mentors are more often than not willing to guide you.
1. Your proposal has to highlight two things well: how your background and experience are relevant to the project, and your understanding of the project. The understanding of the project part is crucial: successful applicants usually have a draft timeline. Given that there are 12 weeks, you are expected to mention what you expect to be doing each week. Importantly, after each 4 weeks, you'll have a review / milestone. Make sure it's very clear what your milestones will be.
1. Optional: if you are proposing your own project rather than picking one proposed by the organisation, you'll need to convince the organisation that your idea brings them more value than what they've already proposed. This will require a good understanding of the scope of the organisation and isn't always easy.-->
