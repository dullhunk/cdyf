# Opportunities with W3 Associates Ltd {#w3a}

W3 associates are looking for an AI App Developer to work as a summer intern on a Visual Darts Game, to develop an AI-Based Throwing Technique Analysis App.

* ðŸ“Œ **Project Title** DartVision: AI-Powered Darts Throw Analyzer
* ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**: Develop an AI-based application that captures high-resolution video (4K) of a darts player using a 4K AI enabled camera (client provided), analyzes the throwing technique in real-time or post-processing, and outputs annotated video feedback to help the player improve their form and accuracy.

##  Core Features & Deliverables

The core features required of the app are: 

### Video Input

* Support for 4K camera input (e.g., webcam or phone camera).
* Record short video clips (5â€“10 seconds) of a player throwing darts.

### Pose Detection & Tracking

* Use computer vision (e.g., OpenPose, Mediapipe) to track the playerâ€™s body and arm movement and dart accuracy.
* Key points: shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers.

### Trajectory Estimation

* Optional: Track dart trajectory on camera.
* Estimate release point, angle, speed, board entry point.

### Technique Analysis

* Detect throwing technique metrics such as:
    + Arm extension angle
    + Wrist flick timing
    + Body stability/posture
* Compare against a template (e.g., professional throw) or userâ€™s past
performance

### Feedback Output
* Output annotated video highlighting/troubleshooting:
    + Detected joint movement
    + Deviations from optimal form
* Provide textual or audio suggestions

### User Interface

* Simple UI to record, replay, and analyze throws
* Option to save or export the analysed video
* Basic dashboard showing performance trends over time

### Technical Stack Suggestions
* Language: Python (preferred for prototyping), or JavaScript (if browser-based).
* Libraries/Tools:
    +  OpenCV for video processing.
    +  MediaPipe / OpenPose for pose estimation.
    + TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional for custom ML models).
    +  Streamlit, PyQt, or Electron for UI.
* Hardware: Compatible with 4K cameras (AI enabled camera will be provided).

## Timeline

The timeline for the project is as follows:

* **Week 1:** Research and prototype pose tracking on darts videos
* **Week 2-3:** Build video input + processing pipeline
* **Week 4-5:** Implement technique analysis algorithms
* **Week 6-7:** Add annotated video output and feedback generation
* **Week 6-7:** UI development and integration
* **Week 8:** User testing and performance optimization
* **Week 8:** Final demo and documentation
