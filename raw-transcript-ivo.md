So Welcome. Evo, could you just tell us a little bit about what Tell us? Watch your name on where to come from? I've already introduced you, but who are you? 

> Ivo: So my name is Ivaylo Iliev but just call me Ivo. That's easier for everybody and that's anywhere what everybody calls me and, I am from Bulgaria from [Sofia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia), the Capital, right? And right now I'm a final year students, 


it's gonna graduate in a couple of months Actually in a month. So you just had exams, you're in the middle of exam. So thank you for coming in the middle face and period.

Right. Yeah, exams on the moment. So how many exams you got left? I got only two examples total and I've not done any book, so that's good. I'm yeah, it's not going to be anything too much and I'm kind of calm about everything right now, so it's fine. Good.

So if we can take a step back to the beginning, so why did you decide to come in us or not? Why Manchester, but why computer science what was it about studying computer science that interests. You had it been something from a long time ago or it's it's quite interesting because honestly when I had to choose I had like a year and how before I started uni and I had to kind of choose what I wanted to study.

It was between a lot of things I had business in my because I had been doing a bit of startups back then. A computer science definitely since I was in mathematical high school and a lot of the people over there went to to do computer science or something software engineering related.

And there were a bunch of other things but I think definitely the And the big choice was between business and computer science. And Definitely, the thing that pushed me over a little bit into computer science because that I wanted to get something dangibles and something that I can, I can see some skills that I can.

Um, i can practically practically do and get myself some kind of job that way. So that kind of Applied aspect of it, the kind of vocational exposed aspect of computing. His kind of Part of the interest. Yeah. Definitely and as well since it's It's related to to mathematics definitely.

And I've always had this kind of interest, I mean, I used to be a gamer. I always had interesting computers, how they work, why they do stuff that they do. And, yeah, I was always fascinated by by computers. So that was kind of an addition to all of it.

Okay good. So you arrived here? Two and a half years ago was that after was that after lockdown or was your first year in lockdown or yeah, I thought just It's a little bit of a blurb, Definitely what for me, as well, honestly, because when I arrived in September 2020, it was kind of in the middle of the pandemic or like, it's starred-ish of the pandemic, right?

It was like March, I think it's started, Um, and i went here hopeful that everything is going to be fine and there's not going to be any more lockdowns. And unfortunately, two months later. So I was imaginator just for two months and And then i went back home because there was imposed Lockdown.

And i thought that myself that since everything is online right now, I might as well just do it from home. All right, And so fast forward basically a year and something After that. And I came actually, I came in Manchester honestly quite reasonably just January last year. So 2022, I've had kind of a year and a half here.

Right. Okay. And And so in your i know you you did a summary internship in was that the end of your first year at the end of your second year. It was the end of my second year it summer between second and third year so last summer basically, right?

So and did you have, did you do anything in the summer of first year, where you just you would just at home. So I really try doing a couple of things. So first, I was part of I became part of a society game development Society that we were working on a game.

And I wanted to kind of extend that into the summer, right? And also, the other thing that i'm i was searching for internships on honestly. Well, I couldn't land one. I was very ill-informed and didn't put too much effort into it but eventually I got kind of not a role but I was helping some like a startup as a voluntary work.

But both this and again development society kind of they did in didn't continue through the whole summer They kind of fell apart. So basically my first summer between first and second year it was like but of hanger because I didn't I wasn't really able to get any serious internship and any real work done, right?

Okay. So you came back in to second year, I'm usually done sort of bits and pieces in the summer. That was in Bulgaria. I guess was it? Um, so that was for a UK startup and for those society that's in the university. So I try to direct myself you next or the game dev part of Unix or game deaf part of unique i think, right?

It was yeah. Okay. So, Then in your beginning of second year, I guess you kind of did that make you think actually, I do want to get a summer internship next summer. And then, did you start looking in September? Or how did that work out in your second year?

So it was, it was Kind of kind of mixed because I definitely wanted to get an internship. But at the same time, I I didn't really have the the capacity especially the start of second year then have the capacity to Um, To get my applications done and look for companies kind of And, So there's a result of all that was that I came here in like January and I had to study for exams and at the same time it was high time that I start applying and start looking for companies and positions.

I mean, looking back now, I think that was very late doing that but still I Yeah, i did my exams and then after that immediately, I focused on. Well, sometimes you to advertise a bit later in the year so if you would have been looking for a placement sometimes these get advertised the beginning of the academically are September but sometimes somewhere internships sometimes get advertised a little bit later Is that whereas I've been your experience or would you think you would have been better applying for summer internships?

From September rather than you started in January. I mean i'll definitely prefer to how started in. Let's say September, but I think for me from what I've seen, it's more about, I guess, definitely for for placements, people want to get it out of the way, like companies want to get it out of the way sooner rather than later.

While summer internships is a different thing, but I've seen that, I mean Yeah, banks definitely want to get out all of the internships. And finish finish with we selecting candidates until like December. Let's say, so I had virtually not chances for for banks, right? Okay, I'm so, So you mentioned sort of.

So one choice of students faces like should I do a submer internship? Or should I do a young placement? And so I was interested to know like why did you choose somewhere internship rather than a year long placement? So the deciding factor for me because I had an offer for a placement and for somewhere internship, I had to office and the deciding factor for me, wasn't what I wanted to do, one of the other.

But rather their companies that and the positions that I was That was selected for, right? Um, so yeah, definitely I was open to both of them. I thought that it will be good because obviously you and in a placement, you do get a whole year of experience, but Um, at the same time, if you don't get a placement then, By the time people finish their placement.

You already graduated so that you can start a graduate role. Yes, yeah. It's quite I guess it's quicker, right? So you graduated sooner. You don't pay fees for that. You probably. I think, I don't know if it's a factory in your case, but I know some students say that's a factors like well, I don't want to pay feats for that.

That. Yeah, university, even though you're not really at university, you're part of the university. And so, which organisation, we you employed by So, because we haven't actually mentioned this. Yeah, yeah. That's yeah. Mmm. I went to to work in Amazon, Web Services and there London office. It so remote or in person entirely in person or bit.

Both it was honestly a bit of both but I really, really wanted to be in person for the whole time. And i think this was a great decision because I found out to that, it brings you a lot of value to actually go into office, meet people and like, make this sort of connections.

I think, especially Early on in your career definitely, I would say that I think once you become a stablished it's kind of easier to work remotely by. I think at the beginning, Is that those kinds of social interactions and Some help has more important than they are later on.

Because you're looking for. Mentors and guidance and learning from people who've. Done, you know, done this sort of for years. Um, so It. So what was your role at amazon web services? So this actually came up as a question in In the because you came to the presentation to.

Yeah. First years about this And someone said, what's a solution's architect? And I don't think we actually had time to answer the question, but what is a you were a solution's architect. Yeah. What architect too? Because that's kind of some people that mean that name means nothing When I gonna go idea what it is, but what does a solution's architect do?

Well, I don't blame them because the first time I saw the base sent me the test for the, for the position. I was like, oh, why did I apply to this? And then I read the description. I was like, okay, that's sounds interesting. But yeah, basically solutions architect is a role which entails many different responsibility.

So, on one side, the way they explained it to me, and I've found it is on one side. You have to be very capable of Knowing the services that they providing in terms of clouds. And the way the services can interact with one another and kind of being able to look at an application.

Let's say that has been deployed on premises, So on servers in in-house and then being able to kind of transform it into a bunch of services in In AWS, which are linked together and have creating those sorts of solutions. Um as well as I guess understanding this security, part of things, the how costly it's going to be for the client kind of thinking about about all of these things as well.

And so were you talking to clients? Who was that done by somebody else in the organisation, you were kind of there as a kind of Somebody some come speak to internally or was it something where you'd actually gun? Meet customers yourself. So my particular role was Very much like the technical part was 50% of the work, The other 50% of the work was actually talking to engineers talking to executive sometimes and just giving them advice on how They could better understand the cloud and better make use of the cloud in order to kind of In order to fulfil their business needs and business goals, right?

Okay. So the kind of business stuff is kind of, I guess because you mentioned, you're interested in that. So some some computer scientists Very interested in business at all, but I guess you kind of Were perhaps more more than Some students I know who kind of don't really care about the business side of things, You kind of you enjoyed that aspect of it as well as the technical side, right?

Most definitely, I think that's a way better role is way way more student for me as somebody who has had experience actually talking to Like being a founder myself for first. Um doing startups and then not only that, but also talking to different kinds of people. I'm used to doing that.

I am, I'm very much enjoying that. I wouldn't be able. I quickly realise while I was doing this internship and chatting with friends about what they're doing in their software engineering internships that It's definitely not for me to sit. The hopeful the whole day and just write code. It's Definitely, I'm way more enjoyable process for me to know the technical side of things, how they work, and why they work.

But also being able to communicate that on a daily basis with other people And actually doing both. I can give you that variety, right? Because you're not just talking to customers the whole time. You're also, then, I guess implementing things or kind of hearing stuff out the, you know, what, how the services works you must have learnt a lot about some very complex ecosystem of services, on Amazon web services, and just learning about that, you know, You could spend years learning that stuff.

Can you Definitely? Yeah. So, He talked about this in your talk a little bit. But what were the main obstacles you faced and finding employment and how did you overcome them? I mean, one thing you mentioned there was perhaps not being informed as well as you could have been in the process.

So how did you overcome that in? In your job, search. So and my job search. I mean, definitely the The advice that that you gave us in first and second, you're like, throughout the years, I have kind of remembered some of the stuff that sometimes you, you tell us like a quick tip.

Oh, you can use this website to, to find jobs or whatever. But yeah, definitely. These these pieces of advice. I came back to them and I'm really, really helped me get through all of all of this because at the beginning you just sitting along in your room and you're like, I know I have done some stuff, but how does that transform into the real world and who would be able to give them money for that, right?

So it's definitely, it's definitely a lengthy process, and it's not only a process of A searching within, let's say LinkedIn or Google grad cracker for jobs, but it's also searching within yourself, and I think that's kind of been underestimated. On that, you need to kind of think about Um, What exactly do I want to do?

I want to do like what do I want my work to kind of look like or feel like A based on different things that you've done before. So for me as I said already, I had done were communicating with people at that point in time. I had also been doing presentation skills training so I knew that I had to do some communication right?

But then as well I I'm studying computer science and I love computers and technology So I knew that it had to do something with technology as well. So, I was applying to, I mean, the standard software engineering positions because I, you want to take these expectations of the job, but also want to get something realistic on the other side.

So, I applied to all the software engineering positions, but I also apply to many product manager positions, right? Or like, internships, placements, because they've been popping around quite a lot recently. And, and also sorts of like technical. But also communication. Communication type of roles. And even though I didn't get selected for any of the lightsaber project manager like project or product management roles I feel like, That was a good opportunity for me to to kind of explore Because honestly, The the thing is that it could the solutions architect position.

That I, as I told you, I don't know why I applied to it. At first, You probably take to box somewhere without realising. It was basically, I just went on the Amazon website and everything that that spoke technology to me, I just signed up for that. Yeah. Okay, so if I would have kept only to software developer and software engineer, which a lot of people do, I wouldn't definitely missed a very, very good opportunity.

He's just kind of interesting is that there are lots of roles beside software, engineering People think, and software engineering, because that's the most obvious route. But you mentioned, Product manager there. I mean you weren't successful and getting the product manager jobs but what is a product manager? Moto is a product manager, do typically As a role.

Well. As far as yeah, as far as I'm aware, it's I've done it only on a like an art hog basis and like, My own projects but it's it's more about coordinating different parties in the Um, in a soft like in a technological project, It's more about, not not writing cold, but rather understanding how let's say, people who do the cold work, how the other other side?

Let's say the investors or Um all the executive side of things, how like the stakeholders, how how they, like what they expect and kind of blinking linking, all of those together. Understand what, what's going to be part of the product. You will service that you're building and what's not what it's going to do.

So defining What it is? That the team is building. It wasn't what? Yeah, it's about thinking about the wider picture, the bigger picture, that's something that I've found myself. Okay good. So I mean, you mentioned, you mentioned you've been applying to software engineering position. So What was your experience of coding interviews?

How did you find? Did you find those? Okay, where they difficult? I was there any particular challenges there? Well, I was kind of lucky to have some experiencing coding because I started even like at the beginning of high school, I started doing competitive programming like, courses at that's cool.

So I already had Not sort of Olympia ads that kind of thing. Yes, yes in C++ so I had this kind of Fundamentals that I could step on and really And yeah, really, really go on from there. So for example, data structures, algorithms, let's say more than half of these things I already knew.

Um, but yeah, that that helped me monthly in the in the interviewing process because it wasn't because I mean, a lot of people they they do lead called and then they start from from zero and it's definitely a hard process But for me, it was more like kind of reminding myself of the the things that are kind of already knew as well as learning bit more stuff.

And then, Um that's why most of the coding into views like the first coding interviews. I didn't find let's say the doing parts difficult. So kind of thinking about how to like what algorithm you need to use. I guess that the thing I found a little bit harder is the analysis of that afterwards.

So let's say time completing terms of time complex, the in terms of space complexity, Uh but do the good thing about it was that courses in computer science at Union of Manchester do provide you I feel like with A bit of background about about those as well, so that you are able to figure that out, But those kind of skills, how useful those kind of skills in Being a solution is architect, was that important, was it kind of knowing about, you know, space and time complexity of algorithms, I'm guessing wasn't so important as a solution to architect.

I don't know. Yeah, that that's what people. People ask me all the time. Did you have according interview? And I'm like, no, I didn't have according into view. It was networks that I got asked about. And yeah, it didn't ask me any cooling questions. So it's based complexity time complex.

He never came up in the application process or the job. Open to now, right? Okay, I'm gonna guess with that. Be different if you'd applied for pure engineering roles Amazon. If you're apply for a pear software, engineering role definitely like you'd be hammered. Was those consequent questions? Oh yeah, you'll definitely be.

Yeah, it doesn't be as you said hammered by but it's questions and you'd be expected to perform very well on those Right. Okay good. Um so what for you? I mean you sort of talk to a little bit about this. What do you think? Were the main things that you learn by your through your summer internship?

What the things that you felt that you took away So, to give a little bit of context, I had come from a background that was basically more way more related to Startups and small companies, and I have kind of immersed myself into that kind of field. And the internship at a big corporation, like Amazon gave me the opportunity to see how a big body works and wide works and what they do.

Exactly. So this is this was I think one of the most useful things I mean, along the The usual cloud and services knowledge. Right that they inevitably teach you. But yeah, kind of looking at a wider organisation and and what processes need to be in place And it is, it is quite different from from a startup, I came with a lot of presumptions that The other things was happening that way would be way more way, more fast and then you are faced with all of these processes that Lengthy processes that all you need to, I don't know.

Um, you need to To arrange a meeting with this kind of person. Oh well they're very busy all of the time. So yeah, they say yeah, sure. I'll schedule a meeting with you in three weeks and I'm like, I'm pretty tomorrow. So, it's kind of a It's kind of a different different environment but at the same time, it was extremely Um, inspiring to see.

Um in does she such a successful organisation? Because the first thing I notice about everything and the thing I always help people and they when they ask me how was the work? How other people. I'm, like, the people over there, all of them have most of the qualities, I would search for, in a co-founder, If I had to make my own starter, And that's amazing because you usually it would be extremely hard of find those kinds of people but Um, Yeah, definitely.

There are very skilled. But also there are very Um, they're very communicative. Um, and There, let's say they're very open to feedback so they're not necessarily Because you sometimes people get, you know you hear the phrase corporate like people described as well. That's a corporate person but actually it sounds like within the people you came into contact with or more.

I don't like this word but it's quite a good word. People talk about entrepreneurs. Yeah so you have an entrepreneurial mindset but you're working inside this massive organisation global organisation But u as an individual behave, perhaps a bit more like you've done. As. A co-founder or somebody in a starter.

Definitely my my project over there. The funny thing about it was that and Was that they just gave me like a random, Not random, but a very broad topic, right? To, to look at And, So it was basically related that they told me what can we do in terms of sustainability.

Lower something like that. Let's say with kind of a little bit more details but kind very, very much as broad as this And so they kind of put me in this pool of Of limitless, limitless, directions and ideas where they left me kind of alone that and they wanted to see how Um, how i was becoming in that sort of environment, what I would do.

And the thing that they really, they're really liked about me throughout the whole internship, is that I was able to just like an entrepreneur to have something. That's very, very vague, very broad and kind of get on with it, take responsibility and ownership for it and kind of arrive.

So, you mentioned that where that word only ships were interesting because I think isn't that, is that one of the Amazon principles? I'm net worth every anyone. I know who works has worked out Amazon or does work at Amazon before too long. They tell me about Amazon principles and I know ownership is one of the.

Is it 10 11 principles of Amazon? Yeah, yeah they actually and then not just sort of principles that they write down on paper and say yeah. And then forget about they do actually Take them quite seriously in my experience is that is definitely definitely. I was quite surprised because, yeah, I saw them and I knew that they like HR would ask me on those but I was quite surprised to learn.

For example, after I did the technical part of the interviewing process. So I did like a test and then we had this sort of interview where they'll just ask me about different technical topics And after that, they told me, oh you've managed to go to the final round and there's two interviews and out of the two interviews like 70, 80% of the time, we were not talking about anything technical.

It was all about the leadership principles, right? Oh my god, like they really? They really value those And when you get into the company, you realise that I think even it's documented, which leadership principle is your your best that and then which one you can you can improve on but they take it really seriously.

And I guess has been part of sort of promotion as well. They probably people based on those principles, not just definitely take them into account, really, really seriously. And then the funny thing is, as well that a lot of the people there and I kind of started doing these maybe maybe recognise it from there.

It's just in their speech. They regularly include those kinds of leadership principles. They reference back to them. Um, sold that we are all like, we're all bursting out ideas but they're tightly put together. Um, so that we can put them into the context that we are. We are right, okay, good, right, That's interesting.

And so, Learning source of operating a big corporations, probably. An interesting experience. And And I'm going to the question here is so what was what was the most enjoyable or rewarding part of that in terms of Your day-to-day work. What would you say was the most rewarding part of it?

So in my, in my opinion it was again a link back. So one part of it was Linking back to the people over there, and that is very enjoyable to work with them. I Three because, you know, throughout work, you can you can encounter some people that let's say, are not that open to Um sharing ideas or create or you cricketing there ideas, receiving feedback, kind of, kind of stuff like that while in Amazon at least my experience, it was very rewarding.

Um, to To to be kind of working with those kinds of people. By the way, it has to have to make this claim that everything that I say, right now is my own opinion and not of the of that journey. Okay? I just have to say that, that's right, so good.

So fast forward then. You finish yourself, my attention should become back to university. And you have a final year project, you tell us a little bit about what your finally project was and what you did. So my final, we are projects. Was related to. Um, the smart grid. So this is basically a concept of the electrical grid that we currently have.

But Um kind of modernising it and allowing free floor, kind of information and making it more efficient basically. So in that kind of system, And they're sold the way, like a lot of, a lot of algorithms already developed to battle, this kind of efficiency of electricity used. And I was working on the encryption part of it like, privacy preserving.

Which kind of makes it way more practical in a real environment because, you know, in the environment, everybody wants to know everybody, but there are some people that wanna still information, use it for malicious purposes and that's what we were kind of battling. Right. Okay. And there was this project, you're proposed yourself for.

Is it something that you pick from the book? It was something that I did pick. It was a project that my supervisor. It was just supervising. It was the final stuff are. Okay, right. Yeah. So it was quite quite fun working with him and I think it was quite quite interesting and interesting project to me, Good?

All right. And then, the last bit of this is so your graduating in a month's time. A bit more than the months time. Yeah. When it's graduation July, there's something. Yeah. 17. Anyway, so you what comes next? I mean, once you've had a break and recovered from exams, What comes next?

So the thing that's surely happening is I'm going to be returning to AWS. And continuing then there in their like graduate program but it's actually like just a full-time roll. So is that like is that just sort of continuing what you did before or is it like a thing where you do a rotation and you work in different parts of the organisation just have that graduate programs.

It's what they call the thick u program. Which means first six months, you are just studying about about the cloud and And communicating with clients and then after the. So after this kind of training, six months then tech you as in you Of you person or you university or I guess I guess that's all they call it.

I have. Yeah that before so tech you. Yeah, that's what they call it. I mean, I recommended to anybody that has interest in cloud And then so after these six months of training, then you go on to be integrated into an actual team that you just start full time work, right?

And I'll be in London again, I guess. Yes. That will be in London. But yeah, that's the kind of more. Let's see form or part of it, that the work work part of it while. Um yeah i'll be i mean i'm constantly working on side projects. I'm thinking of more doing more kind of lecturing and speaking in the future.

So, so does that's A lot of exciting things going on her head. Yeah no thanks to all the time but I thought I'd like to thank you again for the record. Thank you for coming in talking to first year because that was one of the It's quite difficult to find speak as you can engage with the audience, right?

You can find people to come and talk about their organisation, that's not very hard. What's difficult is finding somebody can talk technology to be about an organisation but also in gauge with the audience and one thing I haven't at the end of viewers and you had got some pictures of it.

Maybe put them on this is Big cute people coming into after. That's that's my measure of Has a talk been successful? If lots of people come up with the end of talk to you, then you know you winning Basically. So thanks for doing that. That was a really good talk.

Yeah, I think definitely there is a need for for students because we have a lot of like we have ever more information available to us. Um, ever more. Opportunities to choose from. And at the same time, it's it's a matter of Um gen z like the new generator like, I mean now it's not as new over generation but The generation I'm in, I I have seen studies and I have seen for myself as well that we are, definitely not ready for this kind of information to be able to kind of crunch it and make a choice.

And that's what I find. Most people struggle with is That we are supposed to be more independent than ever in terms of making our own choices. But, What I've seen is studies is that people are even more getting used to, let's say leave home later, like they rely on their parents way more in terms of financials in terms of way to live, but also in terms of like emotional support and kind of this decision making So long story shorts people.

Don't want to make like, don't want to make choices. But they have to make a lot of choices right now. Even and every morning I it's an American expression but the fire hose people talk about the fire hose as just this kind of fire hose of information blasting at you about.

Opportunities that there are things that you could do and it's you know it's like you're saying you searching inside yourself as well as searching inside the fire hose is is it's a big challenge. I think for most people. It's definitely like an enormous challenge and that's that's the reason why I did.

I think I told you this story about how I decided, Did I tell you how I decided to do. Okay, so I was just having coffee and cake with a friend of mine, We go out. I'm probably once a month or so. And he's a good friend of mine and we were talking about just life in general.

And, He he told me. Oh well, you're you're done with you. Don't for life like you got a job at Amazon because you're like, so sort smart and a genius. And I'm like No, I am definitely not. I mean smart maybe but definitely I'm not definitely a genius. I'm not any better.

In terms of, let's take technical skills than the other people. It's just that I knew what to do or found out how to do stuff, so that I can get us a significant advantage over everybody else. And then It was like, oh really and then I looked at his CV and he had because he was studying, he studying biomed, I think or like neuroscience stuff like that.

And he had like work with the professor in the lab and essays and high scores. And I was like, how are you not getting a job? And then he showed me like the formal. I see, I was like, okay, that's why And then immediately, after I went home, I remember I just wrote a one-pageer and I said it to you.

I was like, Take a look at that, I'm coming to more to discuss it Because I knew that there are a lot of people that have the qualities but they don't know how to go about stuff. And so I have how to while articulate it in a way all and knowing which it's knowing which bits to articulate as well.

Like what bits of relevant, what bits are in is in a potential employer, gonna be interested in because some of what you've done. Isn't that interesting? I mean, it might be interesting to you, but it's might not. Is it less interesting to other thing other people? But then the flip side of that is the stuff you've done.

Like it's biomet guy you're talking about is he doesn't realise the value of what he's done because he's kind of inside the buried in his CV somewhere else on page two or it's not on there at all. Like actually you need to give that a lot more emphasis because that's really interesting That's that's that says something about you as a person that Play will actually care about.

Yeah, i just i just think that students nowadays And I used to be like that as well. They think that if you want to get the good job or a job, or a great job that you have to be smart or a genius. All right? And that's just like 50, even maybe like 50 less than 50% of the whole work.

And yeah, the other 50% is like thinking about where are you gonna apply? How are you gonna apply? What are you gonna say on your interview? Like on your senior as well? So it's all about those kind of little things, but they They make the difference. Really they did for me.

Good, that's good here. So I hope you enjoy your your job at Amazon when you start when you continue there. So we'll move on to the. We've got a few sort of standard questions here that I ask all the guess The first one is And this one's called you are the next five chancellor.

So, the vice chancellor of the University of Manchester is has been serving since What is it 2010? So after a good few years, a service, she stepping down. I want you to imagine that. You are now the vice. You have responsibility for 11,000 staff, and 40,000 students, and a network of half a million alumni around the world.

Know what you're going to do, what what would be the sort of things that you do as a vice chancellor? Whoo that that's quite quite a big responsibility. Definitely. Um, I guess the things that I would first start to focus on as the things. I wish we've just talked about is just kind of Kind of helping students gain that confidence and again, access to the Of useful sort of resources.

So instead of Because i mean already, everybody has access to let's say job boards and lead code and hacker rank, so they still learn how to code. Um, but do things that they don't really have access to right now is, as you said people that have already gone through the process, That can speak from experience.

Um, employers that Um, not only tell stuff about their company but how they actually went about, let's say, getting the job or how they think students should go about that about about the whole process. I think In, in an age of so much information. There should be. More. I mean, i don't want to see fours that divides but things that students need to go through.

And talking with like let's say pass. I'm not only past one past two. Um, And also one-to-one consultations with With students or people are like recent graduates. I think it's really like it's the first thing that I'm gonna go about an establish, It kind of sounds naf when you say because it's like people talk about networking but that's kind of what you talking about in a ways.

It's like just kind of meeting people who are different stages in their career because they can all help you. And and most people are actually quite willing to help. Yeah, people definitely. Yeah. All I've realised that in, Yeah, you have to ask, right? And exactly, no shame in asking because the worst that can happen is that they could say no, sorry kind of thing.

Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Someone else. Yeah, most of the good opportunities that I've had. In my life have been through. Oh, just kind of Looking looking at people and then saying, oh, I think this person might be very, very useful to me. And then the other thing is people people Kind of have these idea in there heads that they they have to look for the opportunity.

So they they have to Um, They have to kind of imagine the perfect opportunity and then if they see it, they grab it while. It might experience. I've seen that just exposing yourself and kind of putting yourself out there. A not. It's looking or searching for specific thing. Yeah.

Neurologists throwing yourself and seeing what comes out of it. Yeah, I mean, it's reading a commencement speech, you know, American graduations. They have these comments beers where they get a big, you know, big wig in to come and do a talk. So it's reading one from Bill Gates He was talking at.

Nash Northern Arizona University One things he was saying is that You know, you don't have to worry about the first step, right? Because your, your life is, you know, that first step is the first act, right? So you kind of you're not going to be doing that for the rest of your life.

So, You don't need to worry too much whether that first step is right for you. So much is just try out and see where it goes. Yeah. Was that can happen. Is that you decide? Okay, that's not for me. I'll try something else. Something Hmm yeah yeah definitely And I don't know I anecdotely I see that quality students works like making that first step is a bit scary because it feels like well.

You know, if you're going to banking says like, well I not sure if I want to work in banking for the rest of my life kind of thing but you know there's no such thing as a job for life anymore. So you know, Try and see what you think of it.

Yeah, so kind of yeah, kind of as a, as a sum up of all this as a voucher, that I would definitely create opportunities for people to do some networking and kind of just I mean sort of online networking or face to face or a bit of both. I mean, I guess a bit of both but I would prefer face to face because I think thats where it most naturally develops and yeah, kind of giving students that opportunity to By chance meet people and discover, oh, they're doing something.

I'm very interested in. That's contact them, and we can, we can make something out of it. Yeah. Okay, good. Anything else is Vice Chancellor? I mean, I sort of networking. I think, quite important. But anything else. Hmm, I guess maybe a little bit more funding towards volleyball without a personal thing.

Is there a volleyball? So there are volleyball club a part of the students union or yeah. Yeah but like there are quite a few and you are part of that yeah I am I I've been playing for for a year now. But yeah, i feel like some sports. Let's say that some sports, get more priority over others and I feel like and some universities are sportier than others as well.

Definitely in the UK, you know, places like Loughborough and bath and places like that are very sporty universities. Have very You know, amazing sporting facilities, I mean yeah you've had good facilities here in Manchester nor what? Yeah, and I think there is a lot of potential in a lot of the sports because I mean Love Browser is a sports school but we almost beat them at volleyballs, right?

Good. Okay. So, the next one is more of a personal one. This is called one tune one podcast. One film. I'm send, you've got a book as where you want to recommend that. We can. Yes, in there. So definitely. Um, One, can you recommend us a tune that you'd Something that has to makes you relax all whatever at something?

And tell us a little bit about why this why this tune is important to you and we'll add it to our coders playlist or right? That's good. I mean yeah, I thought about this question because I listen to a lot of music. I think last statistics Spotify said, I listened like 10 or 15% of my life last year had been music by yeah, yeah, on my life including sleep.

So Subscriptions worth it. Oh very much. Very much. But yeah. Yeah, so I wanted to come up with Or like remind myself of something that It. It's, it's like everybody can kind of relate to that. So, what I picked is song called, it's a very famous song called Hall of Fame.

By description will. I am And basically, I play, whenever I feel down or I feel that stuff isn't happening right now. And then it kind of brings you back that I'm kind of energy to keep moving forward because things are going to be. Alright. And then just keep looking, keep, keep your eyes on the prize, basically and just keep working in you.

You get what you? Okay, so we'll put that on the code display list. The next one is a podcast. You listen at podcasts much. I listened to very few ones but I Yeah, I do. I do definitely have a recommendation for podcast. I just listened And this week. Yeah i just listened the legs friedman podcast right with some old man.

The CEO of Open AI. Is that? So something, it's an AI podcast. I was later. Is it a technology podcast? It's It's none of like it's it's neither it's a podcast where Basically interesting people go on the and talk about very meaningful topics. So let's say, Jordan bit or something has been on the Um and it's not only about, it's not only about like propagate like propaganda and talking about the things that they just do.

But I think let's the ability to really, really reason with them and I'm provides a lot of, a lot of perspectives. And I think that like, that's why I would recommend to everybody because there's always called the Lex Friedman podcast or is it, does it have a name? What, what do people search for in their podcast?

Well, if you search for Lex Friedman, you find you're definitely find it. What? Now the name rings about but I can't think from. Yes, he's had blessed women podcast. Yeah, he's had guess like some altman. The open name, AI CEO. Yeah, there's also magnus cars and the chest player Um, Mr.

Beast of youtube. All right, Chris walls. So there are a lot of A lot of different. Get interesting, right? And then one, one film, I didn't know if you were a big film buff but it's a particular film that you think we should go and watch right now. Um, old or new.

It doesn't have to be something But I think, yeah, I want one movie that really stuck with me, but I don't, I mean this game, I don't watch a lot of movies, but And sometimes I do And those who are really good, they stuck in my head. And so, the one I'm I would really recommend is interstellar.

I know that a lot of people have watched it, it's quite popular. But i still feel like I can watch it again and again and still find Um, next deal reason about different things, right? One of the most Let's say. I guess important, let's inspiring things about about it all is No spoilers.

It's fine. It's when when different characters have different sense of time. So let's say they go to some planet then they come back and they've been there for like 12 hours but it's been let's say 20 years on the on the ship, right? So it's kind of thinking about the The idea of time and how fast it may goals sometimes.

Because when I look back, now, I'm like, when did I start uni? Like it's it's gone so so fast. Yes. Yeah, it does. So, this kind of, it's kind of idea about time, really? Most, we'll come back to time travel in a minute and our next question. But, and then there's a book you wanted to add to this list as well.

Yeah, definitely. We talked about this before we started the podcast, but that people don't really read a lot nowadays, right? Not books. Anytime anyway. But I think I'm a big advocate of reading books. And when you say books, you don't mean Kindle. You mean an actual paper book like a novel or, or you're not first on the format that you read it in?

I'm not too first. I, yeah, I have right now, I have a book halfway through my, on my Kindle, I have a lot of books that i'm halfway through like physical books but I also have audiobooks right? So different. Yeah, for me it's it's kind of weird. What a book is anymore.

Yeah. About. But yeah, that the one I would really recommend is one of the first, the first books I read It's It's called the seven habits of highly effectively. Okay. And this is this, that's quite an old book, isn't it? That's been around for a long time, I think.

Oh yeah, definitely. Yeah. I think it was. Yeah, it's been around for I think, yeah, at least 20 years, right? Not more, but it's one of those kind of classics that, I mean, not, it's what you call it. No non-fiction nonfiction. Yeah, exactly. But it's it's this kind of classics in nonfiction that you can always read and you can you can always find Um, some some A lot of.

Like something to learn from it and and it's absolutely fundamental I think for everybody that's just starting live and they want to Do life, right? If you can do that. But yeah, it's it's you can apply to various situations and It's it's really useful good. Okay. That's how that brings us to our last question, which is time travelling.

I mentioned interstellar time travel so I kind of want to I've got a time travel machine here and you're going to step on that time machine going to go back to meet yourself. In first year, arriving here, in Manchester from Bulgaria. What would you tell yourself something that you've learnt while you've been here that you, perhaps wish you known when you started.

Um, so not just for you but perhaps. All students. Well because i mean personally for me I would say never go back for let's say, a year and a half. I think for a year backing Bulgaria. Just stay there because you're gonna learn a lot of stuff here. It's going to be useful experience But for I guess something that could be you used in a while variety of contacts.

Is mainly to to give yourself chances, give yourself more chances and don't be too fixated on on marks. Because I used to do that a lot, especially in first year, I mean, it's kind of natural I was very ambitious and wanted to Really. A hammer on the grades. I wanted it like, 80 plus, but as I as I went through the university life, I found out that It's not actually the marks that matter.

It doesn't matter as much, what do you have on your diploma? But it's more like what you know and what you can do and the opportunities that you have here kind of, I would want to throw myself a little bit more into into the opportunities. Because uni computer science it.

You need Manchester especially it gets tough. In year two and then it doesn't get easier after that. So there's definitely a lot of pressure on your at all times but It's a sort of bit of a culture change because in school you're just you know the classic thing is you're told it's work hard and get good grades.

And that's that determines what universities you can apply to and you're either university. I think it's like it's almost like an algorithm people carry on while. I got the best grades I could at schools, so our carry on doing that university and actually university. It doesn't matter so much.

I mean, it's you need to do the best you can but like you say it's important to kind of Engage with all the other stuff that's going around. You besides the, just got to get good marks, got to get good marks, Definitely well, especially especially in In computer science, because I, The at this point you don't even like, sometimes you don't even need a diploma, like I have a friend of mine.

Who we studied together in high school. And then he like, we both went to university, but he did his own, like, he started hit on his own startup and he's my, my age. Now, having a company like a major sharing a company that he found that, that is valued to millions of dollars right now.

So there's this path as well. So I mean, I'm not saying a quick university, definitely. It's a good idea to to have to keep on studying, but there are also sorts of opportunities. It's about kind of It's not about. Just getting the good marks. And but it's about. It's about studying and learning stuff, and then thinking about, okay, what I want to do next, If I want to do a master's, it then PhD maybe having good marks is very much linked to me having A very, very good knowledge of the fields, then maybe go for marks, but It's think about what you really want to do because not a lot of people go into academia and that's for a reason.

So no, I mean it's it's just one thing that you can do. Yeah. It's not that you have to do this. Yeah. And it's not even a big thing. It's, I mean yeah, it's a good thing. If you want to do it but then if you don't want to do it and you didn't try to do it, it's gonna be a nightmare on honestly.

Yeah. Okay, good. Okay, okay. I think on that coast will will finish up so thank you Evo for coming on the show and Good luck with whatever comes next. Well good, let with moving to London and carrying on with AWS. Yeah. And thanks again for joining us. Yeah. Thank you.
