DUNCAN: So welcome Jason. Thank you for joining the show. And I wanted to talk to you a little bit about what your journey's been from before. You start studying here to now four years later, there's a lot has happened in the last four years and tell us a little bit about how you came to study computer science and, you know, all that stuff. So can you tell us a little bit back yourself and where you from? And originally, where you studied, where you studied before you came to Manchester?


JASON: Yeah, so yeah, London London, through and through born and raises in London, living on the whole life, obviously ethnically. I'm Nigerian. So, with my parents you know, were born and studied in Nigeria moving over here later and, yeah, I guess in terms of locations in London, I'm, you know, from East London. So it's like my main stomping ground. And yeah, I guess I'll talk about how I got into computer science.

DUNCAN: yeah, yeah.

JASON: I'd say the main way computers are kind of is a weird one and I tell people the story, they don't really believe me, but actually don't really have much of an interesting could be a science and school, I got to sixth form so I'm essentially


DUNCAN: Did do it (computer science) as an A level

JASON: I'll get to that. That's part of the story. So I did, I did computer science and economics at GCSE those two that I chose. And essentially I really liked economics. I found it really interesting. And yeah, like I wanted to take that further. I was kind of a finance bro' so to speak. I was really interested. I wanted to see, you know, where I could take it, but the problem was that when GCSEs were done, there were  some issues with the teacher, our teacher, teaching us wrong parts of the spec and stuff like that. Essentially the grade I got in the, in the final GCSE exam was, was lower than what I needed for the sixth form. I would eventually be moving to off the back of those grades, if that makes sense. So my plan was kind of to get my GCSE and to move to like a like a more, a better six form. So I could get better education for A levels but the problem is that due to, you know, issues of the teaching and whatnot, the grade wasn't as high as it needed to be for me to take that subject at a level at the sixth form.


DUNCAN: Right

JASON: So you know, originally I wanted to do physics, maths and economics, you know I was planning on, you know, going down the finance route. Yeah, but yeah, they wouldn't let me do it. So I thought okay what's the next best thing or something? I enjoy and something I found pretty you know, easy at GCSE was computer science. I found I liked it, I enjoyed it. I found it pretty straightforward. I got, I think I got one of the highest marks in my year, for computer science, actually see. So, you know, that's pretty confident, I could, you know, do it and, you know, it makes sense.

DUNCAN: So, you did physics, maths and computer science.

JASON Exactly. So I started that and yeah, that's really enjoy that. I agree. I agree to really love it. You know I got sided, you know, picking up getting prop learning how to code properly because, you know, the code you do at GCSE is very rudimentary and yeah, that kind of took me to university. I discovered computers. That's kind of came to me. It's kind of, by chance because if my sixth form had allowed me to do economics, I don't think I'll be here today. So yeah, it's pretty crazy, pretty crazy, but yeah, so yeah, I mean

DUNCAN: So it's doing A level made, you think, actually, this is an interesting subject I like to do. I'd like to take further than just,


JASON: exactly, exactly exactly.

DUNCAN: Okay, interesting. So, and then so your story your arrived here, four years ago, you've done a three-year bachelor's degree with a year in industry. So can you tell us a little bit about that journey? I think you you did a placement at Morgan Stanley, wasn't it initially? You started looking for that beginning of your second year. So you tell us a little bit about how you found the job and that whole process.

JASON: Yeah. Essentially was just a ton of applications. I mean, I think the main thing for me, I wanted to keep my horizons pretty broad. I wanted to make sure I didn't limit myself to just tech companies or limit myself to any kind of like niche. So and I always found finance pretty interesting how that mentioned before, you know, I always had that always had that prior finance interest. So essentially I was applying for you know, traditional tech companies, always investment banks and yeah, after a bunch of applications I was able to get to, you know, the final round, the assessment centre of Morgan Stanley managed to smash that and then you know, got called in to do the placement. So that was yeah scheduled to be a year but obviously was caught a month short because of COVID. You know it's funny because I literally started in the middle of COVID that place, right?

DUNCAN: So that was all online. I guess.

JASON: Exactly. Exactly

DUNCAN: Were you in London or Manchester

JASON:  I'm back and forth. I mean coming up here, see some friends, do some work, why not? And yeah, so I only go to go into the office in the last, maybe two months of the placements, right? It was a bit, not ideal, but, I mean, you know, life gives you lemons, you make lemonade right? So, just took it for it was, and still managed have a really great experience of the back of it.

DUNCAN: Did, you do a rotation? Did you do two six months? Yeah. Yeah.


JASON: I spent six months with the equity derivatives team, so that's working on like, I mean, not to get too jargony but essentially derivatives are like a type of financial product and I was with the equity derivative team, so like traditional like stocks and options and whatnot. So I was working on technology. That would essentially basically automate the process of passing, you know, requests for different financial products coming into the firm. So it was kind of like a year, like an NLP (Natural Language Processing) type project where clients will be able to kind of use chat system that Morgan Stanley had available and then some automated parsing would be applied to their messages to basically determine like what product they want. Yeah. So that was the first rotation and the second rotation was with the FX flow team.

DUNCAN:  So that's foreign exchange for forex.

JASON: Forex essentially. So. Yeah, working like the currency, the currency exchange system systems and stuff like that. So yeah. I was able to learn, you know, a lot on both sides. I think the first one, the first rotation was kind of like a research. You type project what else kind of doing you know, some AI  type stuff. Second rotation was more of a this traditional softeng role, I was kind of clearing out tickets. You know, just helping out of different bits and bobs, didn't really do anything, but specifically, I kind of just part of the software engineering team and this helped out and then, yeah, I guess after my placement actually.

DUNCAN: So back to, because this is quite interesting for now economics. So a lot of people who do software engineering placements in, you know, banks like Morgan, Stanley Investment banks, like Morgan Stanley won't necessarily have any financial knowledge. So, how useful was your economics?

JASON: GCSE?

DUNCAN: Your general interest in it, as well. In, you know, some some engineers have little or no interest in economics. It's just well, this is a, this is a place where they do software engineering so I'll work there. How useful is the economics interest in helping you that?

JASON: Um, so yeah, I guess, yeah, it was really helpful because I already knew like, a lot of what they were talking about. At least the the basic ideas of, you know, what is a stock? What is a bond? What is this? What is that? That made that a lot easier and then additions that I took *Fundamentals of Finance* in my in the second semester, right? Of university kind of in, not to the placement. So that allowed me to kind of like top up on my knowledge and make sure I kind of knew that at least some of the basic concepts. So, but even once I started, you know, people are really like happy to explain stuff to you and explain concepts to you. So one thing, one thing I really the point of doing was to schedule meetings with the finance side of, you know. So basically any people, the finance people would work with because kind of the way things work in Morgan Stanley is kind of the tech teams are separate from the finance teams but you usually have a couple points of contact where you can kind of, get clarification on, you know, the requirements of what you're building or something like that. So I was able to kind of talk to finance, people. Get a better idea of what was going on as well. Thoughts of the people on, on my side, on the tech side to you knew what's going on. I'm from there. You know, I think I think one thing I'd say to people is that I think even if you don't have much finance knowledge I think it's less about what you know when you start a more about what you're you know, willing to work. You're willing to put the work in.

DUNCAN: Yeah. Yeah, being able to understand the business is always beneficial. You're not just a techie to write code, in a back room somewhere. You need to understand the business requirements and what they mean and how a business people see it, or how the traders see it

JASON: Morgan Stanely is quite good with that, I mean there's training the first week you do like group training and where you get like a bunch of different talks. So there's tech specific talks, we're like which are just going to take people's understand that the tech stack and stuff and then there's general finance talks which are basically just you know what is an investment bank? You know, what does that mean? What is the buy and sell side and whatever?

DUNCAN: So, following on from your placement, you've got a summer internship which was that was that remote as well.

Or were you physically remote the gift that keeps on giving and, but yeah. So that was, I did some internship with Google which was actually yeah. It was pretty, pretty story that one. So So yeah, I've always been pretty ambitious. So for me like the placement I wasn't like dead set amongst only obviously I did really find finance interesting but I didn't what I went on a hedge my bets and see, you know, after I think I finished a place with about three or four months to spare before I started university again.

So I figured if I have that time and COVID is still a thing, I'm not gonna be going anywhere. So I might as well, you know, do an internship. So I was applying to, you know, a bunch of different places like Facebook, Bloomberg, a couple hedge funds. And yeah, it was just interviewing alongside the placement, which was, you know, pretty tough to be fair because, you know, preparing while working a full-time job.

Yeah. Really. Difficult a lot of late nights. Well, you know, I'd log off work and then turn around and be up, like, hackerrank and leetcode. But yeah, like, we'll see. It worked in my favour. I mean, do you think you could have got that job at Google without the Morgan Stanley just saying sometimes?

Having that bit of experience, it help it helps because they'll ask you about situations that into here. When I you know in my current job I'm doing this and that can help. Whereas, I think going from zero to Google is a big ask for a lot of people. I think exactly.

Definitely, definitely helps I'd say just from especially from like a confidence perspective because it kind of by the time I'd even started applying and interviewing I had maybe five months under my belt with Morgan Stanley. So I was pretty confident in my abilities, you know, I've gotten great feedback from my from my managers and everyone I'd work to have seemed to, you know, put up with me pretty well.

So yeah. So from a conference effective and also from like a this in terms of my actual technical ability, I would definitely a lot a lot stronger than I would have been. I think like one one, the biggest reasons I recommend doing a placement. People was kind of it allows you to tie together all different concepts you learn in the, in the bachelors you kind of you pick up all different concepts, but they kind of comment at you so fast.

You don't have time to like stop and figure out where they will, where what they mean relative to each other. So yeah. I was able to you know, get really competent and that made into the interviewing process like pretty straightforward. You know, I thought pretty quiet. I got to pretty much everywhere I applied to, but you know, Google N.com even coming through first.

So I was pretty happy with that British, basically the best company of the arts for and yeah. What are you doing at Google? I mean, I I guess there's probably stuff you can't talk about but moving the generally, what were you doing? So yeah, I guess I was working with the Fitbit team.

So Fitbit for those that might not know. Fitbit was acquired by Google in at the start of 2021. So that was literally a couple months before I started having the required February or I think March 2021 and I started like July 2021. So right Fitbit hasn't actually been a part of Google for very long.

So I guess it was kind of. It was like a Google internship but at the same time a Fitbit internships I kind of got a bit of both interesting. Yeah it's a bit weird because their systems haven't been fully integrated with Google systems yet. So migrating things doing, everything's kind of strings are kind of moved a lot of moving parts, sort of things going on.

So I kind of got to work with some Google people. Some people who don't know anything about Google or just with Fitbit, like they all they know is Fitbit is dead as part of Google Now. So it was interesting and regards the actual like, the technical details of the project I worked on, it's basically like a smartwatch app so I was working on app for the fit that an upcoming.

Fitbit smartwatch. I can't go into details about the app does but yeah, Google watch eventually essentially so that was that was really cool. Yeah. Got to I've never done it kind of like smartwatch app development or even like that before. It's quite low level stuff was it? I'm a bill with web application stuff but I'm talking to to the hardware.

So basically so first the application star so designing that Google's really big on like making sure your design is solid first before you start coding. So I couldn't even really do any coding for the first, like maybe almost a month for the internship. I did like a little bits here and there to get a feel free about, um, so yeah.

So did a lot of like app design stuff. Figuring out what, what? It would look like on the smartwatch, what it should do in addition to some low-level stuff to actually do some essentially, there's some new hardware. There were some new hardware functionality, that was coming to the up to the watch that they were bringing bringing out that we wanted to make use of.

So, but the problem was, there was no existing, you know, interfaces. I just say, like API interfaces between, you know, the code and the hardware for that particular piece of functionality. So, on top of having to the design, the app I also had to design that API right into it.

So the design that from scratch which involved a lot of kind of thankfully had access to the source code for the Fitbit SD like at development SDK. They're able to kind of dig into that and grab grab what I needed and glue stuff together and figure out something without my manager.

Yeah yeah. So thankfully the project was good because I got a feel for both the app design stuff and it also the kind of low level like okay. How do I actually make this work in a half of a hardware perspective? Like yeah should the API look like and I was left to do that by myself.

So yeah I'm good experience. It's really good experience really experience. So when you come back to university, so after your your two placement and internship, we came back to do your final year here and you sent essentially trying to pull out things all together. So what do you do?

Your final year project on was that? Yeah, so my finally, a project was essentially like a hand, gesture recognition system, so it kind of was a, it's kind of exploration of like the feasibility of making, like, a really portable easy to use hand gesture recognition that kind of be using like any machine, any architectural whatever.

So, yeah, so kind of evolved to taking a lot of existing technologies and bringing them bringing them all together. And yeah, one of the technologies I use is actually developed by Google called media pipe which I made use of to essentially perform like the hand tracking and stuff hand tracking and feature extraction, which I then use a neural network for classify that makes sense.

Right? So taking some sort of video feed or exactly. So essentially a video feed a video feeds being passed for like, you know, hands if hands present inside the like in view of the camera features like strategies are basically just points on the hand and then that's fed into a neuro network, which basically tells you okay, what gestures being performed, right?

And the idea is that I would create both create like that really robust and lightweight system that can be used anywhere and it also use it and apply it to a particular end. Use case and improves the user experience, both from disabled and able-body people. So I took that and then used it with used it with Spotify.

So essentially make like a music player which has allow you to like increase and decrease volume. Some more exactly, exactly. So so yeah, that was that essentially what I did, right and good. And so again, I mean he's gonna give you a chance to dig into a bit more, what AI stuff I guess you haven't done a huge amount of up until that point?

Yeah. Yeah, done a bit on the course but I wanted to kind of see what I could do to kind of make AI work for me and kind of just do my own thing with it, like be creative with it because you're nothing like this really using the nothing like this, had really been done before in them, especially using the technologies I was using.

So I guess that was kind of the, the most interesting aspects of it. So I'm kind of bringing all the different pieces together and seeing what if you could actually improve these experience for something which, yeah, which was proven to be the case, like, with some user surveys. I did and whatnot for like, able-bodied on the disabled people and yeah, it's pretty, pretty pleased about them.

That's all done. You literally just come from your presentation. Yeah, just so that's the end of your last thing. Last formal thing. Like that's everything for graduation feel. So and what your plans for the future. What? What comes next? What comes after? Yeah. So I guess the plan is, thankfully, I've measured receiver return that I've received a return off of both more, the Stanley and Google, but, you know, I went with Google just because have alliance more if I want to do long-term.

So, I mean, in London, or maybe in London, so I'll be starting with Google in October last year. So I'm just, yeah, thank you so much. Just gonna take the summer travel Asian. Yeah, the medium term that's gonna be travelling, taking it easy a bit before after, you know, enter the working world.

You know, do nine to fives. Yeah, I mean it's kind of it's quite a rare opportunity. Isn't it to get that much time off when once you're working, you don't get three months after exactly enjoy it. All my placement money is going on this essentially and then yeah, I guess long longer time than that, I didn't really.

For I do still find fine, that's quite interesting. I think a part of me will always be like, you know, interesting doing something that kind of blends both tech and I'm fine. That's yeah. I was looking at, as an Apple have been in the headlines recently because their pay system, their their basically, leaving more more like a bank.

Oh yeah, yeah, that kind of expansions apple pears in the past. They've been partnered with Goldman Sachs, But now they're kind of doing everything going on their own. And it's kind of, that's kind of really interesting space what's happening there. It's like exactly exactly. And who knows what feature look like?

What bank was gonna look like in the future? Yeah, exactly that. Everything's just gonna be one big tech company. This one, it's also done, but that's kind of my plan. Yeah, maybe I should move to finance in a couple years. I love to you know maybe because like maybe a hedge fund, the work on like text off there or go to kind of something more small to medium size.

Like some kind of like fintech star that kind of thing. Maybe that'd be cool. Like maybe three, four years from now kind of see. Yeah. For the time being starting my career with Google and you know, see how well that goes and well enjoy and and good luck. So thank you.

So and to finish up then. So there's a this bit is called Minority port so I'd be interested as you remember. Over minority group David Black I've been here about what your experience have been has been being black in computer science but being black in the university but then also in the workplace as well.

What's up being like honestly and then what could the university do? And what could we perhaps we in computer science do to make it more welcoming. And I guess it's difficult being in a minority for lots of different reasons. And then, perhaps what employers can do as well? Perhaps you've got, could say a little bit about, I don't know, Morgan Stanley and Google are both, you know, keen to improve diversity in their workforce, but it's it's an uphill battle for everyone.

I think so, any thoughts on that and what how we can do it better in the future? What we experience has been today and how we could improve it in the future. Um, it's I think it's more just a case of my experience has been good. Like I've never felt, you know, out of place.

I made plenty of friends on the course. I think the main thing is just there are very few black people. Like in my eager group. I've been one of the first thing. How many? No yeah great. Yeah I think when I first started and first year obviously my placements on the shifted me away from some people think maybe free for people total out of about 50 to.

Yeah similar Morgan Stanley, was it was there more diversity? There was a did not much not much. I think in general like I'm pretty used to being the only black person in the room or being close. Close enough to it. I mean there were some other like a black people at the company, you know, I was able to get meetings on the board with but oh but particularly in in the tech space not that many having only only a few but I've you know, made a lot of new contacts and more custody that were black.

And but yeah, in general, I'd say the problem isn't necessarily like how I mean, bloody won't treat anything different. I think, especially in all part of the world, like, we're pretty far past that like nobody's, I think until I have never experienced any kind of prejudice, like while I was at work or anything like that.

But I'd say the main issue is just getting more people, more black people into that. These kind of spaces. So, like, especially considering that from like a socio-economic perspective, you know, people from my background don't tend to, you know, go to higher education or to, you know, especially or to even start your computer science and to get into tech.

So, I say the biggest thing, you know, both campuses and companies can do just just keep them when they're doing. Keep trying, keep trying to get more black people, you know, into the spaces. And from a university respective, I'd say more could be done for regardless of that kind of helping with the financial aspects of university and like, to make that more painting, like offering more, you know, scholarships slash bursaries and this, and that just kind of doing more to kind of ease the transition that makes sense.

Yeah. Yeah, it can be a pull, you know, a lot of people because I think computer science, you know, regardless, you know, whatever your gender or race or whatever. I think computer science is sometimes people don't feel like they belong, right? So it's kind of making people feel like you belong here, whoever you are, and whatever your background, whatever you're interested.

You do you know computer sciences are subject. That is for everyone. And it doesn't quite have that appeal or maybe no subject does really truly, but making it more appealing to a wider group of people would be beneficial for everyone thing. Difficult to get there. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. But yeah, in general, I'd say that experience has been I think in university in general, like not, I think the, I think that UAM, I think the stats are like, less than 3% of the student population is like black or anything like that.

So, the road, the proportioning computer science is pretty much reflects the flex. Yeah, university. Exactly, exactly. This aren't many black people in. I mean, the thing that really a thing that hit me was when I mean, when you were in Morgan Stanley and you posted something, I think it was on LinkedIn or somewhere with your, your picture in, in Times Square, and, you know, visited investment banks.

And that was when it kind of hit me. I hadn't realised, how, how white it was. Yeah, I saw your face and thought, oh my god, that's Jason. Oh, recognise him. But also how white that world is. Yeah, privilege world. It's a very little money but it's also very very white.

Exactly, exactly. And I think, I think that could hold some people from, like my kind of background back, you know, people might grow up in like pretty, you know, black areas. A lot of people, their schools, all kind of look like them. And then they kind of shunted into the professional environment.

And they're not even, they haven't really had many interactions right people in general. Yeah. So that can be that combin issue for some people as well. Like thankfully I went to a pretty like diverse school. I got a pretty good mix of people at my school. So but yeah.

First I know people who like, in London they went to schools which would maybe night, 18, 90% black. So it's kind of like when they do kind of come to university and kind of leave that bubble, it's they can feel bit out of place. Yeah, that can definitely be an issue.

We don't I mean, I know in the US they have universities that are much traditional black and we don't again I don't think we really have there is kind of yeah, strange on that. Yeah. But I'm a big believer. Personally of that kind of different people mixing mixing together and like, kind of, yeah.

Travel like, yeah. So I mean, in my opinion, I don't even think we'd even really need put like black campuses or anything like that. I think the biggest thing is just, just adding more diversity. You're getting a bigger mix of people and yeah. Yeah. But that's obviously something that has to be done over the very long.

Yeah. Parliers role models, as well as exactly itself is the people can see. Oh, you know. This is what? This is possible. Something people can then. Did you do any work with schools? Well, I know Morgan signs is quite a work with schools. Did you do any? And because Hamlets I would have if it was in person but COVID like it wasn't really much, I can't do.

But I mean I was eager to you, but I think when I go back to London, one thing I want to do is kind of start going to kind of like in the city schools and show. Like I'm just a regular guy from London. Regular black guy from London, like, nothing that crazy about me.

I just, you know, worked pretty hard and managed to, you know, make something of of, you know, this whole tech thing. So, yeah, I recommend all my friends, I'm always tell my friends, I listen look at tech text, pretty good decks, pretty chill, you know, good money, you know, good work life balance.

I would tell people, but I'm I think in addition to the racial thing, I say a briefing, the whole feel back from tech. And general. They kind of like what he is. It's not an easy subject. It's not easy thing to get into, but I think people think it's like impossible to get into you.

I wanted to be a genius program. A genius to be old people, I tell people. Oh yeah, I'm starting with Google piecing. That You must be amazing. You must be a genius. You're like I'm no I'm not I'm not pretty hard. I work pretty hard and you know I'm competent.

I know I'm doing as but I mean, I'm not crazy. I'm not like an autistic. You know, specialists of anything really? I'm just kind of, you know, I find it interesting. I've worked hard and acquired, you know, skill was good enough to know work at these companies. So that's all people, you know?

It's just, it's okay. Sort of. If you take your time, you're willing to be consistent and you know do it as like a proper thing. I think a big thing of tech is that you kind of have to do over long period of time and just gradually soaking all the skills.

But yeah. But it's like one of my colleagues talks about, it's like sedimentation. It's like things settle slowly. You don't know. It's gonna get it straight away. Might exactly months. Maybe even years to some content. That's actually click. Exactly. Exactly what I think. A lot of people that I've spoken to, that kind of try and get into tech and try and do codeine.

They could they do code for maybe like maybe two three weeks and then like yeah, I couldn't figure out. All right. You kind of need to do. Maybe I think you can't even say you really giving it a try and sleep. Don't be six months. I say, oh yeah free to six months of actual of graft and then maybe you can now, say, okay?

Maybe this is always on for me but yeah. Yeah. Okay good. So to finish up then. So we've so this podcast is part of coding your future and it has a soundtrack with it at the end. So it's kind of music where maybe musical references in the text sometimes only because I'm because I'm older, I kind of a lot of these references, a older these references.

So, can you recommend us one tune to rejuvenate our payload playlist with One podcast that you've listened to or enjoyed. You recommend other students might like, and one film if there's time as well. So let's start with one tune tune. It could be something that you helps you relax.

It might make you feel happy or remind you of home or, you know, might be something that helps you study. You know, my or the opposite. Something that helps you get your mind off study when you're when you're stressy. Mmm. I mean, I'm not sure. I mean, if your big fan of hip hop, like I'm a really big fan of hip hop, but that kind of thing like, American American like rap and stuff.

So, I say anything by [Don Toliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Toliver). I mean, I don't know if you people probably might not have been but don't olive oil, like a really big I just about, I call it on toll about. I'm big. Big, big, big fan, right?

So I yeah, anything by him. Guys, guys. Should like, if you want, like a chill, like hip hop, kind of vibe type thing. Yeah, good. Okay. And then one podcast that you listen to recommend one, I really recommend is under the skin, by Russell Brand. So kind of for those you may not know that.

Who Rosa brand is Russell Brandon is like he was a really big like kind of musician. Reality TV guy for a while because I just a little things and then you kind of went on a bit of a bit of a bender kind of lost himself to kind of drugs and addiction and stuff like that and then kind of a fame and then he kind of in his recovery and he kind of rediscovered himself from became like a really like I really like the person that you just kind of really like completely reformed himself and he has like a podcast called under the skin where he brings different people on to talk about different.

You know, why the ranges for things like sometimes we'll talk about like spiritual things to talk about, like, you know, the concept of the soul, and what it means like, life and death and stuff like that. You can get really deep like that. Or you might just do stuff about, like social economic stuff about like, you know, current issues and, you know, current problems we have in our society right now.

And yeah, it's really good, like blend of like just a bunch of different things. So yeah, I recommend if anyone looking to kind of broaden the horizons, sounds good. Well I'll put a link in the show. Not. And then the last one was a film any films between or not recently.

You know, any films that you'd recommend people go and watch. I was working more on Netflix or wherever, wherever people consume films these days. I recommend my favourite movie, probably all time the matrix, the first one, not the first one, not the fourth one. That's come out now. Like everyone, listen for fun.

Don't watch it. It's trash. But also very nation in it as though the graphics are amazing. The CGI is amazing. The story. Yeah. No. Yes. But I mean, I was ungrate fan. But, I mean, the first original, the first matrix was won, the movies. I always tell people that and Iron Man are the things that made me like computers right in first place, right?

So, yeah, I'd recommend yeah. The matrix, The Matrix warn you, my favourite food is that film? That must be came in Kmart in the 2000s. Oh, 1999. I think about 99.93 guy 20. Yeah, it's crazy you. Yeah, pretty much pretty much. Yeah, but yeah, good. All right. Well, thank you, Jason.

And is there any other closing comments before we? So actually, we have one there was advice to your former self. So what would you tell your former self or a current first? Second year student about who's studying computer science. What should they focus on? I would say, the biggest thing is right, don't sell yourself short.

Like you don't need to be, you don't need to be a genius to work any of these, kind of why I've been telling people years below. You ask me about my experiences like you don't need to be that. Don't need to be crazy. Like just work hard and know what you're talking about.

Just be competent and believe. Honestly, this have confidence, I think a big part of it is confidence. People kind of projects this idea of like, oh, I'm just not good enough to work at these places. And, you know, when people see me, I'm pretty outgoing pretty, like friendly guy.

And they see me like, okay, I'm doing all the Stanley and Google, they must fit, they think. Oh, like it kind of spins them a bit. They kind of think in order to make make anything out yourself and taking the, she kind of need to kind of give up life and do that make that your whole life.

I mean, you have to work hard but I mean, I still go out on the weekend. I'll still. You know, I'm put holidays line up for the summer. I'm still being my thing. So, yeah, I think biggest, biggest piece of advice with this pizza, this have confidence and, you know, you only and you only need one.

Yes. So you really need. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Started. Right. Okay. That's a good note to finish on. So thank you. Jason, they're probably just recording.
