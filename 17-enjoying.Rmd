# Enjoying your future {#enjoying}
Music has a deep connection to your mental health and sense of wellbeing we discussed in chapter \@ref(nurturing). Music has the ability to comfort and connect you to yourself and to others. Music provides motivation, gratification and empathy. This chapter explores that and gathers all the musical references in this guidebook into a series of playlists which are accompanied with some more explanation and context.

## The Coders playlist {#coders}
In *Hearing your Future* (chapter \@ref(hearing)) we ask our guests to recommend a tune that is important to them. These are gathered into *The Coders Playlist* and incremented with every new episode of the podcast: it's `Music++`.

## Lancashire boy bands {#lancs}
This playlist starts and ends with one of the best known Lancashire [boy bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band) on the planet: [The Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles) shown in figure \@ref(fig:the-beatles-fig). You will find plenty of other Lancashire lads and even the occasional Lancashire [lass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lass) in here too. Which cities are actually in Lancashire I hear you say? Don't let the pen-pushers down at City Hall trick you into believing that:

* Manchester is in a place called *[Greater Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester)*
* Liverpool is in a place called *[Merseyside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside)*

These are *meaningless* bureaucratic abstractions, not **real places**! Liverpool and Manchester have been in [Lancashire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire) for over four hundred years. [@northerners]

```{r the-beatles-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "33%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbeatles)"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/the-beatles.jpeg", 3))
```

(ref:captionbeatles) [John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon), [Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney), [Ringo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Starr) and [George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison) from Liverpool, Lancashire.

Bursting with [Red Roses of Lancaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rose_of_Lancaster) this playlist will inform and entertain in equal measure. To paraphrase [Robbie Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Williams):

> Come on, let me, educate you! [@entertainyou]

## Electronica {#electronica}
This playlist celebrates [electronica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronica) and other computationally influenced music. In 1951, engineers of the [Ferranti Mark 1 computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1), implemented a `hoot` function that was used to sound a prompt when input was required. Alan Turing realised that this could be reprogrammed to make different notes and created a routine that played a note of a specified pitch.

```{r draughts-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "33%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiondraughts)"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/draughts.png", 3))
```

(ref:captiondraughts) Is this the worlds first [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game)? Playing Christopher Strachey's draughts on a computer with a cathode ray tube in 1952. When the game finished, the computer (a [Ferranti Mark 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1)) played a tune. Public domain image from Wikimedia Commons at [w.wiki/5UJs](https://w.wiki/5UJs)

Using Turing's code the computer scientist [Christopher Strachey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Strachey) wrote programs to play music. Strachey's first success was a version of the UK's national anthem *God Save the Queen* [@godsavethequeen] which was played at the end of what is probably the first video ever game created, [draughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers) shown in figure \@ref(fig:draughts-fig). [@programmingenter] The earliest existing recording of computer-generated music was made in 1951 by the BBC, in which the Ferranti Mark I can be heard playing three songs:

1. *[God Save the Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen)* [@godsavethequeen]
1. *[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baa,_Baa,_Black_Sheep)* [@baabaablacksheep]
1. *[In the Mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Mood)* [@inthemood]

You can hear this music which was carefully restored by [Jack Copeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Copeland) and Jason Long in 2016. [@restoringmusic]

Computers have been changing the way we create, distribute and listen to music ever since. Sing like no one is listening, love like you never been hurt and dance like no one is watching.

## Dad rock {#dadrock}
Using the medium of rock, this playlist grumpily reminds you that “*when I was your age*” music was much better and it's all gone downhill since the good old days. Nostalgia isn't what it used to be but these classics were made by *true* artists.

Cherished by men of a certain age, the Dad rock playlist thrives on past glories but is a shadow of it's former self. Proponents of Dad rock can't understand why more people don't enjoy these classic and seminal tunes of yesteryear. [@dadrock; @dadrock2]

* **Do say:** Expiry date: What expiry date? Good music like this is timeless!
* **Don't say:** Oh no, not this again!

## Indie rock {#indie}
Muddier than the traditional summer downpour at the [Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival), this playlist encourages you to swing your cardigan mournfully while [shoegazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze) and wondering if its *ever* going to stop raining, either metaphorically or meteorologically. ☔️

> [Why does it always rain on me?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Does_It_Always_Rain_on_Me%3F) Is it because I lied when I was seventeen? —[Fran Healy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Healy_(musician)) [@whydoesitalwaysrainonme]

::: {.rmdcaution}
* **Do say:** It's indie rock and roll for me. [@indierocknroll]
* **Don't say:** Cheer up hun, life's not *that* bad. [@depressingindie]

## Thanks Jim! {#jimusic}
Thanks to [Jim Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_John_Miles) for the descriptions of the birth of electronic music installed in the Kilburn building Atlas suite shown in figure \@ref(fig:atlassuite-fig). Some of the text from these displays has been adapted and re-used in section \@ref(electronica). [@ieeemilestones]
