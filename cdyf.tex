Welcome to Coding Your Future, the guidebook that will help you to design, build, test, debug and code your future in computing. This guidebook is aimed at students in higher education, both those studying Computer Science as part of their degree or those from other disciplines with an interest in computing.

This guidebook supports second year teaching at the University of Manchester, but it DOES NOT MATTER:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  what \emph{stage} of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year
\item
  what \emph{level} you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate
\item
  what \emph{subject} you are studying, although curiosity about computing is desirable
\item
  what \emph{institution} you are studying at, this book is University and institution agnostic
\item
  \emph{where} in the world you are studying
\end{itemize}

So there is something in this guidebook for every student of computing, young and old. üåéüåçüåè

\hypertarget{aims-of-this-guidebook}{%
\section{Aims of this guidebook}\label{aims-of-this-guidebook}}

\emph{Coding your future} explores techniques for making career decisions, job searching, submitting applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace.

Alongside these practical engineering issues, this guidebook also encourages you to \emph{design your future} by taking a step back and reflecting on the bigger picture. You will apply \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking}{computational thinking} techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people and what your experience is. As there is a computational theme, you will also need to reflect on what your inputs and outputs (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output}{I/O}) are, both now and in the future. You'll also need to think about what recipes (or algorithms) you might start experimenting with

This guidebook tackles professional issues in computing, for those with and without Computer Science degrees in the early stage of their careers.

\hypertarget{bilo}{%
\section{What you will (and won't) learn}\label{bilo}}

After reading this guidebook, watching the videos and doing the exercises you will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Improve your self-awareness by describing who you are, what motivates you and your strengths and weaknesses
\item
  Decide on a job search strategy and identify employers, sectors and roles that are of interest to you\\
\item
  Improve your written communication skills both for job applications and collaborating with other people
\item
  Plan and prepare competitive written applications using standard techniques including CVs, covering letters, application forms and digital profiles
\item
  Compete successfully in interviews and assessment centres by preparing for technical and non-technical questions
\item
  Plan further steps in your career such as promotion, postgraduate study \& research, alternative employment and longer term goals
\end{enumerate}

This book will NOT teach you how to write code, there's already lots of fantastic resources to help you do that. We discuss some of them in chapter six \protect\hyperlink{computing}{Computing Your Future}.

\hypertarget{prereq}{%
\subsection{Prerequisites}\label{prereq}}

As the title of this guidebook implies, there is a computational flavour here, but you do not have to be studying Computer Science to benefit. There are two main target audiences for this guidebook:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of their degree. This includes software engineering, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction (HCI), information systems, health informatics, data science, gaming, cybersecurity and all the other myriad flavours of Computer Science
\item
  Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying \emph{any} subject, with little or no Computer Science at all. You are curious to know about what role computing could play in your future career. Computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists.
\end{enumerate}

So the prerequisites for this book are that you are studying (or have studied) at University where English is one of the main spoken languages. You \emph{may} have some experience already, either casual, voluntary or otherwise, but this book does \textbf{not} assume that you have already been employed in some capacity.

\hypertarget{gut}{%
\subsection{Don't read this, gut it!}\label{gut}}

I don't recommend you read this book from cover to cover in one sitting. Instead, I suggest you follow the advice given to historian \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodruff}{William Woodruff} about reading books when he was at University:

\begin{quote}
``You don't READ books, you GUT them!'' \citep{nabend} üêü
\end{quote}

So, gut this book like a fish. Identify the chapters that are most useful to you (the flesh), and skip the rest (the guts). Which chapters are flesh and which are guts will depend on what stage of the journey you are at. This guidebook is designed to be as ``guttable'' as possible.
To aid gutting, the version published at \href{https://www.cdyf.me/}{cdyf.me} has a built in search and tables of contents. Before you can gut the fish, you'll need a map.

\hypertarget{mapping}{%
\section{Mapping your future}\label{mapping}}

This guidebook is split into three parts. The first part is on \href{bothering.html}{designing your future} while the second is on \href{debugging.html}{building and testing your future} shown in the map in Figure \ref{fig:map-fig}. The final part is a \href{ruling.html}{help} section, for supporting your future. Let's look in a bit more detail at the content of each of the three parts of this guidebook:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Course Map} 

}

\caption{Mapping your future: Each yellow dot on this diagram is a chapter in \emph{Coding Your Future}. The chapters on the left tackle design issues like \emph{who are you}? Chapters on the right tackle the practicalities of executing and testing your career choices, such as \emph{debugging your CV}.

\end{figure}



\hypertarget{parti}{%
\subsection{Designing your future}\label{parti}}

The first part of this guidebook (chapters 1 to 6) looks at what engineers call \emph{design}. When you build anything, a bridge, a piece of software, a car or a plane you'll need to do some design. Building a career isn't that different to building anything else, you'll need to do some design work and it will probably be iterative. Designing things often involves asking tricky questions. So when you're designing your future you'll need to cover the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The first chapter \href{bothering.html}{why bother?} looks at why you should bother reading any of this book
\item
  The second chapter \href{knowing.html}{who are you?} challenges you to reflect on who you are, what makes you unique and why you are here
\item
  The third chapter looks at \href{wellbeing.html}{your well-being}, and how to take care of your mental and physical health
\item
  The fourth chapter \href{communicating.html}{soft skills are hard} explores your soft skills, how they complement your hard skills and why employers value them so much
\item
  The fifth chapter \href{experiencing.html}{are you experienced?} asks you to reflect on your work experience and help identify where you can improve it
\item
  The sixth chapter \href{computing.html}{computing your future} looks at the role computing can play in your career, with or without a Computer Science degree
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{partii}{%
\subsection{Building and testing your future}\label{partii}}

The next six chapters look at building and testing your future, what engineers like to call \emph{implementation} or \emph{execution}. Once you've started to answer the design questions in the first part, you can start to implement (or build) your career and think about what the next steps will be.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The seventh chapter helps you to \href{debugging.html}{debug your CV} alongside other written communication such as covering letters, application forms and digital portfolios.
\item
  The eighth chapter looks at \href{finding.html}{your job search and networks}, where can you look for interesting opportunities
\item
  The ninth chapter looks \href{interviewing.html}{your interviews and offers}, how can you turn interviews to your advantage and negotiate any offers you receive
\item
  The tenth chapter looks at \href{surviving.html}{your survival and promotion}, once you've landed a job, how will you survive and thrive outside (and after) University
\item
  The eleventh chapter looks at \href{studying.html}{postgraduate study} is a Masters degree or a PhD right for you?
\item
  The twelfth chapter looks at \href{broadening.html}{your alternatives} and encourages you to broaden your horizons. Perhaps you could be a freelancer or contractor? Maybe you want to start your own business and employ others or you'd like to work in the non-profit or public sector? The possibilities are endless.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{partiii}{%
\subsection{Supporting your future}\label{partiii}}

The third part of this book, contains supporting material that will help the design, build and test phases described above:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The thirteenth chapter summarises the whole guidebook in \href{ruling.html}{Ten Simple Rules for Coding your Future}.
\item
  The fourteenth chapter introduces you to some fictitious candidates and invites you to \href{sampling.html}{Debug their CV}
\item
  The fifteenth chapter looks at careers outside of the capital because it's \href{notjustlondon.html}{Not Just London}
\item
  The sixteenth chapter interviews students after returning from their placements in the \href{https://www.cdyf.me/listening.html}{Coding your Future podcast}
\item
  The seventeenth chapter shows how to emphasising your actions on your CV by putting the \href{verbs.html}{verbs first}
\item
  The \href{references.html}{references section} provides the essential signposts alongside everything (yes, everything!) else I've cited in this guidebook
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{themes}{%
\section{Recurring themes}\label{themes}}

Each chapter of the book contains the following sections:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{What you will learn} what I expect you to learn from a given chapter
\item
  \textbf{Video and audio} short videos to watch and sometimes audio to listen to
\item
  \textbf{Assessments} activities and quizzes that will be assessed either by yourself, your peers, an employer or an academic (depending on who and where you are)
\item
  \textbf{Coding challenges} are designed to take you out of your comfort zone by suggesting new experiments for you to try, some of these are thought experiments (think about or discuss something) others are more practical (doing something)
\item
  \textbf{Essential signposts} - seriously useful resources that I recommend you read, listen to or watch
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{thanks}{%
\section{Acknowledgements}\label{thanks}}

The content of this book is based on hundreds of conversations I have had with students of Computer Science, Maths, Physics and Engineering since 2012. I've also spoken to many of their employers too.

\hypertarget{students}{%
\subsection{Standing on the shoulders of students}\label{students}}

First and foremost, I'd like to thank all the students who have helped with this book, both directly and indirectly.

\begin{quote}
``If I have seen further it is by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants}{standing on the shoulders of students}.'' \citep{newton}
\end{quote}

So, if you have studied some flavour of Computer Science at the University of Manchester since 2012, there's a high probability you have contributed to this book. Thank you for telling me your stories, being ambitious, hard working, talented, fearless, creative, inspirational and listening to me. It has been my pleasure and privilege to work with you all.

\end{figure}



I'd especially like to thank industrial experience (IE) students who completed a year in industry as part of their degree as well as those who have done summer internships, either as part of the Master of Engineering (MEng) program or otherwise. In addition, the \href{http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk}{PASS leaders} and facilitators, \href{https://unicsmcr.com/}{UniCSmcr.com}, \href{https://github.com/unicsmcr/hacksoc.com}{HackSoc}, \href{https://github.com/cssoc}{CSSoc} and \href{https://github.com/Man-UP}{Manchester Ultimate Programming} members have all been influential on the content of this book. I've learned heaps by manually trawling through thousands of your CVs too, so if you've shown me a copy of your CV, thanks! If you sent me a CV and I didn't reply, I apologise. There are limits to what is humanly possible. The chapters on \href{debugging.html}{debugging your CV} (self assessment) and \href{sampling.html}{debugging their CV} (peer assessment) are based on the most common bugs (or are they features?) I've seen in CVs.

So, thank you students for being studious. üôè

\hypertarget{employers}{%
\subsection{Thanks to employers}\label{employers}}

Thanks to all the organisations who have employed students from the Department of Computer Science as either summer interns, year long placements or graduates. A big chunk of this guidebook documents their experience of employers and their graduate recruitment programs.

Thanks to Niall Beard and \href{https://github.com/sharifsalah}{Sharif Salah} at Google for introducing me to Google's Technical Writing course. \citep{googling}

So, thanks employers for employing our students. üôè

\hypertarget{colleagues}{%
\subsection{Thanks to colleagues}\label{colleagues}}

I've also had significant support from academic colleagues in the Department of Computer Science (\href{https://twitter.com/csmcr}{@csmcr}) and support staff at the University of Manchester. (\href{https://twitter.com/ManUniCareers}{@ManUniCareers}, \href{https://twitter.com/alumniUoM}{@alumniUoM}, \href{https://twitter.com/OfficialUoM}{@OfficialUoM})

I would especially like to thank \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_John_Miles}{Jim Miles} for encouraging me to write a book shortly after he offered me a job. I thought he was joking (about the book) but it actually turned out to be another one of Jim's great ideas. Thanks Jim. üôè

Optimists will tell you that ``everyone has a book in them\ldots{}'', but pessimists like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens}{Christoph Hitchens} will add that ``\ldots in most cases that's where it should remain''. \citep{everyone}

Despite Hitchens amusing trademark cynicism shown in figure \ref{fig:hitchens-fig}, I am an optimist when it comes to the power of natural languages.

Many of the illustrations for this book have been drawn by the very talented Bryan Mathers \href{https://twitter.com/BryanMMathers/}{@BryanMMathers}. Bryan is an artist, visual thinker and entrepreneur, who also happens to have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Glasgow. His combined skills in art, science and engineering made him the perfect fit for illustrating this guidebook. You can find out more about Bryan at \href{https://bryanmmathers.com}{bryanmathers.com} and \href{https://visualthinkery.com}{visualthinkery.com}. I'm \emph{so} glad we randomly bumped into each other at a conference.

So, thanks Bryan for your witty illustrations, this book wouldn't be the same without your visual thinkery. üôè

\section{About me}\label{duncan}}

Hello, my name is \href{http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/}{Duncan Hull} and I wrote this guidebook for students at the University of Manchester where I'm a lecturer (‚âà \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_professor}{Assistant Professor}) in the \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/}{Department of Computer Science}.

So what's \emph{my} story? Like many people, my path has been what \href{https://twitter.com/HelenTupper}{Helen Tupper} and Sarah Ellis call a ``squiggly career'' rather than classic linear one. \citep{squiggly} I've been gainfully employed as a paperboy, supermarket cashier, shelf stacker, sausage factory worker, pork pie filler, chef, dogsbody, field assistant, database administrator, deli counter server, consultant, matchday steward, juror, high school teacher, postdoc, research scientist, software engineer, lecturer, external examiner, tutor and academic.

I've done a range of voluntary work too, serving as a competition judge, fundraiser, rabble rouser, \href{https://codeclub.org}{code club} \& \href{https://coderdojo.com}{coderdojo} leader, \href{https://www.manchesterdigital.com/}{digital council} member, \href{https://governorsforschools.org.uk/}{school governor}, curator, librarian, beer drinker, \href{https://wiki-loves-scientists.org.uk/}{wikipedia trainer}, \href{https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/}{journal clubber} and editor. But as Ronnie Lane and Ronnie Wood once said:

\begin{quote}
``I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger.'' ---Ronnie Lane \citep{faces}
\end{quote}

This guidebook documents some of what I know now, that I wish I'd known, when I was younger. If you're starting your career, I hope you find these insights useful. I've sat on both sides of the interview table, as interviewer and interviewee. I have had some spectacular failures, alongside some modest successes, and have included personal stories where they are relevant.

Most of what I have learned about employment comes from listening to, and watching students interact with employers as they take the first tentative steps in their careers. I've documented some of what they taught me, so reading this book may help you learn from some of their successes and failures.

\hypertarget{bothering}{%
\chapter{Why should you bother?}\label{bothering}}

The first half of this book is about designing your future. So before we get started, let's tackle a fundamental design issue. Why the hell should you bother reading this guidebook?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  you are a busy person, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è
\item
  your time is a precious and finite resource, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è
\item
  you could be spending that precious time right now in lots of other ways, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è
\item
  there are mountains of self-help guides and courses already, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è
\item
  do you really need \emph{yet another} guidebook? YES! ‚òëÔ∏è
\end{itemize}

You need this guidebook because it is different to all the other guidebooks! It will help you design, test, build and code your future in computing. Come with me \href{https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-h/11-h.htm\#chap01}{down the rabbit hole} in Figure \ref{fig:rabbit-fig} and let me explain\ldots{} üêá

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/Rabbit-hole}

\end{figure}



\hypertarget{ilo1}{%
\section{What you will learn}\label{ilo1}}

After reading this chapter you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify and decide which parts of this book you are going to read
\item
  Set your expectations for using this guidebook
\item
  Travel down the rabbit hole into the underworld of work
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{wonderland}{%
\section{Let's go down the rabbit hole}\label{wonderland}}

In the novel \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice\%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland}{Alice's Adventures in Wonderland}} \citep{wonderland}, the heroine Alice follows a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rabbit}{white rabbit} down a hole. What she discovers is a strange underground world populated by weird and wonderful characters. The world of work can sometimes be a mysterious underworld where you adventure in wonderland accompanied by colourful characters.

You will spend lots of time in this wonderland, potentially as much as 80,000 hours of your life. \citep{iip1, iip2} So join me down the rabbit hole, it's fun honest, and sooner or later you'll have come down here anyway.

\hypertarget{responsibility}{%
\section{Your future is your responsibility}\label{responsibility}}

When \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Stanford-Clark}{Andy Stanford-Clark} started working at IBM, fresh out of University, his boss gave him the following advice:

\begin{quote}
``Nobody cares about your career except you.'' ---Anon \citep{andystanfordclark}
\end{quote}

Andy is now Master Inventor and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at IBM in the UK so it was probably good advice. Another, slightly more positive way of putting the advice is, the person who cares \emph{most} about your career is you. So while there are people who can help design and build your future, ultimately it is \textbf{YOU} who has to take responsibility for the implementation (if you like, the code). The sooner you get coding the better.

At University, there are lots of people can help design and build your future: peers, academic staff, friends, your careers service, employers and your wider network but ultimately it is \emph{your} responsibility to sort out whatever comes next. That might sound obvious but don't wait for somebody else to do it for you, because it probably won't happen.

\hypertarget{entitled}{%
\section{Your degree is not enough}\label{entitled}}

You've worked incredibly hard to get the grades you needed to get into University. You've spent (or are spending) a significant amount of time and money studying whatever it is you are studying at University.

Under these circumstances, you might be tempted to believe that the world owes you something in return for your hard work. Unfortunately that's not the case.

At some point during or after your study, you might find yourself applying for a graduate job or graduate scheme. EVERYONE applying for these opportunities will have a degree or be rapidly on their way to getting one. So having a degree isn't going to set you apart much from your competition. Even having a first class degree \citep{gradeinflation, firstclass} may not distinguish you that much your competitors. Some employers would rather not know (or don't care) what University you went to, so your education might not make you stand out as much as you might like anyway. \citep{bigfour}

What \textbf{will} distinguish you from your competitors will be your \href{experiencing.html}{experience}, your projects, your \href{communicating.html}{communication skills} and any awards or honours you might have picked up along the way. If you think that your degree will be enough to get you the job you want, bear in mind that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There are more and more graduates, the UK for example recently passed the milestone of 50\% of young people going into higher education. This compares to just 15\% of over 18s who stayed in higher education in 1980 \citep{lotsofgrads}
\item
  The increase in the number of graduate schemes and graduate jobs has not kept pace with this growth in graduates which means that each graduate job or graduate scheme has more and more graduates applying for it
\item
  There are lots of graduates in your discipline, for example around 9,000 every year in Computer Science alone in the UK. What makes you different from the other 8,999 computer scientists graduating in your year?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/lotsofgrads-fig-1} 

}

\caption{Percentage of young people in the UK going into higher education between 1980 and 2018. Over the last forty years, the proportion of young people going into higher education has more than doubled from 15\% in 1980 to over 50\% in 2018. Data taken from BBC news article on \href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-49841620}{the symbolic target of 50\% at university reached} \citep{lotsofgrads}}\label{fig:lotsofgrads-fig}
\end{figure}



\begin{quote}
Computing is one of the largest subject areas in UK higher education, and is taught in almost every institution, graduating around 9,000 students every year --Sally Fincher \citep{fincherreview}
\end{quote}

Now, don't be disillusioned by the statistics because a degree can open doors to many careers in computing. What the data in Figure \ref{fig:lotsofgrads-fig} show is that you'll need to look beyond your formal education to distinguish yourself from your competition. Your degree can certainly help you start a career, but it is typically not enough by itself.

\hypertarget{roi}{%
\section{Maximise the return on your investment}\label{roi}}

Studying at University is a significant investment of your time and money. Hopefully, you've picked a subject that stimulates and challenges you intellectually while allowing you to find and develop your unique talents. But there's another reason that you probably chose to study at University and that was to improve your job prospects. This guidebook will:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Help you maximise the return on the substantial investment of time and money (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment}{ROI}) you've put into your study
\item
  Give you an overview of important professional issues that are sometimes neglected or sidelined in University curricula
\item
  Highlight and review essential resources beyond this guidebook that will help with the above
\end{enumerate}

All of the resources that can help you are scattered around in lots of different places. There are books, there are videos, there are podcasts, there are websites and jobs boards. There are online courses, blogs, social media, newspaper columns, journal articles, marketing material and many other good resources. It can be overwhelming.

\hypertarget{thisstuffmatters}{%
\section{Too late when you graduate}\label{thisstuffmatters}}

You might be tempted to postpone making difficult career decisions. I'll do it tomorrow. I'll do it next week. I'll do it next year. I'll finish this assignment. I'll finish this exam. I'll finish this semester. Procrastination is a part of the human condition \citep{procrastination}:

\begin{quote}
``I'll get my degree out of the way first then worry about jobs and careers when I finish University'' --P. Crastinator
\end{quote}

It probably doesn't help that many of issues described and discussed in this book are typically not closely integrated into the curriculum in Higher Education. You'll often find them on the edges, or completely outside of, standard University curricula. Broadly speaking, the professional issues described in this book are usually covered by pastoral support systems, counselling services, careers services, trade organisations, professional bodies, student unions and their societies,.

Despite being sidelined, these issues matter and it is in your own selfish interests to start thinking about them right now. According to recent estimates by \emph{Investors in People}, the average person spends \textbf{80,000 hours} working during their lifetime. \citep{iip2} So, \emph{whatever} you end up doing after University, you'll be spending a lot of time doing it. Difficult decisions often get sidelined but it is never too early to start thinking about them and doing something. The sooner you start thinking about them the better decisions you'll make about what comes next. It's too late when you graduate.

That doesn't mean you have to know EXACTLY what you want to do when you finish. Lots of students don't and I certainly didn't when I graduated. I'd done a gap year teaching in India, two summer internships (in Sweden and the United States) and a year-in-industry in the UK and I \emph{still} graduated with \textbf{no clue} as to what I wanted to do next! The important thing is that you make a start, and sometimes knowing what you \textbf{don't} want to do is just as valuable as knowing what you do.

Computer scientists call this problem search space reduction, \citep{searchspace} there's a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region}{feasible region} of future possibilities and one of the first things you'll need to do is narrow down the candidates. You could think of coding your future is an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem}{optimisation problem}. Start optimising now because it's too late when you graduate. üéì

\hypertarget{exams}{%
\section{Yes, this WILL be on the exam}\label{exams}}

Students love to ask their teachers ``\emph{will this be on the exam}''? The short answer is \textbf{YES} (and \textbf{NO})! Yes, this will be on the exam, but NO the exam won't be set by your University. Unlike other courses you've done, the examinations for this course aren't set by your University but by employers. Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of examinations that you'll need to get good at, shown in Table \ref{tab:examtable}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}

\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

So, \emph{yes}, this will be on the exam, but \emph{no}, the exams are obviously not set, administered, invigilated and marked by academics at your University. The exams are set by employers and the results are \textbf{brutally binary}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{PASS}: you've got the interview, job or promotion or\ldots{}
\item
  \textbf{FAIL}: none of the above. Next!
\end{itemize}

One of the challenging things about employers exams are, they typically do not have the bandwidth to give applicants useful feedback, other than a simple pass or fail. When it comes to job applications software engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell}{Gayle Laakmann McDowell} calls this the ``black hole''. The gravitational force of employers black holes is so strong that no CV or Resume can escape, we'll say more about this in chapter on \protect\hyperlink{debugging}{debugging your CV}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Gimme Some Credit - Sketch} 

}

\caption{\emph{no} this will not be on the exam set by University, but \emph{yes} it will be on the exams set by employers. Some of the most important exams you sit at (and after) University are set by employers. This guidebook will help you prepare for those exams and increase your chances of passing them.

\end{figure}



It's a similar story with interviews, if you fluffed and interview question or came across badly, it can be really difficult to find out from the employer what you did wrong.

\hypertarget{activities}{%
\section{Get your hands dirty}\label{activities}}

There are practical exercises, for you to get your hands dirty with. Each chapter incorporates activities including individual exercises, group exercises, quizzes and points for wider discussion. Just reading a guidebook won't get you very far, you'll need to do the activities in this book to get the most out of it.

\hypertarget{relatedwork}{%
\section{Navigate mountains of advice}\label{relatedwork}}

There are \textbf{lots} of resources out there that offer self-help, career advice and techniques for self-improvement. It can be hard to know where to start, or even how to find your way around the mountains of advice.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/shelfie} 

}

\caption{There are tonnes of resources out there offering advice on the huge range of professional issues. You can't read them all, but this guide will help you navigate the resources that will be most interesting and useful to you}\label{fig:shelfie-fig}
\end{figure}



Lots of professional advice is readily available, but how will you navigate it? This book signposts you to what I think are the most important resources, each chapter has a signposts section, and they are all gathered together in the signpost at the end alongside everything (yes, EVERYTHING!) that this guidebook cites in the \protect\hyperlink{references}{References}.

\hypertarget{joinus}{%
\section{Get credit for your contributions}\label{joinus}}

As well as being openly accessible on the web, this book is open source too. What this means is, you can contribute in several ways

\hypertarget{thinkdifferent}{%
\section{This book is different}\label{thinkdifferent}}

I wrote this guidebook because I needed a resource for students to help them design, build, test and debug their futures. I wanted a single resource that could help students compete for jobs while at University, or shortly after graduating. I could not find anything suitable that met all the requirements of the students I was teaching. So I wrote this one which contains some new material and recommends the best resources if you want to know more. These are found in the signposts sections of each chapter.

This book aims to combine these perspectives and to be different from existing resources in the following ways:

\hypertarget{signposted}{%
\subsection{Well signposted}\label{signposted}}

Some career resources claim (or imply) that they are the \emph{all you will need} to solve a particular problem or worse: solve \emph{all of your problems}! Just buy this book, do this course, watch this video, listen to this podcast and all your problems will go away! Rather than continue this trend, this book \textbf{signposts} some of the most useful resources.

Scientists call this \textbf{citation}, rather than signposting. I've signposted and cited sources in this guidebook so that you can :

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Check and verify any facts and claims I make in this book for yourself
\item
  Go and consult the original sources if you think they might be useful
\end{enumerate}

While this guidebook cites lots of resources, some of them are more important than others. Each chapter summarises these in a signposts section. You'll find everything else in the \protect\hyperlink{referencing}{references} section. The University of Manchester has physical and electronic copies of many (but sadly not all) of the books listed here.

We're not suggesting that you read \emph{all} these books right now, but that if a particular chapter has piqued your interest, these signposts are good places to keep going, if you haven't already read them. I hope you'll find these signposts handy for navigating the mountains of advice. Not all who wander are lost. üó∫Ô∏èüß≠

\hypertarget{study}{%
\subsection{Your future guidebook}\label{study}}

This guidebook to your future accompanies a course that has been co-designed by students for students, with input from academics and employers. It unites several disparate themes into one coherent story, from fundamental questions about identity and wellbeing through to more applied and practical advice on job hunting, career progression and life after University. Resources that do this are typically scattered around in many different places. There is usually no narrative to tie them all together to help students navigate the mountains of advice as embark on the first stages of their careers.

Although this is a course guidebook used in the second year undergraduate teaching, you don't need to be enrolled on the course to benefit from reading it, watching the videos and doing the exercises and coding challenges.

\hypertarget{updates}{%
\subsection{Your future is constantly updated}\label{updates}}

You are reading the alpha version, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product}{Minimum Viable Product} (MVP) of this guidebook. That's software engineer talk for saying it isn't finished yet. Subsequent versions, will be continuously and iteratively released on a daily and weekly basis. They will include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  More quizzes for better interactivity
\item
  More videos on the \href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLBv_u8JmyUPqmRALIjVnLg}{Coding your Future YouTube channel}
\item
  Audio podcasts in the \protect\hyperlink{listening}{Coding your Future}
\item
  More illustrations throughout the book
\item
  Improved content, finish incomplete chapters
\item
  Fix bugs and typos
\item
  Your \href{\%7B\#joinus\%7D}{suggestions for improvements and corrections, via github etc}
\end{itemize}

I'm taking a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often}{Release Early, Release Often} \citep{Raymond1999} approach to publishing this guidebook, you could call it agile book development. \citep{realagile}

\hypertarget{im-deliberately-writing-in-first-person-narrative}{%
\subsection{I'm deliberately writing in first person narrative}\label{im-deliberately-writing-in-first-person-narrative}}

A lot of scientific and technical writing is written in the third person or passive voice, which is fine for academic writing, but can alienate readers. I have opted to use first person narrative where possible as it is shorter, and hopefully more engaging for you to read. \citep{googler} Where relevant, I've told stories to illustrate key points.

\hypertarget{openaccess}{%
\subsection{Your future has no paywall}\label{openaccess}}

You don't need to pay anything to read this book online because its openly available, see the \protect\hyperlink{licensing}{license terms} (CC-BY-NC-ND). Publishing this guidebook online makes it findable and accessible, something that isn't true of lots of knowledge locked up inside other books.

Because this guidebook is online, it is searchable, browsable and linkable. You can link to whatever level you like, top level, chapter level and to every section and subsection level. Everything important has a Uniform Resource Locator (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL}{URL}).

\hypertarget{av}{%
\subsection{Audio and video}\label{av}}

This book is not just words and pictures, but includes audio and video as well, especially

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  videos produced by third parties that are worth watching
\item

I have tried to make this guidebook as engaging as possible. If you look at careers literature, a lot of it can unfortunately be rather dry, dull, textbooky and boring with little or no illustration. I've tried to make the content of this book as engaging as possible. If you think it can be improved, \protect\hyperlink{joinus}{let me know}. I always welcome constructive feedback, especially when it comes via a pull request.

\section{Signposts from here}\label{sign1}}

Each chapter in this book has a signposts section, highlighting key activities or reading you can do from here. This chapter has addressed the question of \textbf{why should you bother coding your future}? The answer is that your future is your responsibility and no-one elses. There are lots of people can help shape your future, but none more than yourself. Software engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin}{Robert C. Martin} argues this point in his book \emph{The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers}. \citep{cleancoder}

What's good about \emph{The Clean Coder} is that it is short (only 200 pages), well written and to the point. The main part of the book covers professional issues in software engineering, some of which I discuss in \protect\hyperlink{surviving}{your survival and promotion}, so \emph{The Clean Coder} is an essential signpost for chapter 10 as well.

\hypertarget{tldr1}{%
\section{Summarising this book}\label{tldr1}}

If all that was \href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn\%27t_read}{too long, didn't read} (TL;DR) for you, then you'll be relieved to hear that each chapter (including this one) has a TL;DR summary.

\end{figure}



The TL;DR for this chapter is, you should read this guidebook because it will help you design, build, test, debug and code your future in computing.

\hypertarget{knowing}{%
\chapter{Hello, who are you?}\label{knowing}}

Hello, who are you? What's your story? What are you good at, what do you like doing and what do you value? What are your hopes and dreams for the future? Tell me about your education and who you are. What unique talents are you finding and developing during your education? How are you striving to become the best possible version of you? üèÜ

\hypertarget{ilo2}{%
\section{What you will learn}\label{ilo2}}

Reading this chapter and doing the activities will help you to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Improve your self-awareness
\item
  Describe what you know: what is in your \textbf{head}, what have you done \textbf{hands} and outlining some of your values: what is in your \textbf{heart}
\item
  Identify your protected characteristics
\item
  Check and be grateful for any privileges that you may have
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{story}{%
\section{What's your story, coding glory?}\label{story}}

\begin{quote}
``If you are human, you love stories. Why? We're hardwired to love stories because they help us understand
our world and are essential to our evolution. We use stories to organise and communicate our surroundings
and our past, present and future'' ---Heather Box and Julian Mocine-McQueen \citep{freeyourstory}
\end{quote}

Self-awareness, understanding who you are, is important for leading a healthy and happy life, and likely to be an important factor in your future success. One way to develop self-awareness is to think about what your story is. \citep{freeyourstory} How did you get here, where are you going, what has inspired you? Who is the authentic you? \citep{regrets} What are your hopes and dreams? By starting to answer these questions you will gain a better understanding of who you are. This includes strengths, weaknesses, motivation and values. \citep{parachute2020}

Universities offer many opportunities for self improvement, self discovery and developing your unique skills. One way to build your self-awareness is to reflect on your knowledge, values and skills. In Waldorf education this is characterised as ``head, heart and hands''. \citep{headhearthands}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Head} What do you \emph{know}?
\item
  \textbf{Heart} What do you \emph{value}, what motivates you?
\item
  \textbf{Hands} What can you \emph{do}? What have you \emph{done} so far? What will you do in the future?
\end{enumerate}

Answering these questions will help you understand your story.

\hypertarget{no42}{%
\section{Ikigai: What is the meaning of life?}\label{no42}}

Many of the learning outcomes described above are non-trivial. You may have good self-awareness and be able to describe aspects of who you are in a matter of minutes. Other personality traits make take longer to realise. You can develop better self-awareness by describing four attributes shown in Figure \ref{fig:iki-fig}, together these are known as your ikigai (Áîü„ÅçÁî≤Êñê) or ``reason for being''.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  what do you love doing?
\item
  what are you good at?
\item
  what does the world need?
\item
  what can you be paid for?
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/ikigai}

\caption{Reasons for being, a concept in Japanese known as ``ikigai''. Image by Emmy van Deurzen on Wikimedia Commons. According to ikigai, a meaningful life combines doing four things. 1.

\end{figure}



You'll be lucky if you can find activities at the intersection of all four sets shown Figure \ref{fig:iki-fig}. In practice, you may realistically only be able to achieve one, two or three. That said, it's still a valuable exercise to think about what is in each category for you.

\hypertarget{self-assess-your-ikigai}{%
\section{Self assess your ikigai}\label{self-assess-your-ikigai}}

Take a sheet of paper, draw the four overlapping rings shown in Figure \ref{fig:iki-fig}, and spend five to ten minutes adding things in each ring.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What are your values?
\item
  What motivates you?
\item
  Are there things you like doing that you aren't particularly good at?
\item
  Why does that make them enjoyable?

\hypertarget{protected}{%
\section{Your protected characteristics}\label{protected}}

Some of your characteristics are protected. The Equality Act of 2010\footnote{\url{http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents}} protects you from discrimination at work or in education, based on what are known as ``protected characteristics''. \citep{equality}. This means that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Your \textbf{age} should not determine how you are treated
\item
  Your \textbf{disabilities} should not determine how you are treated
\item
  Your \textbf{gender} should not determine how you are treated \citep{inferior, damore, everydaysexism}
\item
  Your \textbf{gender re-assignment} should not determine how you are treated
\item
  Your \textbf{marriage} or civil partnership should not determine how you are treated
\item
  Your \textbf{pregnancy} and maternity should not determine how you are treated
\item
  Your \textbf{race} (including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin) should not determine how you are treated \citep{nottalking, superior}
\item
  Your \textbf{religion} or beliefs should not determine how you are treated
\item
  Your \textbf{sex} should not determine how you are treated \citep{harassment}
\item
  Your \textbf{sexual orientation} should not determine how you are treated \citep{nosex}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{goals}{%
\section{Coding challenges}\label{goals}}

This chapter has looked at some big issues around identity, by inviting you to think about some fundamental questions. Another way to think about these questions is as coding challenges. They are non-trivial questions to answer, it might take you weeks, months or even years to answer some of them. But they are worth spending time thinking about

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What are your values?
\item
  What makes you happy?
\item
  What do you want to get from your time at University?
\item
  What do you want after University?
\item
  Where do you see yourself in \emph{x} years time?
\end{itemize}

The signposts in the next section may help tackle some of these coding challenges.

\hypertarget{sign2}{%
\section{Signposts from here on identity}\label{sign2}}

This chapter challenges you to reflect on who you are and what you're good at. One of \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Top_Five_Regrets_of_the_Dying}{The Top Five Regrets of the Dying}} \citep{regrets} is that people wish they'd had the courage to live a life true to themselves, and not a life that others expected of them. Figuring out exactly who your authentic self is can be challenging. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronnie_Ware}{Bronnie Ware's} book might help, it has some very moving, personal and insightful true stories of peoples regrets that will illuminate your own values and might change your life. The top five regrets, outlined in the book and figure \ref{fig:bronnie-fig} are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me
\item
  I wish I hadn't worked so hard
\item
  I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings
\item
  I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends
\item
  I wish that I had let myself be happier
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.001\linewidth]{images/emptyFFFFFF-0} 

}

\caption{Palliative care nurse Bronnie Ware explains the top five regrets of the dying. Bronnie learned a lot from looking after people on their deathbeds, then wrote it all down in a fantastic book.}\label{fig:bronnie-fig}
\end{figure}

Since first being published in 1972, over ten million copies of \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Color_is_Your_Parachute\%3F}{What Color is Your Parachute?}} have been sold. It's has been translated into 20 languages and is used in 26 countries. What's good about \emph{Parachute} is that it has some useful \emph{self-inventory} exercises that go beyond the introductory ones in this guidebook, particularly in the context of your future career. While the style and examples can be U.S. centric, it's a classic self-help book that looks at a broad variety of issues around job hunting. The author, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nelson_Bolles}{Richard Nelson Bolles} was a chemical engineer and he explains how you can't possibly decide what to do in five years time in the video in figure \ref{fig:bolles-fig}. Where do you see yourself in five years time? is a question some interviewers like to ask.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.001\linewidth]{images/emptyFFFFFF-0} 

}

\caption{Where will you be five years from now? Best-selling author Dick Bolles talks at the Googleplex about the gaps between education and employment.}\label{fig:bolles-fig}
\end{figure}

A useful technique for developing self-awareness is to think about what your story is. Heather Box and Julian Mocine-McQueen's book \emph{How Your Story Sets You Free} \citep{freeyourstory} takes a storytelling approach to help you gain a better picture of who you are and what you value. What's good about this book is its short, less than 100 pages and contains practical exercises which extend those in this chapter.

Reflecting on your identity should lead you to check any privileges you might have. Being grateful for any privileges you may have is also beneficial for your mental health which we talk about in the chapter on \protect\hyperlink{wellbeing}{your well-being} So:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{If you're white} a good place to start understanding your white privileges is \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_I'm_No_Longer_Talking_to_White_People_About_Race}{Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race}} by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reni_Eddo-Lodge}{Reni Eddo Lodge} \citep{nottalking}
\item
  \textbf{If you're male} a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of being a man is \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_(book)}{Inferior}} by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Saini}{Angela Saini} \citep{inferior}
\item
  \textbf{If you're socially privileged} a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of your class is \emph{The Class Ceiling: Why it Pays to be Privileged} by Sam Friedman and Daniel Laurison \citep{classceiling}
\item
  \textbf{If you're heterosexual} a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of your sexual orientation is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Britton}{Ben Britton}'s presentation on \emph{No sexuality please, we're scientists} \citep{nosex} which covers bisexuality and homosexuality, including lesbian and gay.
\item
  \textbf{If you're gender binary} a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of being \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary}{gender binary} is Ben Britton's presentation \citep{nosex} which also covers transgender, genderqueer, non-binary and plus identities
\end{itemize}

There's a lot more to your identity than your race, class, gender and sexual orientation, see \protect\hyperlink{protected}{your protected characteristics}.

\hypertarget{tldr2}{%
\section{Summarising self awareness}\label{tldr2}}

\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn\%27t_read}{Too long, didn't read} (TL;DR)? Here's a summary:

This chapter has looked at who you are. Being self aware, understanding your strengths and weaknesses is key to getting what you want from your career. Questions about your identity are non-trivial, hopefully this chapter has started you thinking about who you are, what motivates you and what you want out of life.

These are fundamental design questions you'll need to address when you starting building your future. We touched on understanding any privileges you may have as being important for understanding who you are but also in being beneficial for your mental health.

In the next chapter, we'll look at mental health in more detail.

\hypertarget{wellbeing}{%
\chapter{Your well-being}\label{wellbeing}}

It doesn't matter if you are a student, an employee or even both at the same time. To be successful at studying or working, you need to take your well-being seriously. By well-being, I mean your health and happiness. Your health isn't just about your physical health but also your mental health and the two are very closely linked. It's all too easy when you are busy or stressed to neglect your well-being and then \textbf{bad-stuff‚Ñ¢} happens. This chapter looks at your well-being, and how you can nurture it. üòÄ

\hypertarget{ilo3}{%
\section{What you will learn}\label{ilo3}}

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify some of the symptoms of mental ill health in yourself and your peers, particularly anxiety and depression
\item
  Describe five self-help techniques for improving mental health
\item
  Describe services and other people you can approach if you (or someone you know) is being affected by mental ill health and self-help isn't enough
\item
  Schedule activities for improving mental and physical health into your daily or weekly routine
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{illhealth}{%
\section{Mental ill health}\label{illhealth}}

Stress can lead to many kinds of ill health. On describing his work for the government, Alan Turing said that:

\begin{quote}
I have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard; it's the only way I can get some release --Alan Turing's response on why he punished himself so much in training, as recounted by J F Harding, who was secretary of the Walton Athletic Club at the time \citep{kottke}
\end{quote}

University is a positive experience for many people, however like Alan, you may also experience periods of stress. This may also be accompanied by anxiety, loneliness and depression. Financial, social and academic pressures alongside concerns about employability and coronavirus can all have an impact on your wellbeing. Statistically, one in four of us will be affected by mental ill health during our lifetime. Two of the most common forms of mental ill health are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Anxiety}: \emph{persistent} feelings of unease, such as worry or fear
\item
  \textbf{Depression}: a low mood that \emph{lasts for a long time} and affects your everyday life
\end{itemize}

The \emph{persistent} and \emph{lasting a long time} are important here because while its part of the human condition to worry and feel low, that doesn't \emph{necessarily} mean you are affected by poor mental health.

\hypertarget{anxiety}{%
\subsection{Anxiety}\label{anxiety}}

Anxiety is one of most prevalent mental health disorders and can lead to depression, increased risk of suicide. Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), a common form of anxiety is explained in the video in Figure \ref{fig:anxious-fig} and at \href{https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder/}{nhs.uk/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder}. People who are affected by anxiety may struggle to function normally, and find routine everyday task difficult or impossible.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Generalised anxiety disorder is a condition characterised by excessive, persistent and unreasonable amounts of anxiety and worry about everyday things. You'll need to click through to youtube.com to watch the full video}\label{fig:anxious-fig}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{depression}{%
\subsection{Depression}\label{depression}}

Millions of people around the world live with depression. If you are affected by depression it can be really hard to talk about it as there are many social stigmas around mental health. Thankfully depression is largely preventable and treatable. Recognising depression and seeking help is the first and most critical step towards recovery. To mark \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day}{World Mental Health Day} writer and illustrator Matthew Johnstone tells the story of how he overcame the ``black dog of depression'' in the video in Figure \ref{fig:sad-fig} made in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO).

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{look-after-yourself}{%
\section{Look after yourself}\label{look-after-yourself}}

Looking after yourself can serve to both prevent and treat mental health issues that can affect you in life. You might be your own worst critic, or perhaps when you're under pressure you neglect things that are proven to be beneficial for your mental health, like sleep, exercise, mindfulness and friendship. Looking after yourself means at least three things:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  being mindful of your feelings and learning to ignore your inner critic
\item
  being kind to yourself in various ways
\item
  deliberately scheduling protected time to do the non-work things that matter.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}



Psychologist Laurie Santos describes five evidence-based strategies for coping when times are really challenging and tough in the video in figure \ref{fig:laurie-fig}. Those strategies are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Exercise: getting regular exercise improves both physical AND mental health.
\item
  Gratitude: research shows that being grateful can significantly improve your mental health. One way to do this is by keeping a gratitude journal, a log you fill in everyday of things you are grateful for (either small or big)
\item
  Sleep: actively developing healthier sleep patterns. Poor sleep hygiene can be both cause and effect of poor mental health. See the discussion of \emph{Why we sleep} \citep{whywesleep} in the \protect\hyperlink{signposts3}{signposts section below}
\item
  Get social: prioritise time with friends and family, rather than turning inward or diving deeper into work
\item
  Mindfulness: be mindful of emotions using the R.A.I.N. technique:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{R}ecognise: negative emotions
  \item
    \textbf{A}ccept: accept emotions rather than fighting them
  \item
    \textbf{I}nvestigate: notice how the emotion feels inside your body
  \item
    \textbf{N}urture: be kind to yourself
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Laurie explains the R.A.I.N. technique in figure \ref{fig:laurie-fig}.

\end{figure}



So there are things you can do to help yourself, but you may also need to seek help from others. Sometimes a desire to be productive by working hard has the opposite effect, because the sacrifices you make can be counter-productive.

\hypertarget{notalone}{%
\section{Help is available if you need it}\label{notalone}}

If you are affected by mental ill health, particularly anxiety or depression, it can be hard:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  to recognise that you need help in the first place
\item
  to help yourself using self-help resources
\item
  to ask others to help you
\end{itemize}

Even if you don't need help, its important to recognise and understand the symptoms of mental ill health. It's quite likely that someone you know will suffer from mental health issues and as their friend or peer, it might be you that can help by encouraging them to get the help they wouldn't otherwise ask for.

\textbf{You are not alone}, help is available if you (or your friends) need it from a wide variety of sources:

\hypertarget{your-university}{%
\subsection{Your University}\label{your-university}}

There are lots of people who can help you:

\item
  counselling services, for example contact \href{https://www.counsellingservice.manchester.ac.uk/}{counsellingservice.manchester.ac.uk}. The counselling service offers help on dealing with anxiety, depression, exam stress, confidence and other issues.
\item
  peers, flat-mates, family, friends etc. People close to you can help, although some people affected by mental health find it easier to discuss mental health with a trained professional or volunteer because of the social stigmas. There are lots of services outlined below that provide this kind of service.

\hypertarget{growthmindset}{%
\section{Developing a growth mindset}\label{growthmindset}}

Learning at University can be hard because you might have gone from being at (or near) the top of the class in high school to no longer being top of the class at University.

Likewise the \protect\hyperlink{searching}{job hunting we describe in the chapter on searching} can take a heavy toll on your mental health because repeated rejection is an ordinary part of the process. It can be time consuming, stressful and demoralising. You may find your applications disappear into a black hole. They will be ghosted (ignored) by employers. Interviewers will blank you and refuse to give you meaningful feedback because they're too busy. This could happen multiple times. This is all \emph{par for the course}, normal and expected, and is not necessarily a reflection on your abilities or potential.

Adopting a growth mindset can be a successful strategy for maintaining your wellbeing. If your grades aren't has good as you hoped or your search for employment is being met with repeated rejection, a growth mindset can help. Let's take rejection from potential employers as an example, there are two ways you can react to it:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Fixed mindset}}: responding with a fixed mindset will mean you are likely to take rejection personally. You might even assume that this confirms what you've always suspected. You're not good enough or that you made some fatal mistake in your applications or interviews. Ouch.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Growth mindset}}: by responding to rejection with a growth mindset, you focus on what happens next. Rejection is not failure but a ``not yet'' described in figure \ref{fig:not-fig}. Maybe you're not yet ready for that employer, but you'll definitely have a good idea of what you learned from the process and how can you do better next time.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/the-fixed-mindset} 

}

\caption{A fixed mindset is monolithic like the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moai}{Easter island statues}.

\end{figure}



According to Stanford psychologist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck}{Carol Dweck} we can all be placed on a spectrum according to where we think our abilities come from. At one end, the fixed mindset assumes all kinds of abilities are fixed traits while at the other end, a growth mindset assumes these abilities can be developed over time. \citep{dweck} There is good evidence to suggest that adopting a growth mindset will make you a better learner who can cope with the inevitable failures and rejections in life better. This approach can be used in a range of different disciplines such as learning programming languages \citep{Cutts2010}, music \citep{Davis2016} and job hunting.

\hypertarget{signposts3}{%
\section{Wellbeing signposts}\label{signposts3}}

This chapter has looked at your wellbeing and especially the role that both your mental health and physical health play in your future. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Haig}{Matt Haig}'s first-hand accounts of poor mental health will be comforting to anyone who is affected by mental ill health. Even if you're not affected, there is a 25\% chance you will do at some point in your life. There's also a high probability someone close to you will suffer from mental health issues. It might be a colleague, friend, family member, fellow student or partner, so it is worth educating yourself on the issues by reading his two short books:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Notes on a Nervous Planet} is a personal account of anxiety \citep{nervousplanet}
\item
  \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasons_to_Stay_Alive}{Reasons to Stay Alive}} is a personal account of depression \citep{stayalive}
\end{enumerate}

What's good about Matt Haig's books is they are quick and easy to read, but give plenty of first-hand insight into what mental ill-health can do to people (including you). Matt describes his top five tips for good mental health in figure \ref{fig:haig-fig}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.001\linewidth]{images/emptyFFFFFF-0} 

}

\caption{Two of Matt Haig's top five tips for good mental health include 1. Being more careful (and mindful) of social media and 2. Reading more books because books are good for your soul. Not just his book. Any book. Books are good for you. Trust me on this. \citep{bookfriends}}\label{fig:haig-fig}
\end{figure}



There's plenty of evidence to suggest that social media can have a detrimental effect on health. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier}{Jaron Lanier}'s skeptical polemic \emph{Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now} \citep{lanier} is a thought-provoking romp through some of the pitfalls of social media that may have you reaching for the delete or un-install button fairly quickly.

If all these books are making you sleepy, neuroscientist Matthew Walker's \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Sleep}{Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams}} may change your view on the importance of a good nights sleep. \citep{whywesleep}

Finally, it's well worth taking a look at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_R._Santos}{Laurie Santos} course on \emph{The Science of Wellbeing} (TSOWB) at \href{https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being}{coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being}. \citep{lauriesantos} TSOWB is the most popular course at Yale University and looks at some simple techniques you can use to improve your happiness. \citep{happinessny} The course will help you increase your happiness and build more productive habits. Using the latest research, Santos describes the misconceptions about happiness and ``annoying features'' of your mind that can impair your well-being. The course takes about 19 hours to complete but you can spread this over a whole semester (or longer) if you choose. The short clip in figure \ref{fig:laurie-fig} gives you a brief taster of Laurie's style and work.

\section{Summarising well-being}\label{tldr3}}

\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn\%27t_read}{Too long, didn't read} (TL;DR)? Here's a summary:

Anxiety and depression are serious conditions that are very likely to affect you or somebody close to you while you are at University. There's a one in four chance that you will be affected by mental health issues at some point in your life.

We've only talked about two particular mental health issues, anxiety and depression, but there are many other conditions such as phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, self-harm and more that are beyond the scope of this chapter. They do have one thing in common, and that is that talking about them is an important part of starting to develop better mental health.

If you are affected by mental ill health, talking about it is the first place to start, but often the hardest. In this chapter, I've outlined some ways you can help yourself alongside some of the services and people you can talk to if you need to. Despite how you might feel, you are not alone.

\hypertarget{communicating}{%
\chapter{Your soft skills are hard}\label{communicating}}

Let's get straight to the point of this chapter: your soft skills will take a \textbf{life time} to develop and are \textbf{really hard} use. Why? Because soft skills are about \emph{communicating} with and \emph{understanding} other people so that you can work \emph{together} as a team toward a shared goal. There are very few jobs where you work on your own, and most software and hardware is designed, built, tested and used by teams of people. Many of these teams are large and have very diverse membership. This means that sooner or later you're going to have to master the dark arts of working with other people by deploying your soft skills. üò±

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/What - other people}

\caption{Unless you want to be a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_keeper}{lighthouse keeper} on a remote island, there are very few jobs where you don't have to work as part of a team with other people.

\end{figure}



Communicating with other people and working in teams is inherently difficult because we're all human. There is good news and bad news\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{THE GOOD NEWS} is, people can be diligent, humble, competent, honest, caring and reliable. They can be co-operative, generous, supportive, kind, thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive, understanding and professional too!
\item
  \textbf{THE BAD NEWS} is, unfortunately people can also be lazy, stupid, ignorant, vain, incompetent, dishonest, unreliable, greedy, egomaniacal, unpredictable and moody. They can be proud, selfish, competitive, lustful, angry, envious, mean, busy, insensitive and thoughtless. Some may disagree with you, boss you around, betray, exploit, misunderstand and mislead you, deliberately or otherwise. \citep{sevendeadly}
\end{itemize}

So communicating with and understanding other people can be hard work, but don't worry, \textbf{everyone} finds this challenging, it's not just you! It doesn't matter if you're an extrovert or an introvert, we \emph{all} find communication difficult, and everyone can get better at it. This chapter takes a look at the softer skills and techniques you can use to improve your communication with other people, whatever mood they are in and whosever team they are on.

\hypertarget{computing-is-your-superpower}{%
\section{Computing is your superpower!}\label{computing-is-your-superpower}}

Studying computer science gives you an awesome superpower. We will look at some of the reasons why in the chapter on \protect\hyperlink{computing}{Computing your Future}. But for now, let us just acknowledge that hard technical skills like computing are highly sought after and valuable, both commercially and otherwise.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Achilles-Heel-to-Superpower} 

}

\caption{Computing is a superpower that gods like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes}{Hermes} and heroes like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles}{Achilles} would probably have envied. \citep{heroes} As a technical or ``hard skill'', computing a crucial weapon in your armoury but what are your weaker skills? What is your \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles\%27_heel}{Achilles' heel}? For some scientists and engineers, their weakness is their soft skills, such as communication and team work. This chapter looks at what you can do to improve them and convince employers that you are rounded individual with a healthy balance of soft and hard skills. \href{https://bryanmmathers.com/achilles-heel-to-superpower/}{Achilles heel to superpower} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/s}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:achilles-fig}
\end{figure}



Your computational superpower is less powerful if it isn't complemented by a broad range of softer skills. Typically, these skills are not emphasised (by repeated assessment) in most computer science degrees. This not because soft skills aren't important but because they are hard to measure accurately.

For example, if I want to know how good you are at understanding the syntax and semantics of a programming language like Python, there are tried and tested techniques for doing this. However, if I want to know how good you are at using your communication skills to work in a team, negotiate, lead, resolve conflicts, persuade others, show empathy etc that's \textbf{much} harder to measure accurately.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Hard and soft skills} 

}

\caption{Hard skills and soft skills aren't much use without each other. You will need both to survive and thrive but your most science and engineering education focuses on your hard skills, not your soft skills. Why? Because hard skills are often much easier to measure.

\end{figure}



Let's look at some of low-level communication skills (I/O) that they are built on.

\hypertarget{communication-i0}{%
\section{Communication I/0}\label{communication-i0}}

In terms of input and output, your fundamental communication skills are listening, speaking, reading and writing words in natural languages shown in table \ref{tab:iotable}. This might sound blindingly obvious, but these skills are often under-estimated or undervalued by engineers and scientists, especially undergraduates. Alongside verbal and written communication, there's also nonverbal language, or body language such as eye contact, gestures and facial expressions.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:iotable}Fundamental inputs of outputs of communication }
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lll}
\toprule
 & Input & Output\\
\midrule
Written natural language & Reading & Writing\\
Spoken natural language & Listening & Speaking\\
Nonverbal language & Observing other people & Being observed by others\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Engineers and scientists sometimes lack communication skills outlined in table \ref{tab:iotable}. Think of your stereotypical scientist, clad in a white coat, unable to explain the complexities of their subject to people outside their lab. Then there is the nerdy software engineer stereotype who prefers the company of computers to people. Yes, these are lazy and sometimes unhelpful stereotypes, but they express public perception of scientists and engineers as poor communicators.

\hypertarget{mightier}{%
\subsection{The pen is mightier than the sword}\label{mightier}}

The art of communication is a huge subject which extends far beyond the scope of this guidebook. So for the rest of this chapter, we'll focus on written communication skills because:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Good writing and reading are crucial in applications for employment and further study}: From writing CV's, covering letters, completing application forms and reading job specifications, and employer or course information, your ability to read and write natural languages is crucial to coding your future.
\item
  \textbf{Writing gets neglected}: Written communication skills (both reading and writing) are sometimes sidelined in science and engineering degrees. This is particularly true in the ``hard sciences''. For example, communicating and solving problems using code or mathematics are usually the dominant forms of assessment in computer science courses. That's understandable given the subject, but tends to push natural languages like english to the sidelines.
\item
  \textbf{Good engineers are also good writers} Many engineers (and scientists) could significantly improve their written communication skills. Software engineers are notoriously bad at writing good documentation, see for example \href{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/960492.960525}{Why Computer Science Students Need Language}, \emph{Scientists Must Write} \citep{scientistsmustwrite} and \href{https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-real-reason-silicon-valley-coders-write-bad-software/263377/}{The Real Reason Silicon Valley Coders Write Bad Software}, just three examples amongst many others making exactly the same point. Employers like Google provide training (and a whole career path) for technical writers, see \href{https://developers.google.com/tech-writing}{developers.google.com/tech-writing}. However, I'm arguing that these careers wouldn't be needed if software engineers were better at documenting, explaining and communication about their code in the first place!
\item
  \textbf{Writing good english is like writing good code}. Some of the skills you already have in coding can be transferred to written communication. Just like a good function or method in code should be well-defined with a clear purpose, your writing should also be clear and coherent. Well structured writing is a lot like well architected software too, with a clear \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns}{separation of concerns}
\item
  \textbf{It is relatively easy to improve} your written communication skills, simply by reading and writing more. Reading and writing deliberately every day, will significantly improve these skills.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{nle}{%
\subsection{Natural language engineering}\label{nle}}

If you stop to think about it, engineers and scientists spend a \emph{lot} time communicating in writing. As well as engineering code, they also spend a significant amount of time engineering messages in natural languages like english. Consider the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  email and instant messaging, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Zoom etc
\item
  bug reports and messages in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue-tracking_systems}{issue trackers} like Jira, BugZilla and Trello
\item
  `How to' and cookbook style articles and books
\item
  API reference material
\item
  Laboratory manuals and laboratory notebooks
\item
  The one page summary for management
\item
  User documentation, release notes
\item
  Case studies of software use
\item
  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
\item
  Posting on social media: LinkenIn, Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, blogs, Medium.com etc
\item
  YourPersonalDomain.com (if you have one)
\item
  Questions and answers on forums like \href{https://stackoverflow.com/}{stackoverflow.com}
\item
  Commit messages in version control systems like git and mercurial
\item
  Architecture documentation and design specifications
\end{itemize}

What do they all have in common? They're all written in natural languages like English, but without them, the software or hardware they describe and discuss would be useless.

\hypertarget{improving-your-written-communication}{%
\section{Improving your written communication}\label{improving-your-written-communication}}

Hopefully I've convinced you that written communication skills (both as a writer and reader) are important soft skills that engineers often neglect. So how can you improve?

\hypertarget{try-googles-tech-writing-course}{%
\subsection{Try Google's Tech Writing course}\label{try-googles-tech-writing-course}}

Google have developed some excellent technical writing courses including:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Technical Writing One: Technical Writing Fundamentals for Engineers \href{https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one}{developers.google.com/tech-writing/one}

Google occasionally delivers these technical writing courses as free sessions open to the general public. For details, see \href{https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/announcements}{developers.google.com/tech-writing/announcements} for details.

\hypertarget{deliberate-daily-writing}{%
\subsection{Deliberate daily writing}\label{deliberate-daily-writing}}

Another technique for improving your written communication is to write something every day, that might be a personal diary that only you read, or it could be something more public like blog or a gratitude journal. Schedule a time every day, say 15 to 30 minutes when you will do this without fail.

\hypertarget{deliberate-daily-reading}{%
\subsection{Deliberate daily reading}\label{deliberate-daily-reading}}

Reading other people's code will improve your software engineering skills. Likewise, reading other peoples writing will improve your natural language engineering skills. Read anything, it might be novels, magazines, newspapers, stuff online or any of the books cited in the \href{references.html}{references}. Find a time and place to do this every day and stick to it.

\hypertarget{dogfooding}{%
\subsection{Dogfooding}\label{dogfooding}}

Some companies test their products by trialling them on their own employees, this is sometimes known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food}{eating your own dogfood}. Tasty, tasty dogfood. üê∂

You can use a similar approach to testing your own writing, known simply as \textbf{Dogfooding}. Let's say you've just written a covering letter. It's natural to read it over in your head to check for errors, before you send it. However, \textbf{reading it aloud} will pick up errors you may not have spotted by reading silently. There's something about articulating words out loud that flushes out errors you don't pick up when you read them. This is a tried and tested technique. It also means you're ready to vocalise those answers in an interview.

You might want to choose carefully where you do this as it might look a bit strange, but it works well. If you talk into a mobile phone while looking at a piece of paper, people won't notice you're talking to yourself. But you'll probably need some privacy as the stuff you're talking about is likely to be personal.

\hypertarget{rtfm}{%
\subsection{Reading the friendly manual}\label{rtfm}}

You don't get good at communicating with computers (coding) by just \emph{writing} lots of code. You also need to \emph{read} other people's code too and be able to understand and modify it. Likewise, you don't get good at communicating with people by just \emph{writing} stuff in natural languages like english. You need to \emph{read} stuff too. Books, manuals, software documentation, articles, use cases etc. Reading this stuff will help you learn and you'll improve your written communication skills too. This sentiment is commonly expressed in Computer Science as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM}{read the friendly manual (RTFM)}, as shown in figure \ref{fig:rtfm-fig}

\begin{figure}

A big name on your CV early in your degree can help it stand out later, as fluff bucket demonstrates on their feline CV shown in \ref{fig:bigname-fig}. üòª

\begin{figure}

Other ways to get a big name on your CV include joining a big name competition or event, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Google has Code Jam, HashCode and Kick Start \href{https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/}{codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com} and Summer of Code \href{https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/}{summerofcode.withgoogle.com}
\item
  Facebook has hackathons \href{https://en-gb.facebook.com/hackathon}{facebook.com/hackathon}
\item
  Microsoft hosts the Imagine Cup \href{https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/}{imaginecup.microsoft.com}
\item
  There are many others like it listed at \href{https://devpost.com}{devpost.com} and Major League Hacking \href{https://mlh.io/}{mlh.io}
\end{itemize}

Big names look good on your CV, but they are not the only way to stand out.

\hypertarget{volunteering}{%
\subsection{Voluntary experience}\label{volunteering}}

Experience in the CV sense usually means paid work. However, experience in the context of \emph{are you experienced?} means anything where you can show you've been part of a bigger team, taken responsibility for something or tried to make the world a better place somehow. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Volunteering: Doing voluntary work is a good way to pick up new skills

\hypertarget{computing}{%
\chapter{Computing Your Future}\label{computing}}

It's difficult to think of any aspect of our lives that hasn't been changed by the invention of the digital computer, just 70 short years ago. Consequently, computing is a crucial skill in a wide range of careers across every sector of business and society. You don't have to have studied Computer Science at University to take advantage of all the exciting opportunities provided by computing. This chapter looks at some of those opportunities for those with, and without, degrees in Computer Science. üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

Reading this chapter and doing the activities will help you to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe why computing is a stimulating and challenging subject to study in its own right
\item
  Identify roles where studying computer science is relevant, beyond software engineering
\item
  Describe why NOT studying computer science doesn't necessarily ``lock you out'' of doing taking on some of these roles
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{copps}{%
\section{Computing: your future?}\label{copps}}

What role will computing play in your future career? A Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)}{Robert Sedgwick}, has, like many others, argued that Computer Science should be required of all students:

\begin{quote}
Every college student needs a computer science course, and most need two or more. More and more educators are
beginning to recognize this truth, but we are a long way from meeting the need. --Robert Sedgwick \citep{robertsedgwick}

Demand of software developers is high, on a par with teaching and nursing in terms of numbers.

\hypertarget{blackhole}{%
\section{Beware of the black hole}\label{blackhole}}

Before we get started, let's consider some advice from software engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell}{Gayle Laakmann McDowell} shown in figure \ref{fig:gayle-fig}. Gayle is an experienced software engineer who has worked at the biggest technology employers in the world, Apple, Microsoft and Google. She's also authored a cracking series of books on technology careers, particularly \emph{Cracking the Coding Interview} \citep{cracking} which we'll come across in the \href{interviewing.html}{chapter on interviewing}. Gayle refers to the employer ``black hole'':

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.28\linewidth]{images/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell} 

}

\caption{Beware of what software engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell}{Gayle Laakmaan McDowell} calls the employer ``Black Hole'', especially if you're applying to large employers.

\end{figure}



\begin{quote}
Getting through the doors, unfortunately, seems insurmountable. Hoards of candidates submit resumes each
year, with only a small fraction getting an interview. The online application system -- or, as it's more
appropriately nicknamed, ``The Black Hole,'' -- is littered with so many resumes that even a top candidate
would struggle to stand out. --\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell}{Gayle Laakman McDowell} \citep{blackhole, techcareer}
\end{quote}

If you're applying to big employers, you'll need to create a CV that is good enough to stand out in the black hole and persuade an employer to invite you to an interview. To get started, you will write this in an employer-agnostic way but you may need to come back and revisit the issues in this chapter once you have identified some target employers, so that you can customise and tailor your CV and written applications.

\hypertarget{its-not-bug-its-a-feature}{%
\section{It's not bug, its a feature}\label{its-not-bug-its-a-feature}}

It's an age old trope in Computer Science that engineers use to cover their mistakes, passing off their accidental bugs as deliberate features of their work:

\begin{quote}
``It's not a bug, it's a feature!'' ---A. Hacker \citep{bugorfeature}
\end{quote}

Nobody likes buggy software, but we unfortunately routinely tolerate badly-designed, low quality, bug-ridden software in our everyday lives. \citep{badsoftware, failware}

In contrast, buggy CVs are rarely tolerated, they will usually end up in the bin. Even a tiny defect, like an innocent typo, can be \sout{fetal} fatal. Most employers (particularly large and well known ones) have to triage hundreds or even thousands of CV's for any given vacancy. This means they are looking for reasons to REJECT your CV, rather than ACCEPT it, because that's a sensible strategy for shortlisting from a huge pool of candidates for interview. A buggy CV, application and covering letter could ruin your chances of being \protect\hyperlink{interviewing}{invited to an interview}.

Like writing software, the challenging part of writing a CV isn't the \emph{creation} but in the \emph{debugging}. Can you identify and fix the bugs before they are fatal?

\begin{quote}
DISCLAIMER: If you ask three people what they think of your CV, you will get three
different and probably contradictory opinions. CV's can be very subjective thing. The \textgreater{} advice below is based on common sense, experience and ongoing conversations with
employers. What makes a good CV will depend on the personal
preferences and prejudices of your reader. There are some general rules, which are
described below.
\end{quote}

While referring to this guide, remember that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The main purpose of your CV is to get an interview, not a job. Your CV should catch attention and provide talking points for an interview but not give your whole life story
\item
  Your CV will be assessed in seconds, rather than minutes so brevity really is key
\item
  Bullet points with \protect\hyperlink{verbsfirst}{verbs first} will:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    allow your reader to quickly scan your CV (\href{https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/how-people-read/}{employers don't read CVs, they scan them}) \citep{scanning}
  \item
    highlight your key activities
  \item
    avoid long sections of prose (which the reader will probably skip anyway)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{mycv}{%
\section{Is it a bug or a feature?}\label{mycv}}

Wherever criticism of your CV comes from, don't take it personally - it is probably one of the first you have written. Think of your current CV as an alpha or beta version that you continuously test, release and redeploy. There are many chances to debug and improve your CV during your study but before potential employers read it. The aim of this chapter is to help you improve your CV, whatever stage you are at. Employers often grumble that Computer Science graduates lack written communication skills. Written applications and CV's are a common example of this.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{EDUCATION}: Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) degree classification clear? Have you mentioned things you are studying now, not just courses you have finished? See \protect\hyperlink{mycved}{Education}
\item
  \textbf{STYLE}: Does it look good, decent layout, appropriate use of LaTeX or Word or whatever? Are there any spelling mistakes, typos and grammar? Don't just rely on a spellchecker, some typos can only be \sout{spitted} spotted by a human reader
\item
  \textbf{LENGTH}: Does it fit comfortably on (ideally) one page (for a R√©sum√©) or two pages (for a CV)? See \protect\hyperlink{length}{length}
\item
  \textbf{STRUCTURE}: Is the structure sensible? Is it in reverse chronological order? Most important (usually recent) things first? Not too many sections or anything missing? See \protect\hyperlink{mycvst}{structuring}
\item
  \textbf{VERBS FIRST}: Have you talked about what you have actually done using prominent \protect\hyperlink{verbsfirst}{verbs first} in bullets, rather than just what you think you know? Avoid long sections of prose.
\item
  \textbf{RESULTS}: Have you also demonstrated and \emph{quantified} the outcomes of your actions where possible, see \protect\hyperlink{carstart}{Context, Action \& Result (CAR)}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{mycvst}{%
\section{Structure your CV}\label{mycvst}}

How you structure your CV will depend on who you are and what your story is. Recruiters at Google suggest five sections, that follow a header section. Before we look at those, lets look at some general points about CVs, watch the videos shown in Figure \ref{fig:lopez-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.001\linewidth]{images/emptyFFFFFF-0} 

}

\caption{Recruiters at Google, \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-ong/}{Jeremy Ong} and \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizilopez/}{Lizi Lopez} outline some tips and advice for creating your resume.}\label{fig:lopez-fig}
\end{figure}



A key part of your story that you want to communicate in your CV is that you :

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  take responsibility
\item
  achieve things
\item
  are nice to have around
\end{enumerate}

How can you demonstrate this? Watch the short video in Figure \ref{fig:black-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.001\linewidth]{images/emptyFFFFFF-0} 

}

\caption{\href{https://twitter.com/jonathanpblack}{Jonathan Black}, head of the careers service at the University of Oxford, explains how to create a top notch CV. \citep{topnotchcv}}\label{fig:black-fig}
\end{figure}



\hypertarget{mycvpd}{%
\subsection{Your header}\label{mycvpd}}

The first thing in your CV is the header, a simple section giving your name, email, phone number and any links shown in the CV in Figure \ref{fig:turinghead-fig} for Alan Turing. That's it!

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/alan-turing-header} 

}

\caption{Keep the header of your CV simple. Just your name, email phone number and any relevant links are all you really need. Anything else, will just waste space and distract the reader.}\label{fig:turinghead-fig}
\end{figure}



Your header doesn't need to include any more information than your name, email, phone and any links. This means your birth date, marital status, photo and home address aren't relevant and you don't need to give multiple phone numbers or emails either, just one of each will do. If an employer wants to invite you to an interview, they'll get in touch by email, phone (or possibly LinkedIn) so other contact details are irrelevant at this point. After \protect\hyperlink{mycvpd}{your header} I suggest you have five sections that cover the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Education: the formal stuff üéì
\item
  Experience: paid work üí∞
\item
  Projects: side, social or University projects üí™
\item
  Activities and leadership üëë
\item
  Awards and honours üèÜ
\end{enumerate}

Let's look at each of these sections:

\hypertarget{mycved}{%
\subsection{Your education}\label{mycved}}

Unless you have significant amount of experience, the education section of your CV is likely to be the first real section, after the header. Your education section needs to strike a balance between:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Describing in enough detail what you've studied and any projects you've completed at University as part of your formal education
\item
  Keeping it short and sweet, without getting bogged down in the details.
\end{itemize}

You've invested a significant amount of time and money in getting your degree. At this stage, your degree justifies more description than a terse one line ``\emph{BSc Computer Science}''. You'll need to say more than \href{Penelope_Tester.pdf}{Pen Tester} and \href{Rick_Urshion.pdf}{Rick Urshion} (for example) but not as much as \href{Mike_Rokernel.pdf}{Mike Rokernel}, who has given \emph{way} too much information on his degree. You don't need to name every single module and give a mark for each. Neither do you need to give two decimal places (it happens). Pick out relevant modules, or the ones you got most out of. Employers like Google encourage applicants to emphasise courses on data structures and algorithms, but you'll need to tailor your description to the role and be brief. On a one page CV, you might only have two or three lines to describe your higher education.

\hypertarget{mycvex}{%
\subsection{Your experience}\label{mycvex}}

Experience is where you can talk about any paid or voluntary work experience you have. Don't discount casual labour, such as working in retail or hospitality, these demonstrate your work ethic and ability to deal with customers, often under pressure. You are more than just a techie, so anywhere you've worked in a team is experience worth mentioning, even if that team was just two people. Two people is still a team.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/What have you done} 

}

\caption{Are you experienced? What have you done? sketch by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:done-fig}
\end{figure}



If you don't have much experience, don't worry, there are plenty of opportunities to get some. For details, see \href{experiencing.html}{are you experienced}?

\hypertarget{mycvpj}{%
\subsection{Your projects}\label{mycvpj}}

The word ``Projects'' is a great catch all description for capturing all other things you get up to. This might include

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  personal side projects
\item
  social projects
\item
  University projects
\end{itemize}

They will most likely be unpaid because paid work fits better in \protect\hyperlink{mycvex}{your experience}. Perhaps you've completed some courses outside of your education such as a massive open online course (MOOC) or similar. Hackathons and competitions, fit well here too. \citep{hafb} You don't \emph{need} to have won any prizes or awards, although be sure to mention them if you have. Participating in hackathons and competitions clearly shows the reader that you enjoy learning new things. Demonstrating an appetite for new knowledge and skills will make your application stand out. If you're looking for some inspiration for side projects, Dani Stefanovic's \href{https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x}{build-your-own-x} repository is a good starting point. Building and creating new things is a great way to understand them, as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman}{Richard Feynman} once pointed out. \ref{fig:feynman-fig}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/feynman} 

}

\caption{Richard Feynman once chalked ``What I cannot create, I do not understand'' on his blackboard. Creating things in personal side projects are a great way to build new knowledge and help your CV stand out. Public domain image via Dani Stefanovic \href{https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x}{github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x}}\label{fig:feynman-fig}
\end{figure}



Another good source of projects is to \href{https://dev.to/rose/fixing-a-bug-on-my-open-source-project-from-start-to-finish-1749}{fix a bug in an open source project}. It might sound trivial, but fixing a bug demonstrates that you can collaborate with others, understand the toolchain being used (which might be complex) and solve problems.

If you've done group projects at University, be sure to mention them. Try to be \emph{more} descriptive than this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``First year team project''
\item
  ``Second year team project''
\item
  ``Final year project''
\end{itemize}

Those project names are pretty opaque and don't give the reader much to go on. What was the \protect\hyperlink{carstar}{context, action and result (CAR)} of the project? How many people were in your team? How long did you collaborate for? What did you build? What was it called? What did it do? What roles and responsibilities did you have in the team? Was their conflict in the team? How did you resolve it? How did you motivate the free-riders in the team to contribute?

\textbf{This is all excellent CV fodder!}

It's often a good idea to describe what YOU did before you describe what the software, hardware or project did. e.g.~reversing the order of this list emphasises what YOU did, rather than what the SOFTWARE did

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  WidgetWasher is a web service that takes random widgets and washes them before painting them a random colour and returning them to the client
\item
  Tested WidgetWasher on a range of different operating systems and devices
\item
  Designed and implemented the API which was build using a RESTful, pair programming with one other collaborator for two days at a hackathon
\end{itemize}

Your reader is likely to be more interested in what YOU did, rather than what the software (or hardware) that you built did. So in this example, I'd start with the verbs \emph{designed}, \emph{implemented}, \emph{tested} before saying what WidgetWasher

\hypertarget{mycvsk}{%
\subsection{Your skills?}\label{mycvsk}}

You may be tempted to dedicate a whole section on your CV to skills, particularly the technical ones. Maybe it makes you feel good listing them all in one place like a stamp collection. Don't do it! Why not? Let's imagine, that like \href{Rick_Urshion.pdf}{Rick Urshion}, you include Python in a long list skills, with its own dedicated section. There are at least four problems with Rick's not so skilful approach:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{No context} to give the reader an idea of the where he's developed or used his Python skills. Was it during his education, as a part of his work experience or his personal projects? We don't know because he doesn't say.
\item
  \textbf{No actions} or \emph{evidence} to back up his claims of having skill with Python. So Rick claims he knows Python. So what? What did he \emph{do} with those python skills? We don't know because he hasn't told us. Perhaps he DOES have Python skills, perhaps he DOESN'T. Is he telling lies and peddling fake news? It's difficult to tell.
\item
  \textbf{No results} given for what the outcome of using the skills was. Did he save his employers some money? Did he make something more efficient? Did he learn some methodology? We will never know.
\item
  \textbf{No tailoring} the skill to the job that he's applying for. Python would be valuable if he was applying to be a data scientist, software engineer, or automated tester but perhaps less relevant for a business analysis, consultancy, user experience or project management roles
\item
  \textbf{No story} told for that skill. This makes for a very dull and boring read. Yawn. Next!
\end{enumerate}

So, this doesn't mean Rick shouldn't mention his Python skills. He needs to give us the \protect\hyperlink{carstar}{context, action and result (CAR)}. This will make his pythonic story much more convincing and interesting to read. Giving the CAR will improve his chances of being invited to interview.

This applies to soft skills too, not just hard technical skills. Best to mention the context in which you've used any skills you mention on your CV. So, if you're going to have a skill section:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  keep it short (one or two lines maybe) but don't dedicate a whole section to it
\item
  stick to your strongest and most relevant skills that you are comfortable to answer questions on in your interview
\item
  Microsoft Office is \emph{not} generally a very interesting skill because everyone has it. Don't waste space talking about it unless you've done something very advanced with it, like some complicated integration with other software.
\end{itemize}

If you're a computer scientist, you also have demonstrable ``meta'' skills like the ability to learn things quickly. You can also think logically, reason, problem solve, analyse, generalise, criticise, decompose and abstract - often to tight deadlines. These \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking}{computational thinking} skills are future-proof and will last longer than whatever technology happens to be fashionable right now. Employers are often more interested in these ``meta'' capabilities and your potential than in any specific technical skills you may or may not have.

\hypertarget{birds-eye-view}{%
\section{Birds eye view}\label{birds-eye-view}}

Having looked at the sections you're likely to have, we'll take a birds eye view of your whole CV. The issues in this section apply to the whole of your CV, rather than individual sections.

\hypertarget{pdf}{%
\subsection{Your style}\label{pdf}}

Making your CV look good can take ages, but a well presented CV will stand out. While its worth making an effort to style carefully and consisistenly, you need to be be wary of the huge time sink of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography}{typography}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/CV need a little work} 

}

\caption{Does your CV need a little work? The truth is your CV is never finished, you will be continuously developing, debugging and releasing it throughout your life. It's such a crucial document because it will determine if you are interviewed, so its important to spend time getting it right.

\end{figure}



Whatever your typographical style is, portable document format (PDF) is the safest way to deliver it. It's called portable for a reason. While Microsoft Word is fine for editing, it is difficult to ensure that a Word document doesn't get mangled by transmission via the web or email. PDF is much safer, you can be more confident that it will work well on a range of different operating systems and devices. Try opening a Word document on any smartphone or tablet and you'll see what I mean. It helps if you can give the file a descriptive name so \texttt{ada\_lovelace.pdf} is a better filename than \texttt{my\_cv.pdf}

It's fine to author your CV in Microsoft Word, but you'll want to save as PDF to make it more platform independent. LaTeX and overleaf can be used to create professional PDFs and have many templates, see \href{https://latex4year1.netlify.app/}{Getting started with LaTeX: LaTeX4year1} if you've not used LaTeX before. \citep{latex4year1}

\hypertarget{carstar}{%
\subsection{Your context, action and results}\label{carstar}}

One way to structure descriptions of items within each section of your CV is to use \textbf{C}ontext, \textbf{A}ction and \textbf{R}esult (CAR) sometimes called STAR (\textbf{S}ituation \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}ction \textbf{R}esult). This method can also be useful for structuring answers to interview questions, especially if you get nervous. So for example, rather than just listing Python as a skill, you should tell the reader (really spell it out) more about the context in which you've used python, what you actually did with it and what the result was

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{CONTEXT}: So you've used Python, but in what context? As part of your education? For a personal project? As a volunteer? In a competition?
\item
  \textbf{ACTION}: What did you \emph{do} with Python? Did you use some particular library? Did you integrate or model something?
\item
  \textbf{RESULT}: What was the result and how can you measure it? You picked up some knew skills? You made something that was inefficient and awkward into something better, cheaper or faster?
\end{itemize}

Similar to CAR and STAR, recruiters at Google (see Figure \ref{fig:lopez-fig}) advise candidates to describe things using ``Accomplished {[}X{]}, as measured by {[}Y{]}, by doing {[}Z{]}''

So instead of saying

\begin{quote}
``generated reports for end users.'' -
\end{quote}

You could say

\begin{quote}
``Generated daily reconciliation report for team by automating workflow of 8 different tasks''
\end{quote}

The second is better because its more specific, captures the result (accomplishment), by quantifying it ( ``as measured by'') and talks about the actions (the doing part).

\hypertarget{length}{%
\subsection{Your length}\label{length}}

How long should your CV be? Many people start with a two page CV, which is a sensible starting point. It is also advisable to \href{https://www.cv-library.co.uk/career-advice/cv/how-long-cv-be/}{create a one page Resume}. \citep{howlong} At this stage in your career you should be able to fit everything on to one page. It can be challenging squeezing it all on:

\begin{quote}
``If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.'' ---Anon
\end{quote}

It takes more time to write less. Writing a one page resume is a valuable exercise, because it forces you to distill and edit out any filler or fluff, which you sometimes find on two page undergraduate or graduate CVs. It is much better to have a strong one-page resume than a weaker two-page CV that is padded out with filler to make up the space, as described in the video in figure \ref{fig:oneortwopager-fig}. Adding more features (pages and content) to your CV doesn't necessarily make it better. Sometimes adding more features to your CV will make it worse, as shown in figure \ref{fig:morefeatures-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/an-engineering-state-of-mind} 

}

\caption{If it ain't broke it doesn't have enough features yet. Adding more features to software doesn't necessarily make it better. Likewise, adding more pages and content to your CV or resume won't always improve it. It's often better to be precise and concise, rather than bloated and potentially more buggy. \href{https://bryanmmathers.com/an-engineering-state-of-mind/}{An engineering state of mind} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:morefeatures-fig}
\end{figure}



If you're struggling to fit all the information onto a one page resume, revisit each section and item carefully. Is there anything you can drop? Can you save a wasteful word here, or a lazy line there? Check for any spurious line breaks because every pixel counts. Don't throw your two page CV away, its a good store of stuff you might want to add to customised one-page resumes.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{verbsfirst}{%
\subsection{Verbs first}\label{verbsfirst}}

A simple but effective technique for emphasising what you have done, rather than just what you know, is to start the description of it with a verb. Employers don't just want to know what you know, but what you have actually done. So, for example, instead of saying e.g.

\begin{quote}
``In my second year CS29328 software engineering module I used Java, Eclipse and
JUnit to test and build an open source Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG)
\end{quote}

you could say:

\begin{quote}
``Built and tested a large open-source codebase using Eclipse, Ant, JUnit and Jenkins \ldots{}''
\end{quote}

followed by:

\begin{quote}
``Added and deployed new features to a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) in Java\ldots{}''
\end{quote}

The latter examples get to the point much quicker and avoid the problem of using ``I, me, my'' too much which can sound self-centred and egotistical. Although your CV is all about you so it is natural to have a few personal pronouns in there, but too many can look clumsy and give the wrong impression.

\hypertarget{links}{%
\subsection{Your links}\label{links}}

Augmenting your CV with web links (hyperlinks) adds context, without adding too many words or taking up valuable space. It's also a great way to add evidence that says things like:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{``Look at this thing I built, its really cool''}
\item
  \emph{``I was part a bigger thing you can find out about here''}
\item
  etc
\end{itemize}

Links are crucial features of your CV and an interested reader \emph{may} even follow them. Treat links with respect and they will support your goals and help your readers. Invest some time thinking about how you word the link text, and how they would be understood out of context. Make sure that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  hyperlinks are \href{https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/links/}{readable and descriptive} \citep{readable}\\
\item
  hyperlinks are clickable in the PDF. Don't make your reader cut and paste (or even type) URLs, they are too busy. If they are clickable, people are much more likely to follow them
\item
  hyperlinks are paper-proof. Some people still print CVs so the phrase ``click here'' won't work well on printed paper. See \href{https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140620-to-print-or-not-to-print}{to print or not to print --- a CV, that is} \citep{printcv}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/lovelace-linkedin} 

}

\caption{Adding links is a good way to augment your CV. If you're adding LinkedIn, make sure you \href{https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/topics/6042/6054/87}{customise your public profile URL}, to remove the default random alphanumeric string at the end, like the \texttt{038b37} example here. \citep{customlinkedin} You can also remove any ugly \texttt{http::}, forward slashes \texttt{//} and \texttt{www} in URLs which are distracting noise. Neither do you need to waste valuable space telling people what the link is, like in the first example, the domain name already tells you its a LinkedIn profile.}\label{fig:lovelace-fig}
\end{figure}



Besides LinkedIn you could include public profiles from \href{https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile}{github}, \href{https://medium.com/@rhamedy/contribution-debt-why-how-to-contribute-to-stack-overflow-a69d4bd50d0c}{stackoverflow}, \citep{stackoverflow} \href{https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021734632-Update-your-profile-and-username}{devpost}, \href{https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard}{hackerrank}. You can also link to personal projects or your blog if you have one. Obviously, you need to be careful about what you link to and what employers can find out about you online. They \emph{will} Google you. So keep it professional.

\hypertarget{robotproof}{%
\subsection{Robot proof your CV}\label{robotproof}}

It's a good idea get feedback from as many different sources as you can on your CV. By \emph{sources} I don't just mean humans, but also robots. Larger employers will use automated \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system}{Application Tracking Systems} (ATS) to log and trace your application. These ``resume robots'' (if you like) are unlikely to have arms and legs like the one in Figure \ref{fig:machines-fig}, but they \emph{will} be looking for keywords and standard headings in your CV. You can get automated feedback from a range of different automated systems, though it is a good idea to remove any personal information like phone numbers etc before using these free services. You might also want to check what the services privacy policy says about what they do with you data. Resume robots include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://careerset.io}{careerset.io}, a free service provided by a UK based company, careerset Ltd.
\item
  \href{https://resume.io}{resume.io}, a free service provided by a Dutch company, Imkey BV
\item
  \href{https://www.jobscan.co/}{jobscan.co}, a free service provided by an American company
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/The-inevitable-rise-of-the-machines-1280x720} 

}

\caption{Although they often struggle to get up the stairs and don't drive history the way humans do, resume robots are likely to play an important role in any decisions to invite you to a job interview, especially if you're applying to bigger companies. Make sure your CV is resume robot friendly by feeding it through a robot . \href{https://bryanmmathers.com/machines/}{Machines} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:machines-fig}
\end{figure}



Besides providing feedback on the content of your CV, using these systems can help address issues such as the use of tables or layout which may cause problems for some systems. For example, some systems ignore the second column of a two-column CV because they can't identify it. Some things to check with automated CV screens:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Have you used standard headings for the sections? Non-standard sections maybe ignored or misunderstood
\item
  Have you used appropriate verbs to describe your actions?
\item
  Is your layout and design robot friendly?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{referees}{%
\subsection{Your references}\label{referees}}

You might be tempted to put your referees details on your resume. Don't bother because;

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  references waste valuable space. You can say much more interesting things about yourself than who you referees are
\item
  references aren't needed in the early stages of a job application. They are typically taken up much later, when you've been offered or are about to be offered the job
\item
  references give personal information out. Do you really want to be giving personal details out to anyone that reads your CV? It could easily be misused.
\end{itemize}

It's not even worth saying ``references available on request'' - that just wastes space as well and is implied information on every CV anyway.

\hypertarget{discussion-points}{%
\section{Discussion points}\label{discussion-points}}

Some points for discussion:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How long should your CV be?
\item
  Should you have a personal statement on your CV?
\item
  One column or two column layout?
\item
  Should I put education or experience first?
\item
  How many of my hobbies and personal interests should I list?
\item
  How many employers actually read cover letters?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{checklist}{%
\section{Big Bad Buglist}\label{checklist}}

A quick check-list of commons bugs

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Has it been reviewed by several people?
\item
  Have you reviewed other people's CV's?
\item
  Does the style look good?
\item
  Is there too much or too little whitespace?
\item
  Is there anything irrelevant on there? e.g.~personal information, swimming certificates from ten years ago
\item
  Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) degree classification clear?
\item
  Are there any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors?
\item
  Is it in reverse chronological order?
\item
  Have you used too many personal pronouns?
\item
  Have you made it clear what you have actually done using prominent verbs?
\item
  Have you mentioned courses you are studying now (or next semester)?
\item
  Is it targeted to an employer or job description?
\item
  Is it balanced, with all non-technical
\item
  Does it have a good, clear structure? Typically education, experience, projects etc
\item
  Have you distinguished between paid and unpaid or voluntary work?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{covering-letters}{%
\section{Covering letters}\label{covering-letters}}

CV's are often accompanied by covering letters. Whereas your CV is just a bulleted list of facts and statements your CV gives you a chance to really demonstrate your written communication skills in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose}{prose} rather than short sharp facts. Lets say you're applying for a widget engineering position at BigWidget. There are three things you need to cover in approximately this order

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Why them? Why are you applying to Big Widget
\item
  Why widget engineering? There are lots of different roles at BigWidget, what is it about widget engineering that attracts you?
\item
  Why you? Why should they employ you, what makes you stand out from other candidates. What is your USP?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{elevatorpitch}{%
\subsection{Does anyone actually read covering letters?}\label{elevatorpitch}}

Some employers will read them carefully, some less so.

Even if nobody reads your covering letter, its still worth writing one because it forces you to rehearse standard interview questions shown above

\item
  Formulate job search strategies, by role, by sector and location
\item
  Describe the timing of recruitment cycles used by employers
\item
  Identify opportunities for finding work, online and face-to-face

\hypertarget{looking}{%
\section{Where can you for look for jobs?}\label{looking}}

The marketplace for job searching and job hunting advice is incredibly crowded. Employers spend huge amounts of money recruiting staff and this is reflected in the enormous range of job websites, which are often accompanied by advice on job hunting. I've broken resources down here into three categories:

\hypertarget{student-and-graduate-specific-resources}{%
\subsection{Student and graduate specific resources}\label{student-and-graduate-specific-resources}}

These resources are specifically aimed at undergraduate students and graduates:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{http://www.gradcracker.com/}{gradcracker.com} for engineering and technology students, you can filter e.g.~by \href{https://www.gradcracker.com/search/computing-technology/jobs}{Computing/Technology jobs}, from the publishers of the popular \href{http://www.gradcracker.com/career-centre/toolkit}{gradcracker toolkit}
\item
  \href{http://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/}{ratemyplacement.co.uk} is a leading UK job resource for undergraduates seeking placements and internships.
\item
  \href{http://www.targetjobs.co.uk/}{targetjobs.co.uk} graduate jobs, schemes and internships from the people behind \href{https://targetjobs.co.uk/uk300}{The Guardian 300 top graduate employers}

\item
  Your University careers service, e.g.~if you're studying at the University of Manchester it's \href{https://careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk/}{careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk}. University jobs boards are good places to look for opportunities that are specifically targeted at the University where you are studying
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{more-general-resources}{%
\subsection{More general resources}\label{more-general-resources}}

These resources are aimed at a wider audience (not just students and graduates) but are useful nonetheless.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Google job search aggregates content from many (\href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44853472}{but not all}) of the sources listed above. You can use google job search use to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven't used it already try the searches below. Unlike other sites, Google job search works by indexing embedded \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)}{microdata} based on \href{https://schema.org/JobPosting}{schema.org/JobPosting}. Keywords like \textbf{job}, \textbf{intern} or \textbf{placement} in a vanilla google search will trigger the job search product:

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{job-search-strategies}{%
\section{Job search strategies}\label{job-search-strategies}}

It is a good idea to have a range of different strategies for job hunting, and change the strategy during the year. Before we look at strategies, it's important to realise that when you're reading job descriptions for vacancies, some employers will over state their requirements in the hope they get their dream candidate. You might look at the job description and think, I've only got 70\% of what they're asking for, so I won't bother applying. The truth is, if you've got 75\% of what they are asking for, you should definitely apply.

\hypertarget{over-specified-jobs}{%
\subsection{Over specified jobs}\label{over-specified-jobs}}

Employers and recruiters routinely over-specify job descriptions. A good example of this is, when the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)}{Swift programming language} was released in 2014 at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference}{Apple Worldwide Developers Conference} (WWDC), job adverts instantly appeared asking for programmers with ``5 years experience in Swift''! How can anyone have five years experience in a programming language that's only just been made public? Aside from the people who developed the language, like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner}{Chris Lattner}, the employers are going to have long searching trying to find their candidate.

At the beginning of the academic year in September you might target large multinational organisations. If you're not successful, you can switch to smaller employers later in the academic year. Table \ref{tab:shortcuts} shows summarises some of the when and where some employers advertise.

\hypertarget{weakties}{%
\section{The power of weak ties}\label{weakties}}

Your close network probably won't change that much, the friends and family you trust and rely on. Its important to recognise the importance of more casual acquaintances, or what sociologist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter}{Mark Granovetter} calls ``weak ties''. \citep{granovetter}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/Bumped into} 

}

\caption{It's not what you know, its who you know. Networking is an essential part of any job search, your networks can help you now and in the future. One of the things looked at in this chapter is how to build and use your networks to help find the job you're after. The simplest networking technique is bumping into people, but you need create opportunities for that to happen.

\end{figure}



Weak ties are people you don't know as well, but are important for a range of reasons. Research has shown that \href{https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-why-your-weak-tie-friendships-may-mean-more-than-you-think}{building networks of weak ties is good for your mental health and can give you an edge in job hunting}. \citep{weakties} Granovetter showed that many job opportunities came through weak ties, rather than strong ones. This is true not just of jobs early on in your career (like now) but also later too. So it is in your interests to continually foster weak connections and be open to serendipitous meetings where you bump into people, as in Figure \ref{fig:bumped-fig}. ``Bumping into'' here, could mean either physical or virtual.

Congratulations, you've been invited to an interview. It might be a telephone, video or face-to-face, or it might even be as part of an assessment centre where you'll be asked to complete several other tasks and tests. Being invited to an interview means that your CV, along with any accompanying covering letters, application forms or digital portfolios, have hit the target. BULLSEYE! üéØ

\begin{figure}

If you've got an interview, you can feel good about having a bug-free CV shown in Figure \ref{fig:bugfree-fig}. But now you have a new set of problems. How can you prepare for the interview? What kinds of interviews exist and what questions might you be asked? If they offer you a job, how will you negotiate the terms, conditions and salary? Do you \emph{really} want the job anyway and are they the kind of people you actually want to work with everyday? You'll be giving this employer:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  most of the hours of your day
\item
  most of the days of your week
\item
  most of the weeks of your year
\item
  something like the next two years of your life \citep{jonathanblack} as the first part of you 80,000 hours

\section{Interviews}\label{interviews}}

Broadly speaking there are two basic kinds of interviews

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  technical or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_interview}{coding interview}
\item
  non-technical interview, sometimes called competency based interview
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{competency-interviews}{%
\section{Competency interviews}\label{competency-interviews}}

Competency interviews are there to test your soft skills, find out what you're like, how you work in a team, if you can communicate well. For more information on non-technical interviews see:

\end{itemize}

Since there's already tonnes of information The rest of this chapter will focus on technical interviews, also known as coding interviews.

\hypertarget{coding-interviews}{%
\section{Coding interviews}\label{coding-interviews}}

There are a lots of resources to help you prepare for and practice coding interview questions, the best place to start is \emph{Cracking the Coding Interview} by Gayle Laakmaan McDowell. \citep{cracking} As well as reading Gayle's book, there are lots of online resources to help you prepare for coding interviews. Before we look at those, University of Manchester Computer Science graduate Petia Davidova explains in figure \ref{fig:petia-fig} what she learned from failing several coding interviews at big technology companies. üò≠

Coding interviews can be tough, but preparing for them, and doing them will make you a better engineer. So if you spectacularly wipeout in your coding interview, reflect and think how can you improve next time? Perhaps you need to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Read up on some more data structures
\item
  Familiarise yourself with more algorithms
\item
  Practice thinking out loud (verbally) by doing a mock technical interview?
\end{itemize}

All of these things will help both your general professional development and your chances of success in future technical interviews.

\hypertarget{euler}{%

\chapter{Your survival \& promotion}\label{surviving}}

Congratulations, you've just accepted an offer of employment. You nailed that interview (or interviews) and you're just about to embark on the exciting journey from the world of study to the world of employment. This \emph{might} be your first SERIOUS job, so what do you need to survive? Even better, how can you thrive in your new role and take on the challenges that are coming your way? How will you optimise your trajectory to reach new heights? üöÄ

At the end of this chapter you will be able to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Survive in a workplace environment
\item
  Thrive in a workplace environment
\item
  Avoid diving in a workplace environment
\item
  Manage your manager
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{scenarios}{%
\section{Survive, thrive or dive?}\label{scenarios}}

Starting a new job is a bit like starting a new relationship. You've been through the courtship of recruitment, this might have been quick or may have had many rounds of first and second dates. Now you're both committed to each other and starting the relationship for real. Simply put, there are three scenarios for you as a new employee. You'll survive, thrive or dive.

\hypertarget{survive}{%
\subsection{Survive}\label{survive}}

It will go OK, you'll meet the expectations of your employer and become and valued employee. Most employees fit in to this category. üÜó

\hypertarget{thrive}{%
\subsection{Thrive}\label{thrive}}

It will go brilliantly, you'll exceed the expectations of your employer. If you're on a fixed term contract, such as a summer internship or year long placement, they'll make you a job offer during or soon after your contract of employment expires. If you're on a more permanent contract, such as a graduate job or graduate scheme you'll be promoted and given more responsibility. üí™

You're doing really well if you can impress your manager. Some lucky people make it into this category.

\hypertarget{dive}{%
\subsection{Dive}\label{dive}}

It will go badly, you will struggle to fit in and won't meet the expectations of your employer. You were \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-crossed}{star-crossed lovers}, but the relationship has turned sour. There are several ways that you might breakup with (or be dumped by) your estranged lover. üíî

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If things get really bad, your employer may \href{https://www.gov.uk/disciplinary-procedures-and-action-at-work}{take disciplinary action against you} \citep{dive} and in the worst case scenario, you'll be \href{https://www.gov.uk/dismissal}{fired (dismissed)}. \citep{yourefired}
\item
  Alternatively, you might decide to you want to \href{https://www.gov.uk/handing-in-your-notice}{hand in your notice} to terminate your contract of employment and leave. \citep{iquit}
\end{itemize}

Dismissal is rare, but it \textbf{does} happen, even to interns and placement students. In this scenario in the UK, the employer has a duty to do everything they reasonably can to prevent this from happening. It's not your employers interests to fire you because they've invested a lot of time and money in you by this point. If they have sensible recruitment procedures, those procedures will root out unsuitable candidates long before they make it to the workplace where they can cause real and lasting damage to the organisation once in post.

Do you feel like the \emph{weird edge case} pictured in Figure \ref{fig:default-user-fig}? Do typical graduate destinations such as large multi-national corporations, not really make you want to \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_Your_Thang}{Shake Your Thang}}? \citep{saltnpepa} Perhaps you want to use your technical skills responsibly and ethically to make the world a better place? Or maybe you want to start your own business and make money for yourself, rather than other people? This chapter on your alternatives will broaden your horizons and get you to think about some of the less obvious options, because I \emph{love} weird edge cases and you should too. üòª

Many technology jobs exist outside of technology companies, \citep{outsideit} because a lot of software is written to be used rather than sold. Consequently, many employers create bespoke software to fit their own business needs. The people who build are often employees that given organisation, rather than people employed by a technology company. In the United States for example, ninety percent of IT jobs are outside the traditional tech industry. Technical jobs outside the technology sector often have the advantage of being more accessible than those within a very competitive technology sector. \citep{burninglass}

\chapter{Ten Simple Rules}\label{ruling}}

In 2005, the scientist and engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Bourne}{Phil Bourne} starting publishing a series of articles which distilled people's hard won knowledge into a series \emph{\href{https://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules}{Ten Simple Rules}}.\citep{Bourne2005} Over a decade more than 1000 rules were published in over 100 articles in the scientific journal \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_Computational_Biology}{PLOS Computational Biology}}. \citep{Bourne2018} These articles offer a huge range of advice from making the most of a summer internship \citep{Aicher2017} to considering life outside academia \citep{Searls2009} and even (tongue-in-cheek) winning a Nobel Prize. \citep{Roberts2015} Articles as lists, or ``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle}{listicles}'' as they are sometimes known, are a convenient way to summarise key points. So here are Ten Simple Rules for Coding Your Future: the too long, didn't read (TL;DR) for this guidebook.

\hypertarget{mybrand}{%

There is a lot more to you than your degree. Yes, you've spent three or four years getting your degree. identify your weaknesses and work out how to improve them.

\hypertarget{onlyhuman}{%
\section{Look after yourself}\label{onlyhuman}}

Look after yourself mentally and physically.

Choose your reference points carefully, try not to compare yourself to the person at the top of the class. Ask yourself, am I doing better than last time?

\hypertarget{gregwilson}{%
\section{Use what you have}\label{gregwilson}}

This rule is borrowed from software engineer Greg Wilson \href{https://github.com/gvwilson}{@gvwilson}, who probably adapted it from a quote frequently misattributed to President Theodore Roosevelt \citep{teddy}. The full quote is

\begin{quote}
Start where you are, use what you have, help who you can, see \url{https://third-bit.com}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{network}{%
\section{Build your network}\label{network}}

Build your network, use all the people you can. Remember that the weaker ties in your network may be more important than your stronger ties, especially when it comes to finding jobs.

It's not what you know, its who you know.

\hypertarget{estherdyson}{%
\section{Always make new mistakes}\label{estherdyson}}

You can classify your mistakes and failures into two categories:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Productive mistakes: those you learnt from
\item
  Unproductive mistakes: those you didn't learn anything from and risk repeating
\end{enumerate}

Mistakes and failure are inevitable in life, but productive mistakes are going to help you much more that unproductive ones \citep{henrypetroski}. That doesn't just mean you should ``fail fast, fail often'' \citep{failfast} or ``move fast and break things'', but to conciously learn from any mistakes you make so that you don't repeat them. One way to turn unproductive mistakes into productive ones is deliberately and conciously reflect on why you made them. This is part of the growth mindset we discussed in the chapter on \protect\hyperlink{wellbeing}{your well-being}.

In a growth mindset, mistakes can be good, but the fear of making them is not. You are more likely to take more chances when you're unafraid to fail, and this will improve your chances of success.

Many education systems around the world don't teach people how to fail, because they put too much emphasis on success (top grades) rather than progress and learning. \citep{failgift} So as Ester Dyson says,

Always make new mistakes

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you've got some harsh feedback on your CV, how can you make less buggy in the future?
\item
  If you've applied to lots of companies and not even had a reply yet, how you improve your job search strategy?
\item
  If you've neglected to develop interests and projects outside of work, how can you rebalance?
\item
  If you crashed and burned in an interview, how can you use the experience to do better next time?
\item
  If you failed to get the promotion you thought you deserved, what will you do differently in the future
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{gratitude}{%
\section{Help and thank who you can}\label{gratitude}}

There are good reasons to be grateful, showing gratitude doesn't just help other people, it helps you too.

Join a team by helping someone, be a team player, help others, thank others for their help.

\hypertarget{beyond}{%
\section{Look beyond the obvious}\label{beyond}}

Be flexible in approach. Not just big employers, there are startups, SME's you've never heard of. It's not just London, and other big cities. Look beyond graduate schemes, look beyond graduate jobs.

You are not just a techie, Either.

\hypertarget{lifelonglearning}{%
\section{Stay in school}\label{lifelonglearning}}

Never stop learning.

\hypertarget{comfy}{%
\section{Step outside your comfort zone}\label{comfy}}

Am I being insensitive asking people to step outside their comfort zone when we've all be stretched beyond breaking point during COVID-19?

We're going to need to continue to step outside of our respective comfort zones in order to meet the challenges we face around the world.

This takes courage, but that's often when you learn most. So step outside your comfort zone if you're feeling brave enough to learn.

\hypertarget{nevergiveup}{%

\chapter{Not Just London}\label{notjustlondon}}

A simple way to improve your job prospects is to \href{searching.html}{broaden and deepen your job search}. One of the \href{ruling.html}{ten simple rules for coding your future}, is to look beyond obvious employers and locations for jobs and \href{broadening.html}{consider all the alternatives}.

For example, if you're seeking work or further study in the United Kingdom, there are lots of possibilities in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxbridge}{Loxbridge} (London, Oxford and Cambridge). While Loxbridge undoubtedly offers many fantastic opportunities for professional growth and development, it does not represent \emph{all} of the best opportunities that exist in the UK.

So, it's wrong to assume that capital cities like London are where \emph{all} the best opportunities are. That's true in the UK and also in many other countries too.

There are clearly some fantastic employers offering great opportunities in London but they do not represent everything that is on offer in the UK. There are plenty of good career options outside of capital cities like London if you don't want to live and work in a huge metropolis.
