# (PART) BUILDING YOUR FUTURE {-}

# Organising your future {#organising}
You might find it a bit scary thinking about your future. You might be tempted to procrastinate making important decisions about your future, see figure \@ref(fig:schedule-fig). There is a risk of [thrashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)) or getting stuck in a `do-nothing` or [`busy waiting`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting) loop. This guidebook is here to help you break out of that loop. One way to breakout of an unproductive loop is to organise and schedule some time every week where you work on personal development and job applications. Doing good applications takes time and you'll probably find you can't do as many applications as you might like, especially when you consider [Hofstadter's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law): It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

(ref:captionschedule) The biggest waste of time is the time spent not getting started on a project. Your future might seem big and unknown but it's really not as scary as you might think and getting started can be surprisingly enjoyable. [New Project?

Your future is bright, your future needs organising, so let's start organising your future.

## Building your future {#make}
In section \@ref(by-quantity) and \@ref(by-quantity) we discussed the importance of timing in your job search. *When* you apply for jobs will determine *what* kind of jobs are available because most graduate schemes and graduate jobs follow a rhythmic recruitment cycle of some kind. How many jobs you apply for is largely a function of how much time you spend doing it. The more time you spend, the more applications you can do.

We haven't explicitly discussed the timing and organisation of the activities outlined in the preceding chapters:

1. *Designing your Future* in chapters \@ref(rebooting) to \@ref(computing)
1. *Testing your Future* in chapters \@ref(debugging) to \@ref(speaking)

Let's imagine you could precisely specify all of the tests using [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) in a `makefile` or specify them somehow in your favourite Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Ideally, you'd like to automatically run these tests, so that you can build your future systematically. You'd like to repeat these tests periodically, e.g. once a day, week, month or whatever your schedule is, similar to [build automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation) in software engineering. Attempts to automate aspects of job applications and interviews have so far had very mixed results. [@airesume; @dastinai] But, as another thought experiment, let's image it was possible

* So what's in your make file?

## Scheduling your future {#scheduling}

If you're a University of Manchester student, the live *Coding your Future* (COMP2CARS) workshops sessions are also here to help, every Tuesday at 4pm.  COMP2CARS complements the second year tutorials (COMP2TUT) at the University of Manchester and takes place in the same slot as COMP2TUT when you meet your personal tutor. See your timetable at [timetables.manchester.ac.uk](https://timetables.manchester.ac.uk/). The outline is:
