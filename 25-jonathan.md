So let's start the beginning and what your name and where you come from. Um yeah so I'm I'm Jonathan born and raised in Manchester so I'm didn't have to to come very far today. The moment I'm I'm in Salvage. So you know a little bit cheaper, Can you say?

Yeah. So you local and he said what was it that made use choose to study computer science? Can you remember was it a particular moment or was it something over time? Did you did you study it as an A level or as a GCSE or So, it wasn't there wasn't like one moment really?

Well, I went like computer sciences isn't is the thing for me. Something I've always kind of done and it was this, a sort of going into university was almost this transition from it, being a thing, I've done on the side as more of a hobby, like, say overengineering, Excel.

Spreadsheets that sort of thing to. Okay? Now it's actually do it. Seriously, that was really the difference there. And so choosing to do computer, science was just kind of this natural thing. It just made sense, it was the thing. I've always been doing so much of anyway, right? So, I guess, did you do computing as an A level or a GCSE?

Or was it something? So at college, I studied engineering. I went to a university to technical college. Right in is that immediate the not the one in Salford. So the, the one I went to was in Oldham, it's now closed down. I think the, the students they would targeting was wasn't quite what they, what they're after because universities at university, technical colleges target, like years, 10 and 11, and then in college 12 and 13.

Yeah. And it just didn't quite work for them with like the VA's 10 in 11 and it made it very difficult for them to, to run the college, right? Okay, yeah. So so you arrived in Manchester, what? He graduate 2020, so you're right in 2016? Yes, that's right. Ancient history now going by that far but and you arrived in your first year.

I think and you were saying earlier in your first year, you've got managed to get summer internship after your first year which is yes, pretty good going. So how did you go about getting that summer internship? And Yeah. So the summer internship, I was at a was a meetup and was talking to talking to the I suppose a CEO of a of a startup and sort of hated off from there.

I liked the the kind of thing that they were that they were doing. They were all about sort of helping people find find mentors and helping people sort of get into the industry, especially people from like disadvantaged backgrounds and was all about helping without sort of stuff. And with that being the, the goal for my to be the the company it also turned out, they were more than willing to take a risk on them on a student.

I didn't have loads of experience to yeah, help them get that experience. I think, did they was there something where they didn't really have? It was a sort of ad hoc thing. So like is a sort of the classic perhaps a hidden job, where it wasn't. Oh, this company are looking for this student, who knows about JavaScript.

It was a you bumped into somebody a JavaScript meetup. Is that right? And then you you got talking and it turns out oh actually, yeah, we've been interested in taking on a summer student. So this kind of I think people often say this is come there's lots of hidden jobs out there that don't always get advertised.

It sound, does it sound like a little bit like that? Is it? So potentially something that had you looked for it online. You would never have found it because it probably wasn't advertised. Yeah, exactly. That both my are both my placement year and my my summer internship, were those hidden jobs.

I don't even think that, you know, the people that were offered me the job, but actually plans to, to do so in in the first place and it's for better or worse, one of the things you might hear a lot is that. It's, it's who, you know, not not what you know, and it's just being in the right place the right time and making those connections and sort of being being personable and being friendly.

It matters heck of a lot. Yeah. Yeah. And just being open to sort of bumping into people I guess because you never know. I mean some people have social networks that they can plug into already but quite often the people who can influence your career, the most are actually people on the edge if your network that perhaps you don't know so well or you just bumped into somewhere.

So so that was in first, you came back to your second year and you did. You want to do a year-long placement? Yes. From the beginning. So you kind of knew that's what you wanted to do. But now you've already got somewhere internship under your belt. So what's our place, what can you describe sort of journey in second years as lots of work to do in a second year and but what your journey was from, you know, beginning of the year to then getting this placement at it was money.

Supermarket was always, it was so many supermarket. Yeah, so there was a few different places. I I sort of applied to in the end, choosing money supermarket, despite it not being one of the places I originally intended to to apply to one of the places was a was an agency and in the end, it just seems the second digital agency and sort of digital marketing quite a lot of digital marketing type companies in Manchester that.

Do that kind of? Yeah, would you mean an agency? Hasn't like a recruitment agency. And it was, they, Um, so I've hired's, I suppose not quite contractors but would sort of in the, in the market just building like digital products for people. Yeah, and I chose in the end to not, not to go with them and, and go with many supermarkets because of the the connections that I made with them.

Some of the people that are in sort of knowing a little bit more like what money supermarket was about before joining them, which I think was definitely the the best idea then because if I remember correctly, a few months after there was a news article going around and this company that I was looking to apply to that, I didn't wasn't doing so well.

Not not too long afterwards. Yeah, I mean it's a kind of there. That's the startup. I'm gonna get some with the third, your summer internship, was kind of startup. That's always a bit of a risk is now it's exciting because you, you know, you it's five people or whatever it is and get to learn lots, but that's not downside of.

That is sometimes it can all go a bit better. Yeah. You end up with no job and so money. Supermarket's quite a big brand. I is a very professional and nice big team and you kind of get an idea of what the culture is like from meeting people before or during the interview.

Yeah. So what were you? What were you, what was your role at money supermarket? And yeah, how many supermarket I was I was an Android developer, right? So at the time there was like this big sort of branding transition. I'm so there was a couple of apps that they were working on the same time.

I think some of the work was contracted out to like a separate company but with many supermarket, I was one of the the in-house staff for for the year helping them sort of maintain and bring new features to to the current app that they sort of had front and centre the team.

I was on the mobile app team, I think was around 40 people or something like that. But as far as like Androids developers go and there was maybe like half a dozen of us that new Android. I think another like half a dozen that for focus, more on air more on iOS, right?

Yeah, So actually, Mr. Learned, a lot of hell, a lot about engineering doing live products that, you know, it's in, it's really important that it works. Well, you've tested all your code before it gets deployed to production, all that kind of stuff. So apart from the technical stuff, all sort of main sort of things that you felt that you learnt from doing your placement at money supermarket.

Um, that's an interesting one. So As far as the stuff I'd learnt, there's so much that you can get from a particular technology or you know, thing, you're you're working with. That can be, that can be transferred. So, I mean, I was working on on Android development at the time.

I haven't touched Android development since then. Okay. But all of the, the sort of processes and we had the process, the way of working. That's all stuff that can absolutely just be lifted and shifted and all applied somewhere else. So choosing to, to learn a particular framework or piece of technology, even if that piece of technology ceases to exist, it's not wasted time.

Because what tends to happen in in the industry, is everyone likes to reinvent the wheel, it just looks slightly different every time and so if you've learnt the technology, you know, years in the past you'll find it'll be there'll be a cycle and things will move a little bit further away from that way of working and then it'll cycle all the way back around.

And you'll have seen this thing before. And great. You'll be able to hit the ground running with it because it's stuff, you've already seen. Yeah, good. And so you can you describe it? But did you face any obstacles in finding, you know, what was the, what was them? And it sounds like you were.

You're doing really well because you would some exploiting your network and, you know, putting feelers out there to try and find a meet people. But what were the did you face any barriers that, you know, were challenging we're in second year when you were looking for jobs. Mm-hmm. And you know, how did you overcome them?

Yeah. So As far as like difficulties getting a placement, I think I face the same sort of thing about like a lot of people have where at first I was applying to a lot of places a load of rejections and that that happens. It doesn't matter how good you are.

You're applying a place you end up getting rejected by most of them, it happens. There's a lot of people going for the same jobs and in the end getting a job that wasn't even advertised in the first place by going there. Going to meet up, not particularly looking for a job.

But deciding, I want to get some free pizza because this meets up is offering free, pizza student. What can I say? You know, works every time happy? Absolutely. Yeah, I don't even think, if I'm totally honest, I don't even think I was actually paying that much attention to the talk.

I was more just, I'm gonna sit here on my laptop, and I don't know if it was university worker side projects or whatever. At times, gonna do some work on my own, and just get the pizza. And just if there's anything interested in the top, maybe I'll I'll look up and pay a little bit of attention, but yeah.

In the ends, like, um, it was much easier talking to people. Did you go on your own, or did you take to go with a with somebody? So, I mean, that's, that's something that's quite can be quite daunted for students. If you're going to a meet up, it can be Sometimes a bit intimidating because you're, you might be the least experienced person there.

Even though you've been studying for a while, and you've done lots of stuff on your own. You're, it's kind of sometimes a bit intimidating. Although having said that, I think those kinds of events tend to be full of quite friendly. Personable people so it is quite easy just to walk up to strangers and go Bye.

Who are you? What are you doing? Kind of thing. So I have lost my train of thought I so and you that's that's what you were doing, I guess. Yeah yeah. And if you're a student you are the least experience in the room. There's no there's no question about that.

I can still go to these events and their B people that I've sort of been in the industry for decades and so much experience and about like up just follow some of the stuff that I talk about some of the stuff that they've seen. And you know, that's all experience that can be learnt from and that's great.

It is a little bit intimidating at first and the great thing about these meetups is you can go for a little while if it's something that's a little bit uncomfortable. It's okay to leave. It's okay. Not for the full thing and it will be scary and some of them will be boring.

All of them will be great and that's fine. It happens. Turn up to one of the ones with pizza and at least you know you don't leave with nothing. There was you know if you haven't understood at all, you could still talk to people afterwards and the network of you know the professional network that you build can be valuable that ways.

Oh absolutely. Yeah, yeah. Even if it's something that you're not hugely interested in, there's still so many people there that are in that are doing things much more similar to you, maybe things that much more interesting to you and so if you end up at a talk that you think is about databases and it turns out to be about data and business analysis.

And you realise, I've really ended up in the wrong like GDPR and the meetup, then at least you can get your pizza. Have a look at have a couple of interesting conversations and just yeah, disappeared into the background. It's fine. Good. Okay. So that was your placement year and money so you might you came back into your funnier.

Can you remember? I know it's two years ago now. But lots happened into this. Yeah. And can you remember what you did? What did you do for your final year project? Yeah, so my my final year project was um kind of an extension in a way, some of this technologies I had seen money supermarket and not really dugma teeth into that.

I was looking at Kubernetes which is a way of orchestrating, a bunch of of different applications. Running simultaneously in much more of a an enterprise fashion and compared to say, running a bunch of like, Java application on say like a raspberry Pi or something like that. And the idea was to so apply a lot of the stuff I got from industry and lots of that I've learnt from from software engineering in the second year and sort of evaluating those technologies looking at the thing that I could build with those sorts technologies and build a like a white label sort of e-commerce platform, right?

That was the that was yeah that was the goal was kind of I suppose a nice thing about a final year project is you can you don't have to worry too much about the customer because there isn't well and I guess read by an academic but you can sort of just dig into stuff because it's interesting and that's let's see where this goes.

Let's see what I can do with this kind of thing and so say it's a safe way to take risks. Yeah, yeah. And that's not always possible to do that in a commercial environment because as usually a customer or somebody that's like yeah, can you stop working on that now and do this thing over here instead?

Yeah, and so that's graduation two years ago and I think you went so your way of working you way. You're working now is where you where you work to immediately after you started universities. Yes, it's infinity where it's can you tell us the stuff that you can talk about?

So infinity works is who are infinity works. Yes. So so infinity works are one of the few companies now are inspire Accenture. They do software software consulting So rather than explained sort of what software consorting is. Maybe I'll go through sort of what I do there which would be similar to I suppose if someone joined and the kind of stuff and that the expecting.

So I'm basically attached to two different companies and they'll have problems or challenges that there that they're looking to overcome. These are clients of infinity works. Yes, exactly. So with it with a team of people from from Infinityworks, usually, sometimes it'll be a team that's like just infinity work staff and it'll be the whole team.

So, of sits with the client other times, they sort of take and people's of more as individuals or much smaller teams. Maybe like one or two people will go and sit with the client and help them develop what development, a product improve and tweak the ways they're working to.

I mean, ultimately to, to end up making more money turned up creating stuff more efficiently to to getting rid of roadblocks, that's that sort of thing. So working with people quite a lot. So no. I mean there's a and what's the word misconception with computer science? Is that, you know, you're just be sat there in a dark and green marketing code on your own, which you can happen if you want it to.

But I think it's more common, the other way around where you're working with people and especially in your role where you've got lots of different clients rather than just one client or one. One manager, you've got that variety, I guess of working with different organisations. Mmm, absolutely. And the the coding aspects and I think this is the case of a lot of jobs.

The coding aspect of the easy bit of it. And you you it might not feel like, you know, as you go into university and you're learning to code, but eventually you get experience with it. And it's very easy thing to to pick up a different language or to transfer a lot of the skills you've already got.

But what's usually a lot harder is is interacting with with clients with customers with if you're within a company's supposed to working with clients, just interacting with the wider, the wider business. Yeah the challenges that that we so often face are with people, not with computers. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, just kind of those social skills.

Like I said, a really important. I mean, don't really put much emphasis on the social stuff in computer science degree, but it is obviously important like you say, and right? So you've been there for two years now and you're based my channel. I think Infinity works actually host. There's a group called, does it hard data, Manchester, they host, Meetups in.

You're in the centre you in circle square? Or yes, we are in circle square. Yeah, they recently hosted or at least sponsored, I'm not exactly sure. But there were definitely part of that her plus data, and there's also a bunch of other meetups that they that they do. I know things have sort of over the past couple years with COVID, things and change a little bit with what's running and what's not.

Yeah, one of, I know one of the, the big events that I turn up to quite a lot, especially, as a student was, was the DevOps battle royale. I developed water in the DevOps battle. Real Battle Royale. Yes, so challenge I guess. Or so it was comparing a bunch of different technologies and right um because there's wide variety of experience that the different consultants have.

If any works, it's quite easy to to sort of go. Hey, does anyone know, AWS, does anyone know Azure how about Google Cloud Platform and go? Okay, if we compare and contrast these different technologies, I mean, how do they all stack up to each other? What can they do?

Well, what do they not? And that's ultimately what. I'm a lot of people in industry are quite interested in because if they're looking at, you know, picking up one of these technologies cloud providers, that sort of thing. They don't have the, the luxury of, you know, loads and loads of time to really thoroughly dig into all of them.

And that's why things like the DevOps, barreal really help because you see a bunch of these technologies from people that have used them for for quite a while and have so much experience and then go. It's great forum for this particular thing. But also um if you've got another set of needs maybe this channel.

Yes here. Yeah, yeah, good. Okay, good. All right. So that's infinity work. So the next bit the next bit, this is called minority port. So I asked students, if you're a member of a minority group because are there any minority groups that you're a member of and that you're happy to discuss and mentioned one earlier?

Yes. Um, yeah. So it's it's a weird one for me. So I've I've got Crohn's. I've had Crohn since I was as I was 10 at university. I think you know, because university is a, a relatively stressful thing, you know, because it's a lot of work at the end of the day.

My Crohn's was especially difficult around then and I guess exam time or any stressful? Period is gonna make things difficult. Yeah and it's the same thing with like a lot of chronic illnesses stress makes everything worse. Yeah. Even I mean if even if you're fully healthy stress is bad stress makes things worse.

So if you're not 100% healthy which I'm not, yeah, exhausted exacerbates symptoms and things like Crohn's. And I'm sure, you know, they'll be students that are in similar situations that have got, chronic illnesses and yes, stress is stress is rough. Um, this came to to a head after university, I had a flare up with my with my Crohn's.

Which long story short, I ended up in the hospital and now I've got an ostomy bag which I, hopefully something that will be sort of reversed soonish. I mean, I know the NHS said struggling at the moment with yeah, getting gum getting through to seeing people. So, I mean, is there anything that you?

Well, so, two two parts, this time is, is what could universities do to make? You could have done them and I guess we would have done some things to make your life easier. But then also, what can employers to do to make workplaces more welcoming to members of, well, anyone with a chronic disease, I'm in the mighty.

I think you could probably include mental health in that little bit as well. Anyone suffering from, you know, anxiety or depression. What what can employers and universities do to make workplaces and campuses more welcoming to people with these sorts of issues? Yeah, So the one, the one place that I can deal with my Crohn's the best because I've got everything that I've got, everything set up is at home, right, right.

If if I've got a problem with, with my Crohns, with my ostomy bag that sort of thing, that's where I want to be. And this is one of the big, The big changes that have happened since COVID is working from home, is now so much more of a thing.

So if I have a problem I can deal with it like people at work won't even realise that I've got an awesome way back. I mean I'm open to talking about and that's also if you're comfortable like very important because companies have to go through like reasonable, you know any reasonable measures to make sure that you can work and everything's?

Okay. Yeah. So if you're comfortable talking about those things with with the company should absolutely do so. But as far as what companies should do, it's let people work from home in the same. Something goes university. Let people study a lot more from home. And that's, there's not been a choice really with with covid.

Is it? It now sort of has to all work from home. It's supercharged that kind of that pattern, hasn't it. Yeah, and good. Okay, so what else we got here and to finish up, then we've got one, two, one podcast and one film. So, just add a little personal touch to it.

So, and can you tell us about one tune? That's important. You will add it to our coders playlist. It might be something that helps you relax or maybe something that you got you through your study or helps you switch off at anything like that. Um, for tune, I'm gonna go for for misery business by Paramore and so my my music tastes haven't changed much since like the middle of high school, I've no problem, no problem admitting that and it songs songs like that sort of meant a lot as as everyone, you know, is going through quite difficult times.

And as, as will be no, surprise to, to most people that are getting involved in computer science, you know, like I was I was bullied at school that happens, you know and I think university students probably more than most will will have experienced that as well. And so it was it was music music like that that really helped me sort of get through get through high school and stuff like still listen to now because I enjoy it.

Yeah, good. Okay. We'll have that. Add that to playlist. How do you spell paramour? Is that p? A, Is it as, in French power PARA and I'll google it anyway. Yes. It's not to know what to Google for. And so, that's one tune. Then the other thing is, you may or may not listen to podcasts.

So if you do listen to a podcast is they're one that you recommend our listeners or if not a podcast, then an audiobook, we'll do. Um, so not a huge podcast person but I I have listened and quite a bit too warm to syntax FM, right? So that's there's a couple of guys, Wes boss and Scott Tolinsky day.

They they talk mainly about like a sort of front-end development and their sort of preferred technologies answering people's questions. That's what I think it's all interesting stuff to hear about and you can get, you know, some inspiration, you know oh I'm gonna play about with them with spell because I've heard it on this this podcast or whenever other technology pops up and so I think that's that's a really good one together.

Okay syntax FM. Yeah and then the last thing is one film so it might be something old or something that's out. Now someone film that you recommend listeners, go and watch. I'm gonna go for Ready Player. One watching it. Watching it in the, in the cinema was was brilliant.

And is For me, seeing a lot of this, this may hurt for some people, but for me, a lot of, like the history and of, a sort of pop culture and technology is I found, I found really interesting and if, if that's sort of the thing that I'm 35 fascinating as well, ready player one, brilliant.

And even if it's not something in particular, you're interested in. It's just, it's just a lot of fun. Um, yeah, really player one, and then, right? So that's the one, two month podcast. One film is, the last bit. This is a looking back. Now is to say and I mean I it sounds like you, you graduated during the pandemic, didn't you see?

We're doing 2020. So you kind of caught by the tail end of that a little bit but if you were, if you could go back the first year and what would you tell your former self in order to to you know, get the most out of their time at university, either?

I do yourself or perhaps fellow students. I mean I think you did a pretty good job while you were here and you made the most of lots of opportunities going and getting you know, placements internships. But what would you what would you tell your former self now that you're older and wise?

Interesting. So, So with with the sort of stress, and an effort that like university takes, I think it's it's really important to be to be looking after your, your mental health. And that goes for, for looking for, for units, to take for, making sure that your, your workload is balanced.

And I think at the University of Manchester you a great job in sort of saying these units, in particular are going to be very, very difficult, very challenging, you're gonna want to try and balance them out, so you definitely shouldn't feel bad going. I've heard from students, maybe that this unit in particular, is a little bit easier.

This is gonna help help make things sane for me at the university. So, I mean, first year I did a computer science in math and end up dropping the mats because right? Okay, I I love it. No. But I think it's described to me at the time. I absolutely agree.

It's 60%. Computer science. 60% to max 60% maths and it's a lot of work. And yeah, making sure that what you've got on, your plate is something you can handle and you know, sort of at the end of the day, something you're enjoying is really important. Yeah, yeah. And that's that, you know, looking looking back now.

Sort of I think, I mean, I see a lot of she's working really hard, but she's good. Yes. But I think it's sometimes can be a little bit unhealthy. When, you know, I've done it myself as well. You just work too hard, you just burn out and then things go wrong.

And it, it's, it's counterproductive in the longer term. Anyway. Yeah, at the end of the day you can make opportunities. You will find opportunities, that can happen. Even if you struggle university or it's not quite working. But there isn't another you. And that's, I really important thing to get, and that's, you really need to do whatever.

It takes, whatever you can to look after yourself, physically and mentally. It's so important. Yeah, good. Okay good, thanks. Well, thanks for joining us. Jonathan, I'll and thanks for coming and sharing your story. Today is good to hear about how you got to where you are now and look forward to hearing about what you get up to in the future.

Yeah, thank you. Thank you so much for having me.
