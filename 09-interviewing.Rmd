# Speaking your future {#interviewing}

Congratulations, you've been invited to an interview. It might be a telephone, video or face-to-face, or it might even be as part of an assessment centre where you'll be asked to complete several other tasks and tests. Being invited to an interview means that the reading and writing of your CV, along with any accompanying covering letters, application forms or digital portfolios, have hit the target. BULLSEYE! ðŸŽ¯

```
(ref:captionbugfree) If you have got an interview, then you have proved that your CV is bug free. That doesn't mean your CV is perfect, it just means that it is good enough to get you an interview with that particular employer. Congratulations! What comes next?

Having passed the first stage, you move onto speaking and listening which you'll do in a live interview. If you've got an interview, you can feel good about having a bug-free CV shown in Figure \@ref(fig:bugfree-fig). But now you have a new set of problems. How can you prepare for the interview? What kinds of interviews exist and what questions might you be asked? If they offer you a job, how will you negotiate the terms, conditions and salary? Do you *really* want the job anyway and are they the kind of people you actually want to work with everyday? You'll be giving this employer:

* most of the hours of your day
* most of the days of your week
* most of the weeks of your year
* something like the next two years of your life [@jonathanblack] as the first part of you 80,000 hours

So you want to ensure employers are a good match and not going to waste your time.


## What you will learn {#ilo9}

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

* Identify kinds of interviews you might be invited to
* Anticipate common interview questions, technical and non-technical
* Prepare questions for your interviewer
* Formulate strategies for negotiating job offers
* Calm your interview nerves

## Interviews
<!-- Add BOB YOU"RE ON MUTE!!! -->

Broadly speaking there are two basic kinds of interviews

* technical or [coding interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_interview)
* non-technical interview, sometimes called competency based interview or HR interview (human resources)

### Competency interviews {#hrinterview}

Competency interviews are there to test your soft skills, find out what you're like, how you work in a team, if you can communicate well. For more information on non-technical interviews see:

* [google.com/search?q=competency+based+interview+questions](https://www.google.com/search?q=competency+based+interview+questions)


1. What roles can you play in a team?
1. Tell me about a time when you showed integrity and professionalism
1. Can you give an example of a situation where you solved a problem in a creative way?
1. Tell me about a big decision you've made recently. How did you go about it?
1. Give an example of a time you handled conflict in the workplace
1. How do you maintain good working relationships with your colleagues?
1. Describe a project where you had to use different leadership styles to reach your goal
1. Give me an example of a challenge you faced and tell me how you overcame it
1. How do you influence people in a situation with conflicting agendas?
1. Tell me about a time that you made a decision and then changed your mind.
1. Tell me about a time when you achieved success even when the odds were stacked against you.

Since there's already tonnes of information The rest of this chapter will focus on technical interviews, also known as coding interviews.

### Coding interviews {#codinginterview}


<!-- I Cheated on My Microsoft Interview you can cheat [@cheating]


1. Using a whiteboard (or even google docs), you're unlikely to have access to a compiler or an IDE
1. Pattern matching (what interview questions are similar to this)
1. Simplify and generalise (tweak constraints, then does that approach )
1. Clarify the question, state your assumptions
1. Base case and build () start from n = 1, then build to n = 2 etc [@polya]
1. Show your working, talk out loud, mention trade-offs of your approach^[gayle video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0B4mOtwX0]


Solving different coding challenges can help you become a better problem solver, master a given programming language, prepare for job interviews and learn new algorithms. It will help you become a better engineer and can provide good evidence for the experience section of your CV.-->


There are a lots of resources to help you prepare for and practice coding interview questions, the best place to start is *Cracking the Coding Interview* by Gayle Laakmaan McDowell. [@cracking] As well as reading Gayle's book, there are lots of online resources to help you prepare for coding interviews. Before we look at those, University of Manchester Computer Science graduate Petia Davidova explains in figure \@ref(fig:petia-fig) what she learned from failing several coding interviews at big technology companies. ðŸ˜­

(ref:captionpetia) My worst software engineering interview fails, failing my Facebook and Google Interviews by Petia Davidova. Petia demonstrates her [growth mindset](#growthmindset) and productive failure. Although she failed her interviews, she learned lots from the process and went on to get a job she wanted.

Coding interviews can be tough, but preparing for them, and doing them will make you a better engineer. So if you spectacularly wipeout in your coding interview, reflect and think how can you improve next time? Perhaps you need to

* Read up on some more data structures
* Familiarise yourself with more algorithms
* Practice thinking out loud (verbally) by doing a mock technical interview?

All of these things will help both your general professional development and your chances of success in future technical interviews.

### Project Euler {#euler}

### ICPC

More than 50,000 students worldwide from more than 3,000 universities in 111 countries participate in over 400 on-site competitions as part of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) see [icpc.global](https://icpc.global/). In it's own words the ICPC is:

> an algorithmic programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems,
> fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each
> other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. [@icpc]

ICPC is organised by the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery) (ACM), a global organisation which advances computing as a science and a profession.

There are subregional contests for ICPC, so in the UK there is the United Kingdom and Ireland Programming Competition (UKIEPC) which is part of the Northwestern Europe European Regional Contest (NWERC).

UKIEPC has been held annually since 2013 to help universities pick teams to travel to NWERC. Ask your University if they are involved, see [ukiepc.info](http://ukiepc.info). If they aren't involved yet, you should consider encouraging them to join. It's not about winning, it's about taking part.

<!-- interviews can be counter-productively stressful

<!--### changing your mind

You may decide to change your mind about an offer you've already accepted. You need to

* Are you sure? Think it through carefully, discuss your options with friends and family.
* Read your contract of employment again: there may be clauses in your contract describing the consequences of changing your mind - make sure you understand these
* Tell the employer quickly: explain why you've changed your mind (personal circumstances, you have a better offer etc) the sooner the better
* Learn from this mistake: it's not good to accept offers you're not serious about so try to learn from this mistake so you don't repeat it in the future

## Summarising interviews {#tldr9}

[Too long, didn't read](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read) (TL;DR)? Here's a summary:

This chapter is incomplete but...

We've looked at a range of platforms and competitions that can help you prepare for coding interviews. These won't just make you better at coding interviews, they'll make you a better engineer too, whatever stage you're at.
