# Scheduling your future {#scheduling}  
This is the schedule for the live (synchronous) sessions for Coding Your Future in 2021 (COMP2CARS), on **Mondays at 1pm on Zoom** where they complement the second year tutorials (COMP2TUT) at the University of Manchester.

As with semester 1, COMP2CARS takes place in the same slot as COMP2TUT when you meet your personal tutor. See the timetable [studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/timetable](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/timetable/).

These sessions will revisit themes from semester one if you missed them last semester, we'll also have an open session where we'll tackle whatever issues you need about finding placements and internships during 2021. We'll be meeting at [zoom.us/my/duncanhull](http://zoom.us/my/duncanhull), please sign into zoom with your \@student.manchester.ac.uk account.
