# Raw machine-generated podcast transcript, contains errors

So Welcome. Thank you, uh, for coming on the show.

Um, could you start by saying a little bit about if you want what your name is and how you got to hear today? I'm manahu. I'm from Pakistan originally. And I came here, I think around three years ago in Manchester Um, and um, Can you remember your first exposure to Computing?

Is there something you said in your memory? You can but I feel like the first exposure wasn't as interesting as I. How I got to be more interested in it. So first exposure was obviously jcsc's I took Computing. I remember at the time, Is in my school. We were just learning how to make PowerPoint presentations on a computer.

That was it? And then that's quite common. Unfortunately. Oh, okay. I didn't know that and then gcses were coming up and we had all these options and because it's an external board. So we could choose, I remember having a conversation with my principal and he was like, yeah, if you want to get a good grade you can but that's about it.

It. I was pretty good at it because I was I had a mathematical mind. I think most people who end up in Computing are like that, they're usually good at computer science and math. Um but at that time I wanted to be a lawyer because of family influence. I guess they've wanted me to be a lawyer as well and it seemed like the easiest career path for a girl.

Because it's like sometimes you can even do it in less than three years, and there's lots of qualities that help with it. And then I when I got into a levels so the Computing as a level as well. Yeah, following on from GCC, yeah, I was good at it and I wanted good grades.

My I did take English, the teacher was probably quite good as well. Should we should we name check? The teacher, was the teacher good? Or was it, was it the subject that you really engaged with more than the teacher, a little bit of both? I think a bit of bold but I feel like the teacher was like, more helping us to get a good grade, right?

Um, When I felt like Computing was something I didn't study for and still got a good grade. So yeah right and then I feel like my 11th teacher had my degree influence. So at that time when I entered Ayla was I took English language. Um, because I wanted to do law.

And then I also got into things like debating and things like that, everything I hated, but I was just building a career path for myself and then I took part in this competition, it was an essay competition. And the topic was interestingly. Can legal decisions be passed on to algorithms, right?

So that when I started writing a legal essay, that's where I found out that I was actually more interested in the algorithm side of it and then I started to discover Ai and really got interested in like Mimicking human intelligence, right? Um and like into Ai and I was I think my first exposure to some large language models as well.

And how different kinds of research was going around in the world. I did win the essay competition on the basis of my legal knowledge. On my, it was an international like I think it was bringing UK only. It was a more sassy competition and then the next year, I decided to become chair of the Technology Society which was um High School.

Yeah we do. We do up till gcses. We are in like a different school and then for a levels we move to like college Barely have societies, and I decided to share the technology society and then because I I felt like I was so away from Computing and I was in the sheltered world where I didn't even know, like, how much stuff is going on around the world.

And I didn't want others to be like that especially because it was something so much fun and something I got. So passionate about in very little time, Google how to play in it because I was at home with my laptop. Had a lot of time to research and be in my own world, so you're doing in your a levels during covid.

First year was yes, in Corbett, second year was hybrid at first and then more in person, right? So then, yeah, I connected with people from big Tech companies because by that time I'd made up my mind that I want to work in big Tech. So I contacted some people over LinkedIn from Microsoft and Google and Honeywell some, my dad helped as well.

He had some old friends from college and then I held webinars with them and then I also quickly started to get good at programming and I held programming workshops, right? So by that, it was pretty clear that I would do a degree in Computing. Like, well, that's an interesting story.

I think it's kind of interesting when people have changed their mind. Right? Because you go out on one path and then actually you actually Fork off on another one. Yeah. It has a lot to do with the exposure that you have in your earlier years. Yeah, definitely. A parental influence in teachers and how you grow up.

Also, what you're exposed to. I'm I guess.

And so much of coding. Stuck indoors all day. Yeah. Okay good. So um, You then decide. So then by the time you finish, right? I always decide what I want to do at University. You come to University, you've finished your first year. So I mean that must have been a big change coming to a new country.

Adapting to studying here in the UK. It was a huge change for me. So initially the plan was that my parents would come and drop me here. As we had done like my entire life, uh, by then there were their videos. I was delayed and mine came before them, and Manchester was also like a last resort for me, right?

Kind of, because I wanted to go, I wanted to go to the states. Okay. I didn't get into any ivy leaks. Yeah, that was my initial plan because I was meeting these people who were at like, yeah. So that, that's where I wanted to go Silicon Valley. Yeah, and my dad was like, you know, just for backup because he was seeing that I was applying to the Stockton.

Um,

Know, consider five, you guys options in the UK and just one day before the deadline I wrote my essay for Manchester, but I had really good grades. So I would have gotten it, right? So obviously, my Visa and plans for the UK were very much delayed. I had also paid like a fee, uh, to keep my admission mistakes.

But then, I ended up here, I guess it's where I was meant to be. You have to pay to apply to, uh, well, you pay to apply that was actually waived for me because I was applying to a lot of places, um, and my counsellor was like, very, very proud of um, how far I'd come, but then once you get your place, you have to pay to hold your place.

All right. Like you have a time period, right? So I have paid to another University. Um, so when they make you an offer, you will you have to, as well as sort of in order to hold off, you have to pay to accept it. So I guess to stop people.

Level of commitment. They do refund part of it later on, right? So, yeah, I was a bit late to Manchester, but I was the kind of person who wouldn't even go to school without my mum, like, up to a levels, my mum would drop me, um, and a lot of my friends were like, you need to grow up.

Like the corner shop without my mum, right? And here I was sitting on a plane and I was like, what have I done? Right. Um so yeah it was exciting, I guess daunting but exciting at the same time. Yeah as far as it was daunting and very difficult to settle in I guess I just distracted myself by being in Kilburn all the time right?

Um and it was really lonely at the night because It's a very, very noisy City. You can hear cars all night and yeah, Karachi. Yeah, yeah, massive City. Yeah. And we always forget about the main road. Yeah, so this car is like all night and I was in my dorm room and I could hear myself breathe, and I was like, what's happening?

And then there was thankfully, these extractor funds. So I could write that noise, right? Good. So you've done your, you've done your first year and I guess there's probably a lot of stories. You can tell about settling in Um but I suppose the next the next thing I'd be interested to hear from you about is you've got the end of your first year.

I think had you finished your first year of study? I think, did you just think about doing a summer internship at the end of the first year or were you? Yeah. Um, and first year, it's fortunate that we have these spa sessions. Uh, so my past leader was Sam right.

Uh, right. Okay. Even because he had he was like sharing. I think five societies at the time, right? And he was also applying for internships and that's what he was doing all the time and he really guided us and when he looked at my CV, I think he was the first person who looked at that, ugly piece of tables.

My CV was literally in tables looking eye. That's quite common though. I think like often people have got really good content, but they they because I mean when you when you do your ucas application you just fill in a form. So you don't have to worry too much about that.

Whereas when you do a CV it's like you can do any, it's like freeform. You can do it any way. You like they call that the CD like high schools. They print that out and they make you feel it. And that's visually your eyes for CV. And that's what I had.

But then I joined unecs as well, and I saw everybody around me was applying for somewhere internships and I was like, okay, this is something I need to do as well. Right, good. So, did you find something the end of your first year? Uh, no. I was because of the condition of my CV.

I was getting rejected. I had like, um, I was good at interviews, but it was just at my scene TVs in the first place, right? Yeah. It was a set. I never got the interviews, uh, some of them, the video ones I did, but my CV was in a horrible shape and I wasn't good at coding interviews.

Like, even if I made, uh, the video,

Things. But I didn't do that because people were getting summer internships and I wanted someone internship as well. So I ended up with I.T services at the end because I didn't want nothing. I wanted like some work experience, maybe transferable as well. So I was here in Kilburn all summer.

Right learning about kind of devopsy type stuff, I guess, was it? Oh yeah, and it was project to replace the computers across campus, right? At 4, 000 of them. And then also, like, deploy software, okay? There was a bit of admission, um, deploying stuff and a bit of Linux stuff as well.

I learnt how to like install Linux and I saw the insights of the system we have and the configuration of the new screens, right? But a lot of it with Hardware as well.

You not the computer that 4 000. People have in front of them. Yeah, I remember like when we opened up a CPU, um, I my like manager. He was asking me like, we we don't know the bios password. Do you know what to do? And I'm looking up at encryption and hacking and online things, and things like you just plug out the jumper wire.

And I'm like, what's that? So it was different. Look, I mean, get good to get some experience in fish because I think it's quite hard. In first year to get experience unless you go perhaps down the Insight route. That's maybe a little bit easier but they also became foundational to getting away through like better, placements later.

And then in first year you're competing with people in second and third year as well. So you're kind of like, you know, Way someone who's got more experience than you, which is tough. Um, so that was the end of Yeah, first year you started second year, you were you thinking about doing another internship the following time?

Do you start applying then? So you used all that experience of applying in first year then to apply for stuff in the second year, which was, I think did you apply for placements or internships or a bit like Here, I knew that I didn't want to do placements because I wanted to graduate in three years and also I feel like three summer internships kind of equate.

Uh two places a year, both financially and time wise. Yeah. Wanted to go by the summer internships where I could also do different companies and different projects, like smaller commitment as well. So again, I was applying for a summer internships. Um, I A bit late. I I think I did like 20 applications or so the difference in first year and second year me was I had learnt a lot.

Yeah, so now I knew that I have to put full quality in every applications. I I know some people find that doing more is more helpful, but I felt like I need to put my full effort in a few and like fully prepare for all of those interviews yesterday, wasn't it balancing the quality and the quantity?

The temptation is to go for quantity because it's be able to say that. In first year it didn't work for me. So I was like I can't do that again. But then I think if you, if you if you go for Quality you tend to, you know, there's a

Get an interview, but when you target these companies, it's also important to know your chances like Not just like seeing every adword and going for it. But seeing like the level of match there is because when I saw like some of these AdWords, for example, AWS, I would literally sit with my CV and the adword and I would check off things.

I've got this. I've got this, they should take me and here are a few extras. And for the ones where I felt that I wouldn't get in. Like, for example, some software engineering roles I felt like I didn't have a lot of experience at the end of first year so I didn't apply for those.

Um it would have been wasted application or not, I don't know. In, before we talk about the internship, can you talk about? What were the main obstacle? I mean you talk about some of them already I guess a little bit. But were there any other obstacles? You've faced along the way in finding that.

Internship at the end of second year because I get I think I think a big problem for a lot of second years is balancing doing work. Yes, having a life. I'm doing job applications. Yes, I feel like in second year, I was really over committed to a lot of things given that I was doing student partnership.

I was the chair of unacs. Also took some really difficult courses and there was a deadline every other week, so it was really difficult. So I feel like my strategy of doing quality over quantity was also like more helpful here. Because I and then I took those periods, like reading week, um, and then weekends, uh, to like take out some time and sit and work on my applications.

It was also the time where I made a portfolio, but it's just important to make sure that you schedule time and take out time to do things like this. I'll be honest by Christmas. I thought I'm gonna end up like first year again, without an internship. But it turns out that some of the companies that you applied to during that November December period, To get back to you by like January, and that's when they have most of the because they're waiting for those last applications to come in and they get back to you by January, when to hear nothing other than maybe an autoresponder.

Nothing at all. Sometimes you don't even get that. Thank you for your application. I remember it was least expected. I just submitted the application online and three months later, I received like an email saying, there's an interview. I was like, did I even apply for this? Because I couldn't even find it in my inbox.

There wasn't even a confirmation, but when I logged in my application, was there, right portal. About obstacles. I feel like some of them had um, I like wanted you to have experience which is weird because a lot of people have it as a first internship. Yeah. So that's a big obstacle.

I feel like companies should reconsider. Um expecting like loads of experience and like looking for potential instead because a lot of people have like great potential but they just need their first and definitely first chance. So for summer internships and second year, I feel like that's the biggest obstacle.

Yeah. So you've got your, you've got the job with AWS. For the summer of the end of your second year. This is last summer, isn't it? Yes. It seems like ages ago. Yeah. So in January I heard back from them that was after like an online test and submitting my CV.

It was a coding interview, was it? Um, technical or was it just non-technical? It was just like some scenarios and I had to write answers and then memory game of some sword. I, I don't remember it so many but it was something like it wasn't coding. Uh and so in January, I heard back after all these things that I'd done back in November Um, and during my exams, I had my interviews.

Uh, and there was a lot of coursework as well, but some people were like focused on this. And then I did there were two rounds of interviews. The first one was more behavioural where I was asked like scenario-based questions, leadership principles coming and those is it nine Amazon principles?

They're quite hot on. Those is it twice 12 and they will actually, they don't just say them, they actually do them as well. And ask you about them in an interview and even in promotions as well. I think they use them for. Yeah, you have like, uh, every time we review performance, we have to like, say which principles have reacted on the most, um, and that's how they measure progress as well.

And those are good principles. I mean, and they apply not just to Amazon, right? I mean, yeah. That's pretty Sand principles wherever you end up working, right? Yes. I can't think of any examples, but

Working backwards with, um, like customer Obsession. Yeah, these are principles, you could basically apply everywhere. So, I feel like getting through that, first interview is just knowing the principles by heart, speaking them in every answer and making sure that you justify all your choices by the principles, right? Um, and then the second one was a bit more technical.

Um, there was an ml engineer, I think who interviewed me. Um, it wasn't the traditional encoding interview where you go through a question. He basically opened my portfolio, Of his choice, I wasn't expecting it first. He like asked me to walk through my portfolio. That was a link on my CV that I never expect anyone to open but still I do, I do.

Um, so yeah, he opened that first. I walked through it and then he's randomly picked one and then he asked me to walk through the entire deck stack of the project, right? Um, and even the libraries that I had used right, One. And we also went into the like the specifics of the code.

So I guess one advice for that kind of interview is to know your projects and not put something on your CV if you don't know it. Well yeah was that an ml project as it happened or was it not an ml project? No, it was by fan automation, right?

It was basically a project I made to automate things on WhatsApp because I was dealing with a lot of WhatsApp because of my like, extracurriculars, While covet was happening there was also something that I had something around on your phone or something. I ran, I used it on my laptop, right?

I don't know if it didn't run on your phone or not. Uh, probably, uh, I also use that to like, WhatsApp application that you run on your desktop. Yes, that's then Tethered to your phone effectively. So you've got WhatsApp on your desktop. That way, most people use it on their phone, don't they?

But actually So it's a lot easier to use your desktops. I feel like from my application I work on Have to have the desktop open because I ran it on command and I didn't have like your connections. Yeah, yeah. So we just went through that, right? That was good.

Um, so, um, Can you say a little bit about what your roles and responsibilities were at AWS last summer? What you're doing? The stuff that you can talk about, obviously? So I was part of the Mainframe modernisation team, which is in London. Uh yes, I was working in the London office.

Mainframe modernisation team. Now, this is not something I chose because I don't even know and I didn't know what it meant. Now, I know you just get deployed, right? You you get accepted and then they deploy you into whatever team they see fit. Yeah. And then you just, but my manager did tell me that he usually like got to interview people and talked to them like about their interests and like put them in a team, but that didn't happen with me.

I don't know what happened there. The states, like my entire team, as I told you, when I met you after my internship. My entire team was in the states. Me and another intern. We were just the ones in London office, right? And the other intern. She was an MBA intern.

And she was like, I think more than okay, I shouldn't say that, but, um, she had eight years of experience in data science, right? So like we could connect but not in a way that I would have would like local teams. How, like, on the other floor, there were 35 interns with local team.

So I was a bit jealous but then like I settled in. So, in the Mainframe modernisation team, we basically Companies, but Legacy workloads on the Mainframe and then modernising them to AWS, right? This is client clients rather than it's, not an internal thing, it's clients. Yes, so my work was more internal like I would sit in, um, and observe customer engagements and customer meetings, right?

But not directly, um, engage with them. Like I was in there in the meetings. My job was to Internal process. So basically was a new and growing area. Um, I was in the worldwide team that basically led the strategy for the rest of the teams and the other regions, right?

So I made this enablement platform. Where I observe like the process from end to end where a customer comes. And then we look at their workloads. Um and then like build a pipeline of how we're going to bring them over to AWS, but then. There was a bit of like a gap because it's a highly technical field.

So there was a bit of a gap between the account teams that the customers come to and then the deployment teams. So I was working on like making a platform where we could bring everything together and enable more like engagement with customers and like a foster pipeline so that's interesting.

Sounds quite hard as well. That's quite challenging. So we get a lot of training. That's the thing like whenever I tell someone which team I was in We get a lot of training, there was a three months onboarding plan, which is basically the time I was there. And the courses are like 10 hours long?

Is that AWS University? Do they call it? Or is that something different? Like whatever thing called? Like these kind of onboarding programs, you do it in your spare time or you do it. Had a certain amount of time every week where you're doing something like, right? I mean, sometimes when I felt like I was behind on my project, I would do it at home and some of them were a bit extra as well.

Um, They just wanted to have a whole comprehensive picture and then there was this ml University that we attended in the other London office for two days. Uh, even though our work was not directly related to it but they offer like a lot of training. And even the platforms that I use like lots of internal AWS tools because you use all their tools, they offer like a lot of training and then once a week there's a meeting with your manager who guides you to more resources so that you can feel like you're a part of a team and not, you know, not somewhere you don't belong and then twice a week.

There's a meeting with a mentor. States. But they did make sure that our time zones, clashed at some point. And then there's a subject area Champion as well. So, like, as you're drafting resources, you're obviously not the expert there so you can get everything reviewed by them, right? So there's like a lot of resources to help.

So, I guess kind of the main. So, two two questions. There are main things that you learnt and then the other one is What did you most enjoy about? Last summer. I feel like one of the main skills that I got, um, it might be a bit ironic but it was about scheduling, um, because a lot of my time I think one hour, at least per day was spent scheduling meetings around because I was meeting with people from different parts of the world sometimes.

Japan sometimes Australia, my team was in the states. Uh, some of the people were in France, so keeping up with their, uh, time zones. Sometimes I would end up waking up at 6am or like sleeping at 11 PM, but the timing's were flexible. I could then sleep in, in the afternoon, right?

So one great skill that I got was learning the classic Outlook getting everybody standard uh schedules in like one place and making sure my schedule is visible to everyone. I feel like in University, we just mind our own business with our own schedules. Even with the roles I had, you have your schedule a lot of your social editors have been posed on you but you're given a timetable, right?

Yeah. And you're given deadlines and okay, you can decide but you're kind of

I had to do office hours over two weeks which meant like bringing all these people from all over the world into one like virtual room right which was near impossible. Um because because of timing. Yeah. So then I like ended up doing two sessions but knowledge of time zones and the states has more than one time zone.

Of course, is it? How many is it? Five six. Yeah, I don't know many but then there's a significant difference between the East Coast and West Coast and yeah because like A sensible time in the U.S and one's really not a sensible time if you're talking people in California.

Yeah. So knowing that, they're from the states is not enough. You have to know where in the states. So yeah, that's one big skill, which is very important and it's transferable to a lot. Yeah. And then another one was obviously AWS and Cloud skills, right? We don't learn them at University, at least.

And first year, Do any of the, um, AWS certifications along the way. Did you get any of those? Yeah, a lot of them. I think I did the cloud ones and all the Mainframe ones and Mainframe wider, Innovation ones. And some of the complex, three ones as well. I learnt some more ml as well which reinforce like the knowledge already taught at University.

And then learning about Mainframe modernisation itself and learning a lot of, like, industry practises as well, like how to talk to and how to present proposals, how to talk to people at senior levels and responsibility. For example, like, if you're presenting something to a director that has to be like, in a specific format, Time is important and also the importance of following brand guidelines.

It was something I realised much later. I built my entire Like application um or platform. And then everybody was really happy with it. My manager loved it, my mentor loved it. And they felt like I was really good at like graphic designing and like the visual aspects of it and then I met the director and he he's like it doesn't look like it's from Amazon.

Um, because and then I found out that I had to use like right, um, the brand guidelines and I only had two weeks then, but I did manage to do it in a week and like, take it back to him. So,

Ux which reinforced this, but I hadn't done it. So when they did this year. Yes. So what she said, made more sense, then because Simon taught us that It's not your job as a developer or like as somebody who's not a ux designer. That you're not supposed to like come up with your own colours and your own designs no matter how pretty they are.

You have to follow like the Prime guidelines and you have to let the team responsible for doing it, do it. Omega. It's good to understand it right. But yes it yeah. Because you can't do everything. Can you can't do all these different things, right? So um, I said like obviously done heaps there by sounds of things, so anything that was particularly enjoyable or rewarding about that and I guess it must be nice seeing.

I think about meeting a lot of people and having level of impact that I did. Because there you measure everything by the impact that you have like, everybody loves numbers. Like at the end of it, my the subject matter expert, we call them the content Champions even they were really happy with it and my system was able to like bring together.

Um, people who were not as easily connected from different parts of the world, so like they were really happy with it and I also built some really good connections. Um, they're not in the same country but um, they do keep in touch and like uh and you never know when they might be useful, you know?

Or, you know, they might, they might move country and suddenly they'll be working in the same country as you in the future. Yeah. I feel like one of them came here like to visit the UK office, there was a conference happening, so I met them but really, I feel like the exposure that you get and the number of people that you meet and the real responsibility on you, for the first time.

Um, yeah, that was really gratifying.

Someone comes from an end, you start your final year in September of last year. Um, can you tell us a little bit about what you did for your final year project which you just finished? Recently finished. Yep so for my final year project I worked on knowledge wraps. So I didn't it's a Knowledge graph for people who I mean I guess most computer scientists know what Knowledge Graphics.

But why before getting like exposure to the project, uh so knowledge, Graph is basically a type of database, a graph database, um, or like you can see an anthology where you can connect nodes with relationships, um, to other nodes.

And for files, or it can also be like to just represent text with, like connections and relationships. Um, so for example, you could summarise something as a knowledge graph or like instead of a relational database, you could mine was more the second one. So you guys Is. Computer science student, for example, very simple knowledge.

Yes, for, for my case, it was paperwork was a node and an author was a note when you was a node. So paper was written in, um, here. And then that's a note and written in is a relationship and written by his relationship. And an author is the node.

Like I got introduced to this was I was before AWS. I was going to do a summer internship with Risa. She was working on. Um was she the supervisor of your project? No she was on sabbatical. Right? Okay, it's complicated. I reached out to her initially but So I was going to do a summer internship with her that was on Knowledge, graphs and Document retrieval using knowledge wraps.

So she was like working on a document engine, like document search engine search by And then I got AWS and the university was very late and getting back to me. So I had already signed the contract by man. Yeah, so then, when I got back, I reached out to her again and I wrote up a similar proposal to what she had done, because I was really interested in that kind of thing.

Sabbatical leave. So she guided me to some other people that I could get in touch with. And that's how I found my supervisor. He was, um, yeah. Oh yeah. I don't know either. So then initially I wanted to do something more medical. Um, But getting that data is really difficult.

I reached out to like a few places. And they were like because I'm not doing a PhD. And there were certain levels of clearance that you need. Um, I couldn't get that data. So then I was like okay, I'll do academic papers. There's no ethical restrictions on that they're publicly available, and a lot of them.

Millions of them. Yes, that was also a problem because, you know, we have so many restrictions, uh, like resource constraints. I had a lot of data then. Uh but I integrated Knowledge graph. Retrieval with large language models to like combine symbolic, and semantic reasoning. So like knowledge back would support Wallet retrieval.

Which I also I think made some great progress in because Uh usually there's citation graphs that you find online that don't like to take into account venues and years and authors. So things like this paper sites, this paper. And this paper size this paper that kind of stuff, which I found was usually not enough at least according, um, to the work that I did.

Because sometimes the venues where they return or the authors, um, or even the years, um, they when they connect over like thousands of nodes or millions of nodes, they reveal some unexpected connections. So like I did a graph-based reversal of those to explore those connections. Like really dance crafts.

And then like I applied um, some semantic reasoning. Using large language models to make sure the content was actually semantically similar and not just like those relationships that picked that it has the most similar one, right? Yeah. So, yeah, that was basically my project. Well, you've actually, I think you've published it online as well.

It's good to see you when students put their PCS online. So, um, yes. So I applied for this BCS conference, um, as yourself. Um, it's for women. I saw it posted on Monday mail and I think somebody went to it last year as well as I've heard about it last year.

I was it this year I was in Scotland. Uh, yeah, it was in Glasgow this year, so I applied. I feel like in January I wrote up an abstract and I submitted it and oh for your final year project is a thing. Yes, yeah.

What am I doing? Why am I doing it? Yes. Why would anyone care in in the first semester? A lot of my time was spent and that's the way my supervisor preferred it as well, to plan out the project, and write a concrete plan, step by step and know what I'm working on and what are my deliverables and that kind of shapes your abstract, right?

Because in your abstract, you're talking about what the whole project is about, what your goals are, what your evaluation methods are, and it's good to have them figured out before. So that, you know, you you don't lose track and you have your goals in mind. So that's something I worked on in first semester, rather than just starting the development, by the way.

So I was like working on learning what knowledge graphs really are. Because it was kind of easy for me to come up with an abstract. Um and then I think they got back to me in two months. So around that time where we're submitting the code now, I remember the code submission deadline was the same as the post resubmission deadline.

They wanted us to like submit a poster but I was really happy to know. I was shortlisted because it was really competitive this year. Uh, so then I made my poster and I spoke to my supervisor about it and then submitted that. Good. So you had I think it's nice because you've got a, you've got a trip to Glasgow out a bit, go to a conference, but that's the one I went there.

I felt like I'm doing a disservice to Academia by having my poster there. Because, um, there were like a lot of people, some from Masters as well. And there was so much that I got exposed to so many different projects and research ideas. A lot of them were also like just ideas that had not like concrete projects, backing them yet but they were brilliant ideas.

Questions was so interesting. I was depressed, I think three, four days after it because I felt like, what am I even doing? Um, but yeah, I got over it and I was like, it was a big opportunity to like, have been part of that. It was your network a bit as well.

Yeah, it was really helpful with networking as well because Universities. The summer internship that I got for Liverpool, I think it was a little bit because of that because I met the representatives from the University of Liverpool. And we had this VR and I looked at the campus, um, standing now I was saying, okay, so the ninth place to like, spend some time.

And I also left like my emails and contacts with a lot of people. And there were a lot of communities that I joined for example ROTC. Rewriting. The code. What's RTC are? We writing code, right? Yeah. It's a really good Community. Like, I've seen them here, but I really didn't know much about the help that you can get from them before going there.

So I joined them and I got a premium subscription from meat gold, right? Like they were giving it out to 1 000 people, and that has been really helpful, by the way, for preparing for technical interviews. So,

We've come to the end. So you've you've Um, finished your degree. You've done this gone to this BCS women thing, Um, what comes next? Once you've got graduation, you come into graduation next month. Yeah. And then so what comes next? What do you plan to do? Next um yes I next I feel like I know for the next three months.

What I'm doing. Um I I'm working with the University of Liverpool. There's a virtual engineering centre, so I'm working in the digital Innovation facility for 3 months as a data scientist intern. Um, I really felt like I want my future role to look like a data scientist or a machine learning engineer.

So I feel like that experience would really help me land. Um, a role like that. I've also been coming up with some ideas to start my own business, but I obviously want like some experience and exposure to the industry, um, before I get into doing that. So yeah, it's the Mac, the Manchester on, there's no massoud entrepreneurship Centre doing some events next week.

You might be interested some of them, but I don't, it's not something that I want to do immediately. No, because it feels like a bit daunting before. Like, yeah. Getting your hands dirty on, like some projects and like having more exposure to the industry. I know some people do it, but the failure rate is 80.

I did my research. I think the failure rate 80 whenever you start. That's true. That's true. But yeah. Okay. Um, Some struggles with because I've been talking to lots of students. About Visa issues where I was in a seminar. I don't know, were you in that egrad careers? Seminar earlier this week, there was a there was any grad seminars, but talking a while, so, About, that was either.

You, you need us. If you, if, you know, if you're not gonna buy graduate B, well, you you can either go for a graduate visa. You pay for it yourself, but they expire after two years. So, Able to get the employer to agree. To carry on sponsoring you and some are some are not And then the other route is then sponsorship, where they fully sponsor.

You don't pay anything yourself. And both of those routes have been. Difficult. I think this year and what sort of, what's your experience been of that? Yeah, I think it's really difficult because some of the roles that I apply for it, they just directly email after the pre-filtering that you don't have a Visa.

Even if you do get The Graduate visa route, um a lot of employers these days are looking for permanent right to work stages. Passport or some kind of settlement status. So that because they're looking at like long-term prospects, they want you to continue without Without like having to need a visa for like the rest of your career at least five years.

Uh, some of these companies also have that five years clearance where you need to be in the UK for five years. And then they'll sponsor you, which doesn't kind of work because no degree is five years long, except for actually yeah. Um, so a lot of companies have that as well.

I remember, I reached out to one of these recruiters as well and I was like, um, you say that you do sponsor for some of these roles and then they're like, but you need to have five years. Um, and I was like, okay, first, right? Because it's, it's, it's hard enough him to do all these applications, but you don't really don't want to waste any of your time, applying to jobs where the answer's no just because they don't really say it.

It would have been like a bit more easier if it was set on the page, but you submit your application, you do the psychometric tasks. You spend your two three hours on it and I'm the kind of person who believes in like putting time and quality into an application.

Um and then you hear back saying that you're not eligible um and one of them said that you don't have the basic requirements and I was like wait, do I

Junior students come up to me and they told me that the first second years. Yeah, they were facing trouble with Insight weeks and some were internship as well, which is, thankfully, something that I've never had to face in my batch because they didn't care about Visa because we were working on the student Visa, but now.

Yeah. So we should say, like, while you're a student in the UK, you have the right to do a summer internship or a replacement if you want. Because yeah, it's pretty clear and nobody cared about. Um, like when I got my call from AWS, I was just asked, do you have the right to work in the UK?

They didn't ask me when it expires and those kind of questions because it was just like summer internship.

Weeks. They say that. This is an event for for a minute Visa holders, only or British Nationals. I feel like HSBC and site week was one of them like people couldn't even do the one week thing, and I think even just a year ago. I know, Bar, please, for example, were doing Ago.

They were okay with it and then a year later, it all changed. Yeah, so I feel like at least they should get some more internships. Uh, like students are already like in so much struggle. And um, so not confident about themselves when they're applying for inside weeks and summer internships because it's going to be their first time working in industry and like applying their skills in the real world.

Um, and when that becomes a barrier, as soon as they start applying, it's really becomes like hopeless for them. And at that point, I didn't even know what advice to give to them. So I just asked them to like, look at more companies. Yeah, yeah. I mean there you can find information out so that seminar is talking about.

I went to this week, you can dig in by

To sponsor these visas but even within the sector, there's variability. So yeah, Bank of New York weren't doing it and Bank of America are. So it's kind of like you even within a sector. You can't know I think Amazon I think Amazon's name came up as being somebody who did sponsor visas um yeah they do in the UK.

But my offer was for Spain. So they don't do that there. Like I said, oh, so you have that must be refrigeration so you've done you've impressed them. They like you, they make a return offer. Yeah. But it's not for the UK, it's for Spain, so you can't take it.

Yeah, I was like really happy with my team. My team was really happy with me as well. Um, We were a good fit but like things just technically didn't work out. Um, but also I feel like, um, Applying a bit early. I I got a bit late because I was like, expecting I had an offer and then I didn't.

So sort of withdrawn at the last minute effectively like you had an offer in hand and half worth. I could not think of like a better place to work at than um AWS because I felt like from childhood. I was like I want to be in big tag and this was finally happening and um, it finally a culture fit was also like so difficult.

For example, sometimes you stop working in places where you find that it's not for you. And I was, I took like the pause for applying but yeah, I think I would advise other people not to do that. Always have like a backup option, uh which is something that's really important because things sometimes is technically don't work out.

Even if everybody wants to make them work.

Um, companies like little white. And then JB Morgan. Amazon, Google, all of these sort of companies do sponsor. Yeah. And then your chances are better. Yeah, okay, good. So, um, The next bit is. My so we've your story. We you've taught us a lot about your story about how you got ahead today.

So, the next bit is Minority Report. Um, if you consider yourself to be a member of any minority groups or otherwise marginalised group, what's that experience? Been And how can the university make things better for you and employers as well? I feel like in University, I did not raise it that much.

Um, I remember when I was on the UNICS Committee as well, there were a lot, my co-chair was a woman. There were a lot of girls on the committee as well. In fact, I think we were more girls than guys which was I think different from previous years but I feel like the work that we're doing and bringing more People interested in Computingly together and networking, that's happening at University.

Unless you saw books of Trend, isn't it? Because in in the department I think it's something like about 20 yes I feel like a more senior level at more management level and higher levels of responsibility. You see less and less women. While I was working at AWS as well.

I saw that more managers and more people at principal level were male, my manager, my mentor. And some other managers I was talking to With my friends, they were all male. But also like in University like I was saying I feel like some more lecturers are male and female but I feel like they're still a good balance and at least there is I haven't felt that there's any unconscious or conscious bias To gender, but I feel like it is Uh, prevalent in the workplace and also like at school level.

Uh when I was doing Computing in a levels, um, because after covid there was like less lab exposure, right? So we had an option to do the coding lab or not. So you go to a centre, you sit on your computer but you obviously have to have some practise before that.

To do it and only one other student did. But when I went to the centres, it's obviously people who really know how to code. And we're really interested and confident because you have an out and easy out of it because you're just going to get the average of the other grade if you don't do it.

So, I went there and I was like, I was there 15 minutes before the queueing time I was waiting there and then I was forcing Q. Like they weren't expecting a female so there was like no female like scanner thingies. So like there's a male person who scans like the males and the female person.

Yeah. And then I have to go to the back of the queue which was really disappointing. Because like, by that time it got pretty long It was also very discouraging. And at that point, I also saw like a very less growth who were doing Computing as a career. Some of them just were doing it as a subject because they didn't know something else to pick.

They were just doing it that way, and it's also true. And, like, here, I was doing some training programs and I came across some videos of British children, like school, small school children. I felt like technology was progressing faster here and sort of there would be more awareness. They were like ask questions, like do you think guys are smarter or girls are smarter?

And even the girls and the boys, both of them were like. Yeah, guys, do smart things like playing games and making games, and they were like, who do you think would be more likely to do like programming and Engineering? And they were like, yeah, guys, so I feel like it starts and that, like School level and we start to believe in our potential and like a certain direction and then we're not as likely to achieve as people who were told that they're like better because there are experiments that if you're told something, you end up doing that and being good at it and believing in that.

So that's where it starts. And it needs to be changed. Like, there needs to be Outreach programs to children at a school level, where they start to develop,

Career building and also like, I think at home. The kind of exposure that they get with parents, but that's not something that we can do anything about maybe more awareness. Well and I I know that Luis does like some Outreach programs. Dennis yeah yeah I remember I met The boy like in University here and told him about competing and and I know that she sends up people to volunteer in schools during them about Computing careers.

So I need string creates that we get more girls at University. Just being a female role model in school sailor. I'm somebody who's oh yeah, female models as well. The next thing is, um, I've just appointed you Vice Chancellor of the University. And I'd like to know what you do to improve. Teaching and learning University but obviously been exposed to a lot of teaching at the University and presumably there's been some variable quality there.

Um, What would you do to improve the teaching learning across University and perhaps not just in computer science. I mean, I think we can always get better at teaching it but Across the whole university because you're, I mean, you must be in touch with people who aren't studying computer science studying other subjects.

So I feel like I saw the importance of a more interdisciplinary approach to teaching and learning more after my student partnership role. Partnership was the that? What? That was that the thing you did at the end of the that was during term time. Yeah. Um, so I signed up for it at the end of first year and then I started the role in as part-time during second year, right?

And you were advising remind me which part of the University you're working with at that point Institute of teaching and learning. Right? So the one that I was partnering with my staff partner was John, who teaches So, you You were in, you were working with them. Make teaching better effectively.

Yes. So he had like a project in plan, so we were exploring marginality student marginality and coming up with teaching methods uh to make sure students marginize students. Like a better suit and their voices are like more Amplified and they feel more Central to the teaching and learning experience.

So the first part was obviously like exploring marginality the ideas of it, which kinds of students and what kinds of practises lead to feelings of marginality. And then it was more with coming up with tools. So one of the things that we introduced in his course was digital annotations that would help students like collaboratively annotate texts.

And like he could see their thoughts and have a more Hands-On approach and the students that don't feel so comfortable. And like speaking up during lectures hypothesis was it where you talk or hypothesis for that? Yes, and that's the tool that we did. You, what did you think of that?

I've not used it myself by. I know about it. I really liked it, but I also felt in the beginning. I felt that I was a little bit of a mismatch because, as a Computing student, it's not something that we do, like, critically analyse texts. We just look at it and it's the one thing that you have to believe in, because it's the right thing.

It's the logic, it's the Mac, it's the formula. But in literature there's a different approach. Everybody has a different opinion. And the lecture is not really like delivering, like teaching something to you that you need to learn as is it's more about having everything.

I feel like it did well on the course. But one, good thing that I was talking about, like, the interdisciplinary approach. Um, was that there was a lot of things that we in the School of Engineering or computer science. Have figured out which we could help, like other schools figure out.

And there are some things that other schools have and that we haven't. Yeah, for example, in business school. There's this thing called consultancy meetings. Where when, before submitting coursework, you have multiple opportunities of talking to your lecturer about it and them going through it with you. Is it a pre-marking?

It's not like marking, but they're like helping you find more resources, letting you where you could improve like they're not giving you like a mark of sorts and not saying that this is right, or this is wrong but like telling you areas where you could improve and sometimes it's just so daunting to find the right resources and come up with the right ideas and they're like helping you get there, right, which I feel is something so important.

And seeing that first year, students here at struggle a lot. I feel like there's a lot of work.

I had a lot of my friends who got caught in them. And these were people who had been like, Really like well mannered and like following all the rules and like, trying everything that they could. To grasp these Concepts. But I feel like the university takes it as Instead of like trying to make catching malpractice and like preventing it.

As having more strict measures like we need to take a step back and see. Why is it happening in the first place? What led these students to do these things? Instead of like becoming more strict about it, Uh, it's because we're taught something at like, so such a basic level.

Um, for me, I had python and my programming experience from before, but there were people who had never even opened a computer science textbook because the requirement is that you need to know math. Yeah, yeah. And it was really difficult for them to like Discord a game. And they end up doing these things.

Because it's, they need their grade. And it's like their first couple of assignments that they get in. It's not because like they want to engage in such practises. So I feel like some remodelling and taking some practises from other schools where there are these sessions. Where the lecturers are interacting with students to help them find the resources, find the right guidance because I do understand that they have a set of learning outcomes and they need to get the students up to that level before moving on to second year.

Maybe a little more support. Right consultancy? Well, the consultancy meetings. I didn't know about that. Sounds interesting. So I feel like in the school of computer science, one of my courses, like, ux Simon does post Consulting these sort of like where you get an assignment marked and then you can go to him book, a meeting and then get feedback and like, know why the marks were deducted.

So that in the next one, you don't repeat the same things. Yeah, that was personally very helpful for me because I was making some really simple errors that we're losing marks and then the next one, I didn't was perfect. Yeah. But there needs to be a pre one as well because for ux, it was different because you can submit like three to four essays but for things like programming where you have like one big coursework, I feel like there should be checkpoints at different times.

Ending this year and machine learning and I like proposed to change the lab structure which they're going to try next year and hopefully it will make things better. So, like the first half of the lab, Being more like the demonstration because when I was interacting with some students, they could not do basic things like renting a vector in like reverse order getting confused within dice's, basic things in Python.

Yeah. Know, by the end of that time. But then I propose like a more demo method where like the first half of the lab is demo so that more students feel like they're missing out on something and feel compelled to come. Yeah. And do something like that and then ask questions it was done in our cognitive robotics course.

And I saw that that lab was full we were in the mega lab like 1.8 and it was full Angela was it? Yeah, so basically he did a 30 minutes of a demonstration um and then we could ask questions for that 30 minutes of demonstration meant that we felt more comfortable to get started with the lab and we saw how to do it right, which I feel like if it's rolled on to more courses, it's really helpful.

And the other thing I would do was whilst Dancer are like, other than like,

You know, even if the edge chair where I, I think I delivered some training sessions and programming but nothing academic of sorts. So it was more like career, building events and extracurricular things. But I did work with the students unions. There's there's this academic research team that might get the data and statistics.

And while I was working with John to see some of these practises that we have in the School of Engineering and they don't have those Sample. One of the things is that our lecturers have a lot more freedom, in the types of Assessments that we have, like they have more freedom to design the coursework as they want and it keeps changing every year.

According to like the new, I think the industry requirements are like the new needs that they get feedback in the previous years. Introduce something new to the tag of assessment. First of all, it's standardised across the school so it has to be like a two years process and it's a fixed thing.

Like one essay with this many words and another essay with this many words, right? And the type of assessment is also completely fixed which is a bit counter effective because I get that. Standardisation is a nice thing and they want quality checks, but a lecture delivering the course knows how best to like, test their students on.

So I feel like a more interdisciplinary approach would help with that. And then the other thing I would do is have more focus on coursework and discourage long exams.

I feel that when I look at the knowledge that I've retained from all the courses I have, studied it's more from where I did coursework, like huge pieces of coursework Googling things, learning from online resources going to read papers, seeing projects and GitHub. And then getting my hands dirty, and like tinkering and making the projects myself.

One advantage is that when you go to interviews, you have a lot to talk about because of the practise in your portfolio. And the other thing is you've done it. So you actually remember it. And these are skills that are done your skills, whereas when you study something for an exam, it never becomes a skill other than just learning to memorise.

Well,

Yeah, 10 to 15 because we want to maximise the learning, right? And work courses where I had 100% exams. I feel like three months later. I don't even know what I studied like very little of it is retained. So I feel like the retention levels are much higher with larger projects and in some schools have started shifting their focus to like one week long.

Um, exams. Where students have a week to complete it. So they have more time to research. And, you know, when you research something and you're learning something, and the process of doing it, you remember more? Yeah, yeah. So that's another thing. So, the one issue of coursework is making it Um, Gen, AI proof.

So It needs to be carefully designed so that it can't just be something that you take the, take the task, and give it to Chad GPT and it'll chat. GPT comes up with something and sometimes, it'll create something that's quite good sometimes it won't, but you kind of Uh, you know, in at least, you know, in an exam that the person The thing that submitted the exam is hopefully, A human, right?

You don't always know that with coursework but there I mean there are ways of handling that but I think that's interesting. So more questions, of course, where you have to do multiple things and then put them together. Yeah. I mean like you're finding your projects a bit of a classic example of that, isn't it?

The thing that you'll remember years later is that project do like use large language models for that? And Jenny I for that, it's still a learning process. Yeah, and I feel like it's a very good way to adapt to the Future workplace. Yeah, because it helps you And a lot of our modules have that form where you say where you use AI in an interview that I did recently like where the University of Liverpool, they gave me a project that I had to do instead of like um doing the technical interview.

Um and then they asked me how much of it was Jenny on it and I was very honest. That the repeat took parts of the code I used from a large language model and they appreciated be honest, it's kind of interesting because there's two two. Um, Positions taken on coding interviews.

Now is one is you're not allowed to use geni and the other kind is you are allowed to use data nii and Conversation about that. How you used it? And You know, how did you validate what it gave you all that kind of stuff. Yes, employers are now in a very difficult place.

I've seen some really weird forms of assessment Ever since. Rise of like students using genai to craft applications. And sometimes it's effective, but sometimes I feel like they're missing out on video Talent but I guess it's a new like Revolution. Yeah, everyone's scratching their head. Yeah. Take time to adopt to it.

Okay, good. So thank you for that. So that more coursework you'd like to see more coursework and lots of good suggestions about how we can improve teaching and learning. So, the last one to finish up with is It's called one. Two, one podcast. One book. One film. We'll focus on one book and one film.

Yeah. Yeah. Um, so one book that you'd recommend listeners uh to read that you've enjoyed and why you've enjoyed it, one book that I recommend everybody who asks me to recommend a book is surely you're joking with refine, okay? To me by someone and when I read it I fell in love with it.

It's like it's also it has so much to learn from it, like, you just the advantages of having this playful and curious nature and not being afraid to ask any questions and like, not being afraid to shy away from like this standard ways of solving a problem and you don't expect a Nobel physicist to have that playful and curious mindset and like play off, all those pranks that he did and have such a good sense of humour because a physicist and a super smart person or like mathematicians, they're portrayed in like very different light.

Um, then when you get to know this person so I feel like it's a really good book to read, that's a good book. Thank you. Um,

A filmly recommend people go and watch. I recommend everybody Glendemporary one. Um, Big intern. The intern. Is that the Google one? Is that? No, no, there's no Google in it. There is there is there is a film called the internet. About working in a big tech company, but this is a different one.

It's a, it's not a big tech company, it's a startups. It's about the 70 year old intern. Uh, who joins this online fashion startup. It's like a tech fashion story, right? So the pins are like, around to this, the founder is a woman, so there's a lot of like a woman leadership but it's also like it has very comedy.

Um, Like feel to it and the 70-year-old person is Making like trying to make small difference comes with like 40 years of experience right now. Working as an intern. Yeah I saw relatable because I feel like sometimes when we join us interns, we also feel like there are all these people working in senior positions with your seniors of experience.

You're the most Junior person in the office. Nobody cares about your opinion. Um but there are these small things you can do to make a difference and then earn trust over time and that leads to getting more levels of responsibility. And Shouldn't like shy away from doing these smaller things and like, making our way up because this guy had like 70 years of sorry.

40 years of experience. He is 70 years old and then he starts out fresh and adapts his skills and later he ends up like helping her. Save the company from like Acquisition online because it's going in a very thoughts based world and he has a scam demeanour, so it's really interesting.

Good. And so, I haven't, I, I have to look at that. That sounds interesting. So thank you for our recommendation. Then, the last one is, um, Time traveller. So, to finish up with You've come to the end of your time here in Manchester. You're coming to graduation next month, and we look forward to celebrating that Um, if you could travel back in time to first year and meet yourself off that plane, From Pakistan.

What would you tell? What would you tell a younger anyhow? I think what I would tell myself and not tell other people by the way. Um, Is is to slow down a little, um, because I feel like when I started here, I was going like a bit too fast.

Like I Networking a bit too much. Like you should Network. Um, but also keep up with the connections that you make and make sure that not their quality networking and not quantity. Like I my first month here, I started delivering workshops with unisex, right? And then some of my friends felt so intimidated by that, but it was just, I was like on a roller coaster and then I remember one of my friends.

He was like, you literally, you're friends with everyone and I was like, no and I wasn't being modest. I was being very honest because I just, you know them, but you didn't. Yeah. Sometimes they know me because I'm meeting so many but like, they're not meeting as many people and I was like, friendly to like a wave level that you see them, you wave at them.

I was waving at everyone because I know all their faces and their names but that's about it. So those are not really connections. I was also like going to a lot of events like with booking, I also went to Google my first six months, by the way,

Yes, in a way, it was helpful but I feel like it's something that I could have done in third year. Not that it would have like, planted me in a completely different position but maybe it would Make things a bit more calm for me and giving me that diet to like, relax digest and do like more further things.

Yeah, definitely. Okay. I think it's good advice to slow down a bit to remind us all. We need to slow down a bit sometimes. Yeah. We're looking for this like immediate success and reaching our goals immediately. Why it needs to be like a slow process. Yeah, you've gone. You're playing a longer game.

Yeah. Um, thank you. I've been hell for coming on the show and uh for having me, we look forward to seeing you at graduation next month. Again, look forward to seeing you.
