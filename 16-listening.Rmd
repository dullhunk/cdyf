# Coding your future podcast {#listening}

This podcast features interviews with student as they come to end of their undergraduate degree or shortly after they graduate. We interview students to find out more about their journey from student to professional. During the interview, we ask students to tell us:

* What's their story? Tell us about themselves
* Where does their interest in computing come from
* Which organisation they were employed by, why and how did they chose them
* Tell us about their role in the organisation
* How did they find the job and what other jobs did they look for?
* What was the most enjoyable or rewarding part of working for their employer
* What advice would they give to students looking for placements
* What are their plans for the future
* Whatâ€™s the most interesting thing happening in computer science / technology right now?
* What are their favourite work related radio shows or podcasts?
