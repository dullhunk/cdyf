# (PART) DESIGNING YOUR FUTURE {-}


# Bothering with your future {#bothering}

The first half of this book is about designing your future. So before we get started, let's tackle a fundamental design issue. Why the hell would you want to bother with your future? Why should you bother with reading this pesky guidebook?

 * you are a busy person, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è
 * your time is a precious and finite resource, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è
 * you could be spending that precious time right now in lots of other ways, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è
 * there are mountains of self-help guides and courses already, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è
 * do you really need *yet another* guidebook? YES! ‚òëÔ∏è

You need this guidebook because it is different to all the other guidebooks! It will help you design, test, build and code your future in computing. Come with me [down the rabbit hole](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-h/11-h.htm#chap01) in Figure \@ref(fig:rabbit-fig) and let me explain... üêá

## What you will learn {#ilo1}
After reading this chapter you will be able to:

* Identify and decide which parts of this book you are going to read
* Set your expectations for using this guidebook
* Travel down the rabbit hole into the underworld of work


## Let's go down the rabbit hole {#wonderland}

In the novel *[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)* [@wonderland], the heroine Alice follows a [white rabbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rabbit) down a hole. What she discovers is a strange underground world populated by weird and wonderful characters. The world of work can sometimes be a mysterious underworld where you adventure in wonderland accompanied by colourful characters.

You will spend lots of time in this wonderland, potentially as much as 80,000 hours of your life. [@iip1; @iip2] So join me down the rabbit hole, it's fun honest, and sooner or later you'll have come down here anyway.

## Your future is your responsibility {#responsibility}
When [Andy Stanford-Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Stanford-Clark) started working at IBM, fresh out of University, his boss gave him the following advice:

> ‚ÄúNobody cares about your career except you.‚Äù ---Anon [@andystanfordclark]

Andy is now Master Inventor and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at IBM in the UK so it was probably good advice. Another, slightly more positive way of putting the advice is, the person who cares *most* about your career is you. So while there are people who can help design and build your future, ultimately it is **YOU** who has to take responsibility for the implementation (if you like, the code). The sooner you get coding the better.

At University, there are lots of people can help design and build your future: peers, academic staff, friends, your careers service, employers and your wider network but ultimately it is *your* responsibility to sort out whatever comes next. That might sound obvious but don't wait for somebody else to do it for you, because it probably won't happen.

## Your degree is not enough {#entitled}
You've worked incredibly hard to get the grades you needed to get into University. You've spent (or are spending) a significant amount of time and money studying whatever it is you are studying at University.

Under these circumstances, you might be tempted to believe that the world owes you something in return for your hard work. Unfortunately that's not the case.

At some point during or after your study, you might find yourself applying for a graduate job or graduate scheme. EVERYONE applying for these opportunities will have a degree or be rapidly on their way to getting one. So having a degree isn't going to set you apart much from your competition. Even having a first class degree [@gradeinflation; @firstclass] may not distinguish you that much your competitors. Some employers would rather not know (or don't care) what University you went to, so your education might not make you stand out as much as you might like anyway. [@bigfour]

What **will** distinguish you from your competitors will be your [experience](experiencing.html), your projects, your [communication skills](communicating.html) and any awards or honours you might have picked up along the way. If you think that your degree will be enough to get you the job you want, bear in mind that:

<!--Some employers are agnostic to where your degree came from, or how you did at high school, to your academic credentials

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/ey-firm-says-it-will-not-longer-consider-degrees-or-a-level-results-when-assessing-employees-10436355.html

1. There are more and more graduates, the UK for example recently passed the milestone of 50% of young people going into higher education. This compares to just 15% of over 18s who stayed in higher education in 1980 [@lotsofgrads]
1. The increase in the number of graduate schemes and graduate jobs has not kept pace with this growth in graduates which means that each graduate job or graduate scheme has more and more graduates applying for it
1. There are lots of graduates in your discipline, for example around 9,000 every year in Computer Science alone in the UK. What makes you different from the other 8,999 computer scientists graduating in your year?

  "2018",       50
)

ggplot(data = lotsofgrads) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percentage), stat = "identity")
```
(ref:captionlotsofgrads) Percentage of young people in the UK going into higher education between 1980 and 2018. Over the last forty years, the proportion of young people going into higher education has more than doubled from 15% in 1980 to over 50% in 2018. Data taken from BBC news article on [the symbolic target of 50% at university reached](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-49841620) [@lotsofgrads]

> Computing is one of the largest subject areas in UK higher education, and is taught in almost every institution, graduating around 9,000 students every year --Sally Fincher [@fincherreview]

Now, don't be disillusioned by the statistics because a degree can open doors to many careers in computing. What the data in Figure \@ref(fig:lotsofgrads-fig) show is that you'll need to look beyond your formal education to distinguish yourself from your competition. Your degree can certainly help you start a career, but it is typically not enough by itself.

## Maximise the return on your investment {#roi}
Studying at University is a significant investment of your time and money. Hopefully, you've picked a subject that stimulates and challenges you intellectually while allowing you to find and develop your unique talents. But there's another reason that you probably chose to study at University and that was to improve your job prospects. This guidebook will:

1. Help you maximise the return on the substantial investment of time and money ([ROI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment)) you've put into your study
1. Give you an overview of important professional issues that are sometimes neglected or sidelined in University curricula
1. Highlight and review essential resources beyond this guidebook that will help with the above

All of the resources that can help you are scattered around in lots of different places. There are books, there are videos, there are podcasts, there are websites and jobs boards. There are online courses, blogs, social media, newspaper columns, journal articles, marketing material and many other good resources. It can be overwhelming.

## Too late when you graduate {#thisstuffmatters}

You might be tempted to postpone making difficult career decisions. I'll do it tomorrow. I'll do it next week. I'll do it next year. I'll finish this assignment. I'll finish this exam. I'll finish this semester. Procrastination is a part of the human condition [@procrastination]:

>  ‚ÄúI'll get my degree out of the way first then worry about jobs and careers when I finish University‚Äù --P. Crastinator

It probably doesn't help that many of issues described and discussed in this book are typically not closely integrated into the curriculum in Higher Education. You'll often find them on the edges, or completely outside of, standard University curricula. Broadly speaking, the professional issues described in this book are usually covered by pastoral support systems, counselling services, careers services, trade organisations, professional bodies, student unions and their societies,.

Despite being sidelined, these issues matter and it is in your own selfish interests to start thinking about them right now. According to recent estimates by *Investors in People*, the average person spends **80,000 hours** working during their lifetime. [@iip2] So, *whatever* you end up doing after University, you'll be spending a lot of time doing it. Difficult decisions often get sidelined but it is never too early to start thinking about them and doing something. The sooner you start thinking about them the better decisions you'll make about what comes next. It's too late when you graduate.

That doesn't mean you have to know EXACTLY what you want to do when you finish. Lots of students don't and I certainly didn't when I graduated. I'd done a gap year teaching in India, two summer internships (in Sweden and the United States) and a year-in-industry in the UK and I *still* graduated with **no clue** as to what I wanted to do next! The important thing is that you make a start, and sometimes knowing what you **don't** want to do is just as valuable as knowing what you do.

<!--See the [I don't know what I want to do](#noclue) section.-->

Computer scientists call this problem ‚Äúsearch space reduction‚Äù, [@searchspace] because you have a [feasible region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region) of future possibilities and you need to narrow down the candidates. You could think of coding your future as an [optimisation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem). Start optimising now because it's too late when you graduate. üéì



## Yes, this WILL be on the exam {#exams}

Students love to ask their teachers ‚Äú*will this be on the exam*‚Äù? The short answer is **YES** (and **NO**)! Yes, this will be on the exam, but NO the exam won't be set by your University. Unlike other courses you've done, the examinations for this course aren't set by your University but by employers.  Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of examinations that you'll need to get good at, shown in Table \@ref(tab:examtable)

:  (\#tab:examtable) The "exams" used by employers, what gets assessed and the grades you can get

+---------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
| Examination         | What examiners are assessing               | Grade    |
+=====================+============================================+==========+
| CV, application form| - Should we invite you to interview ?      | pass/fail|
| covering letter     | - Can you communicate well in writing?     |          |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
| Interview           | - Should we offer you a job?               | pass/fail|
|                     | - Can you communicate well verbally?       |          |
|                     | - Can you communicate well nonverbally?    |          |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
| Employee performance| - Should we promote you?                   | pass/fail|
|                     | - Should we give you a pay rise?           |          |
|                     | - Should we extend your contract?          |          |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------+


So, *yes*, this will be on the exam, but *no*, the exams are obviously not set, administered, invigilated and marked by academics at your University. The exams are set by employers and the results are **brutally binary**:

* **PASS**: you've got the interview, job or promotion or...
* **FAIL**: none of the above. Next!

One of the challenging things about employers exams are, they typically do not have the bandwidth to give applicants useful feedback, other than a simple pass or fail. When it comes to job applications software engineer [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell) calls this the "black hole". The gravitational force of employers black holes is so strong that no CV or Resume can escape, we'll say more about this in chapter on [debugging your CV](#debugging).

```{r exam-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiongimme)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Gimme Some Credit - Sketch.png")
```
(ref:captiongimme) *no* this will not be on the exam set by University, but *yes* it will be on the exams set by employers. Some of the most important exams you sit at (and after) University are set by employers. This guidebook will help you prepare for those exams and increase your chances of passing them.

It's a similar story with interviews, if you fluffed and interview question or came across badly, it can be really difficult to find out from the employer what you did wrong.

## Get your hands dirty {#activities}
There are practical exercises, for you to get your hands dirty with. Each chapter incorporates activities including individual exercises, group exercises, quizzes and points for wider discussion. Just reading a guidebook won't get you very far, you'll need to do the activities in this book to get the most out of it.

## Navigate mountains of advice {#relatedwork}

There are **lots** of resources out there that offer self-help, career advice and techniques for self-improvement. It can be hard to know where to start, or even how to find your way around the mountains of advice.

```{r shelfie-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionshelfie)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/shelfie.jpg")
```
(ref:captionshelfie) There are tonnes of resources out there offering advice on the huge range of professional issues. You can't read them all, but this guide will help you navigate the resources that will be most interesting and useful to you

Lots of professional advice is readily available, but how will you navigate it? This book signposts you to what I think are the most important resources, each chapter has a signposts section, and they are all gathered together in the signpost at the end alongside everything (yes, EVERYTHING!) that this guidebook cites in the [References](#references).

## This book is different {#thinkdifferent}

I wrote this guidebook because I needed a resource for students to help them design, build, test and debug their futures. I wanted a single resource that could help students compete for jobs while at University, or shortly after graduating. I could not find anything suitable that met all the requirements of the students I was teaching. So I wrote this one which contains some new material and recommends the best resources if you want to know more. These are found in the signposts sections of each chapter.

<!--Good though these many resources are, they all have their own limitations. Some have dated quickly and are not refreshed, others are published under a restrictive copyright licenses that can prevent reuse, sharing and access. Some resources only tackle a single issue, while many can't easily be adapted for your own needs. -->

<!--Others neglect the student voice or fail to tell the story of students with first-hand experience of a rapidly changing and sometimes brutally competitive job market. Many are written from the point of view of employers, recruiters or careers advisors [@samfranklin]. These people all have valuable advice for students but they often lack first hand experience of working in a given sector and in some cases are trying sell you something! Another common shortcoming is excluding all parts of the story which combine four overlapping perspectives:

1. Students and recent graduates
1. Employers and recruiters
1. Careers advisors, authors and journalists
1. Scientists and engineers, in industry and academia-->

This book aims to combine these perspectives and to be different from existing resources in the following ways:

### Well signposted {#signposted}
Some career resources claim (or imply) that they are the *all you will need* to solve a particular problem or worse: solve *all of your problems*! Just buy this book, do this course, watch this video, listen to this podcast and all your problems will go away!  Rather than continue this trend, this book **signposts** some of the most useful resources. <!--We don't want to re-invent the wheel but signpost useful wheels that other people have already made. -->

Scientists call this **citation**, rather than signposting. I've signposted and cited sources in this guidebook so that you can :

1. Check and verify any facts and claims I make in this book for yourself
1. Go and consult the original sources if you think they might be useful

While this guidebook cites lots of resources, some of them are more important than others. Each chapter summarises these in a signposts section. You'll find everything else in the [references](#referencing) section. The University of Manchester has physical and electronic copies of many (but sadly not all) of the books listed here.

<!--If you're studying at the University of Manchester, these signposts are available as a library reading list at [library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/reading-lists](https://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/reading-lists).-->

We're not suggesting that you read *all* these books right now, but that if a particular chapter has piqued your interest, these signposts are good places to keep going, if you haven't already read them. I hope you'll find these signposts handy for navigating the mountains of advice. Not all who wander are lost. üó∫Ô∏èüß≠

### Your future guidebook  {#study}
This guidebook to your future accompanies a course that has been co-designed by students for students, with input from academics and employers. It unites several disparate themes into one coherent story, from fundamental questions about identity and wellbeing through to more applied and practical advice on job hunting, career progression and life after University. Resources that do this are typically scattered around in many different places. There is usually no narrative to tie them all together to help students navigate the mountains of advice as embark on the first stages of their careers.

Although this is a course guidebook used in the second year undergraduate teaching, you don't need to be enrolled on the course to benefit from reading it, watching the videos and doing the exercises and coding challenges.

### Your future is constantly updated {#updates}
You are reading the alpha version, the [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP) of this guidebook. That's software engineer talk for saying it isn't finished yet. Subsequent versions, will be continuously and iteratively released on a daily and weekly basis. They will include:

* More quizzes for better interactivity
* More videos on the [Coding your Future YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLBv_u8JmyUPqmRALIjVnLg)
* Audio podcasts in the [Coding your Future](#listening)
* More illustrations throughout the book
* Improved content, finish incomplete chapters
* Fix bugs and typos
* Your [suggestions for improvements and corrections, via github etc]({#joinus})

I'm taking a [Release Early, Release Often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often) [@Raymond1999] approach to publishing this guidebook, you could call it agile book development. [@realagile]

```


### I'm deliberately writing in first person narrative
A lot of scientific and technical writing is written in the third person or passive voice, which is fine for academic writing, but can alienate readers. I have opted to use first person narrative where possible as it is shorter, and hopefully more engaging for you to read. [@googler] Where relevant, I've told stories to illustrate key points.

### Your future has no paywall {#openaccess}
You don't need to pay anything to read this book online because its openly available, see the [license terms](#licensing) (CC-BY-NC-ND). Publishing this guidebook online makes it findable and accessible, something that isn't true of lots of knowledge locked up inside other books.

Because this guidebook is online, it is searchable, browsable and linkable. You can link to whatever level you like, top level, chapter level and to every section and subsection level. Everything important has a Uniform Resource Locator ([URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL)).

## Signposts from here {#sign1}

Each chapter in this book has a signposts section, highlighting key activities or reading you can do from here. This chapter has addressed the question of **why should you bother coding your future**? The answer is that your future is your responsibility and no-one elses. There are lots of people can help shape your future, but none more than yourself. Software engineer [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) argues this point in his book *The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers*. [@cleancoder]

What's good about *The Clean Coder* is that it is short (only 200 pages), well written and to the point. The main part of the book covers professional issues in software engineering, some of which I discuss in [your survival and promotion](#surviving), so *The Clean Coder* is an essential signpost for chapter 10 as well.


## Summarising this book {#tldr1}

If all that was [too long, didn't read](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read) (TL;DR) for you, then you'll be relieved to hear that each chapter (including this one) has a TL;DR summary.

```{r tldr-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiontldr)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/TLDR.png")
```

The TL;DR for this chapter is, you should read this guidebook because it will help you design, build, test, debug and code your future in computing.
