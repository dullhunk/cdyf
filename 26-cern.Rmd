# Opportunities with CERN {#cern}

Did you know that CERN employs **ten times more engineers** and technicians than research physicists, see figure \@ref(fig:cern3-fig). For physicists to understand the data that pours off the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) (LHC), you need armies of engineers to enable the scientists to do their work. A *lot* of those engineers are working on hardware and software, and most of them won't be physicists. [@hullcern]

Working at CERN is your chance to gain hands-on experience at one of the world’s leading centres for scientific research. Whether you're an aspiring engineer, physicist, or developer, this programme will provide you with unparalleled exposure to cutting-edge technology and the chance to work alongside top experts in your field.

##  Next deadline 23rd Feb 2026

CERN has several rounds of applications every year for year-long placements (what they call `technical studentships`) in engineering and allied disciplines. The next deadline for applications is 23rd Feb 2026.
