# Actioning your future {#actioning}

Employers are often more interested in what you have *done*, rather than just what you *know*. Your actions are a key part of your story we discussed in section \@ref(carstar). A good technique for emphasising your actions is to lead the description of it with carefully chosen verbs. This is useful technique in CVs and resumes which will highlight what you *actually done* rather than what you think you *know* or understand. See the verbs first section \@ref(verbsfirst) of chapter \@ref(debugging) *debugging your future*.


## Your actions define your impact {#impact}
Your actions define your impact, see figure \@ref(fig:action-fig). Think about the stories you can tell, the context, action and result (CAR) we discussed in section \@ref(carstar).

```{r action-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionactions)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/your-actions.png")
```
(ref:captionactions) What actions have you taken and what stories do they tell about the results and your impact?
