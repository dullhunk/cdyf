# Broadening your future {#broadening}

Do you feel like the *weird edge case* pictured in Figure \@ref(fig:default-user-fig)? Do typical graduate destinations such as large multi-national corporations, not really make you want to *[Shake Your Thang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_Your_Thang)*? [@saltnpepa] Perhaps you want to:

* use your technical skills responsibly and ethically to make the world a better place?
* start your own business and make money for yourself, rather than other people?
* work in computing in roles outside of classic software engineering?

This chapter on your alternatives will broaden your horizons and get you to think about some of the less obvious options, because I *love* weird edge cases and you should too. ðŸ˜»

```{r default-user-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captiondefaultuser)"}

```

(ref:captiondefaultuser) Are you a weird edge case? By default, many graduates choose a graduate scheme with big brand, often a [blue-chip multinational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_chip_(stock_market)) employer. While working for these kind of employers has many benefits, they are not the whole story. This chapter looks at some of the alternatives.

Many technology jobs exist outside of technology companies, [@outsideit] because a lot of software is written to be used rather than sold. Consequently, many employers create bespoke software to fit their own business needs. The people who build are often employees that given organisation, rather than people employed by a technology company. In the United States for example, ninety percent of IT jobs are outside the traditional tech industry. Technical jobs outside the technology sector often have the advantage of being more accessible than those within a very competitive technology sector. [@burninglass]

Computer programs deeply transform science. Beyond every recent scientific discovery there is digital data and programs to analyze, store, make sense of reality through computers. NumPY is one such computer program that has been developed over the last decade, becoming an essential instrument for key discoveries in astronomy, chemistry or biology.

## With great code comes great responsibility {#greatcode}

Computer scientists wield tremendous power in the twenty first century. We know that:

* With great power comes great responsibility [@spiderman]
* With great code comes great responsibility [@responsiblecs]

Given the growing power of computing in the twenty-first century, computer scientists have a duty to society to use that power responsibly and justly. How can they do so?

```{r soul-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionsoul)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Sell your soul.png")
```

(ref:captionsoul) Do you need to sell your soul to your employer? If so, how much can you get for it? What percentage stake of your soul will they ask for and how much are you willing to give? How do your values align with those of your employer?

* Teaching: coding their future

The computer scientist [Simon Peyton Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Peyton_Jones) explains why teachers of computing are crucial from primary school through to secondary school and beyond. Can you inspire the next generation with your knowledge of computing? ,

Teaching is not a delivery system, it's an art form.

```{r teach-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionkenrob)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ken-robinson-teaching.png")
```

(ref:captionkenrob) According to [Ken Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Robinson_(educationalist)), teaching is an art form. [@kills1; @kills2] Are you an artist? There is significant demand for artists like you who can teach computing to the next generation. You don't even need to have studied Computer Science to become a teacher of computing.
