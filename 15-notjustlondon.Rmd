# Not Just London {#notjustlondon}

A simple way to improve your job prospects is to [broaden and deepen your job search](searching.html). One of the [ten simple rules for coding your future](ruling.html), is to look beyond obvious employers and locations for jobs and [consider all the alternatives](broadening.html).

For example, if you're seeking work or further study in the United Kingdom, there are lots of possibilities in [Loxbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxbridge) (London, Oxford and Cambridge). While Loxbridge undoubtedly offers many fantastic opportunities for professional growth and development, it does not represent *all* of the best opportunities that exist in the UK.

So, it's wrong to assume that capital cities like London are where *all* the best opportunities are. That's true in the UK and also in many other countries too.

(ref:captionnojustlondon) Like many capital cities, London dominates the economy of its country. There are clearly some fantastic employers offering great opportunities in London but they do not represent everything that is on offer in the UK. There are plenty of good career options outside of capital cities like London if you don't want to live and work in a huge metropolis. Not just London Image by Sharon Dale [@notjustlondon]
