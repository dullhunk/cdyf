Hello and welcome to <em>Coding Your Future</em> (<a href="https://www.cdyf.me">cdyf.me</a>) the guidebook that will help you to design, engineer, test and <code>code</code> your future in computing. Also published at <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/cdyf.pdf">cdyf.pdf</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/cdyf.epub">cdyf.epub</a>, this book is aimed at ALL students in higher education. While the guide supports undergraduate teaching at the University of Manchester, it doesn’t actually matter:</p>
<ul>
<li>what <em>stage</em> of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year</li>
<li>what <em>level</em> you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate</li>
<li>what <em>subject</em> you are studying, as long as you are <strong>computationally curious</strong>
</li>
<li>what <em>institution</em> you are studying at, this book is University and institution agnostic</li>
<li>
<em>where</em> in the world you are studying</li>
</ul>
<p>There is something in this guidebook for <em>any</em> student of computing, both those inside and outside of Computer Science departments. 👨🏿‍💻👨‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩‍💻👩🏿‍💻</p>

<p>This is a self-help guide but a lot of self-help literature can be dry, dull, textbooky, generic and boring with few illustrations and conversations. In the novel <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</a></em> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-wonderland" role="doc-biblioref">Caroll 1865</a>)</span> shown in figure <a href="index.html#fig:aiw-fig">0.1</a>, the protagonist Alice wonders why her sister is reading a book without pictures.</p>

<p>This guidebook aims to help you develop stronger habits of mind, body and soul using five key ingredients:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong><code>CODE</code></strong>: Instructions, algorithms, recipes and strategies contained in this guidebook. This <code>code</code> is for your consumption, not for a machine.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>DATA</code></strong>: Facts, statistics, graphs and pictures collected together for your analysis</li>
<li>
<strong><code>YOU</code></strong>: Activities for you to do in addition to reading</li>
<li>
<strong><code>FUTURES</code></strong>: Possible futures for you to think about. Try not to dwell on the past. Think about the future. Think about <em>your</em> future. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-thinkaboutthefuture" role="doc-biblioref">Ryder 1988</a>, <a href="reading.html#ref-wroteforluck" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>

<p>Coding your future explores techniques for making career decisions, job searching, submitting applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace.</p>
<p>Alongside these practical engineering issues, this guidebook also encourages you to <em>design your future</em> by taking a step back and reflecting on the bigger picture. You will apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking">computational thinking</a> techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people and what your experience is. As there is a computational theme, you will also need to reflect on what your inputs and outputs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output">I/O</a>) are, both now and in the future. You’ll also need to think about what recipes (or algorithms) you might start experimenting with</p>
<p>This guidebook tackles professional and pastoral issues in computing, for those with and without Computer Science degrees in the early stage of their careers.</p>
<!--We will also discuss some algorithms (recipes) that you might like to try-->
</div>
<div id="nilo" class="section level2" number="0.3">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">0.3</span> What you won’t learn<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#nilo"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This guidebook will NOT teach you how to write code, there’s already lots of fantastic resources to help you do that. We discuss some of them in chapter <a href="computing.html#computing">6</a> on <em>computing your future</em>.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">0.4</span> Learning your future<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bilo"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>So what <em>will</em> you learn from this guidebook? After reading this guidebook, watching the videos and doing the exercises you will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Improve your self-awareness by describing who you are, what motivates you and your strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li>Decide on a job search strategy and identify employers, sectors and roles that are of interest to you<br>
</li>
<li>Improve your written communication skills both for job applications and communicating with other people</li>
<li>Plan and prepare competitive written applications using standard techniques including CVs, covering letters, application forms and digital profiles</li>
<li>Compete successfully in interviews and assessment centres by preparing for technical and non-technical questions</li>
<li>Plan further steps in your career such as promotion, postgraduate study &amp; research, alternative employment and longer term goals</li>
<li>Search and navigate a large “wordbase” (this guidebook and the work it cites). A wordbase is like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebase"><code>codebase</code></a>, only written predominantly in natural language.</li>
</ol>
<!--codebase, documentbase, languagebase, wordbase--><div id="prereq" class="section level3" number="0.4.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">0.4.1</span> Your future requirements<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prereq"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>As the title of this guidebook implies, there is a computational flavour here, but you do not have to be studying Computer Science to benefit. There are two main target audiences for this guidebook:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of their degree. This includes software engineering, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction (HCI), information systems, health informatics, data science, gaming, cybersecurity and all the other myriad flavours of Computer Science</li>
<li>Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying <em>any</em> subject, with little or no Computer Science at all. You are curious to know about what role computing could play in your future career because computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists, see chapter <a href="computing.html#computing">6</a> on <em>Computing your Future</em>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So the prerequisites for this book are that you are studying (or have studied) at University where English is one of the main spoken languages. You <em>may</em> have some experience already, either casual, voluntary or otherwise, but this book does <strong>not</strong> assume that you have already been employed in some capacity.</p>
</div>
<div id="gut" class="section level3" number="0.4.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">0.4.2</span> Gutting your future<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#gut"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Reading this book from cover to cover like a novel is not recommended. That would be foolish.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:gut-fig"></span>
<img src="images/fish-gutting.jpeg" alt="Don’t read this book, disembowel it! Eviscerate it! Gut it like a fish!

</p>
</div>

<p>Instead of reading this book, I suggest you follow the advice given to historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodruff">William Woodruff</a> about reading books when he was at University:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You don’t READ books, you GUT them!” <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-nabend" role="doc-biblioref">Woodruff 2003</a>)</span> 🐟</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, gut this book like the fish in figure <a href="index.html#fig:gut-fig">0.3</a>. Identify the chapters that are most useful to you (the flesh), and skip the rest (the guts). Which chapters are flesh and which are guts will depend on what stage of the journey you are at. This guidebook is designed to be as “guttable” as possible. To aid gutting, the version published at <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/">cdyf.me</a> has a built in search and tables of contents. Before you can gut the fish, you’ll need an anatomical map shown in figure <a href="index.html#fig:map-fig">0.4</a>.</p>

<p>This guidebook is split into three parts. The first part (Chapters <a href="rebooting.html#rebooting">1</a> to <a href="computing.html#computing">6</a>) is on design while the second part (chapters <a href="debugging.html#debugging">7</a> to <a href="researching.html#researching">13</a>) is on building and testing your future shown in the map in figure <a href="index.html#fig:map-fig">0.4</a>. The final part is a help section for supporting your future (chapters <a href="ruling.html#ruling">14</a> to <a href="reading.html#reading">20</a>). Let’s look in a bit more detail at the content of each of the three parts of this guidebook:</p>

<p>Building a career isn’t that different to building anything else, you’ll need to do some design work and it will probably be iterative. Designing things often involves answering tricky questions. So when you’re designing your future you’ll need to cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter <a href="rebooting.html#rebooting">1</a>: <em>Rebooting your future</em> discusses why you should bother reading this guidebook</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="knowing.html#knowing">2</a>: <em>Knowing your future</em> challenges you to reflect on who you are, what makes you unique and why you are here</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="nurturing.html#nurturing">3</a>: <em>Nurturing your future</em> encourages you to take care of your mental and physical health</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="writing.html#writing">4</a>: <em>Writing your future</em> explores your soft skills, and how they complement your hard skills and why employers value them so much</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="experiencing.html#experiencing">5</a>: <em>Experiencing your future</em> asks you to reflect on your work experience and help identify where you can improve it</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="computing.html#computing">6</a>: <em>Computing your future</em> looks at the role computing can play in your career, especially if Computer Science is not a major part of your degree</li>

<p>I’m looking for feedback and contributions on everything in this guidebook from the small things like typos, grammatical errors and spelling mistakes through to bigger issues for each chapter such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the chapter make sense, is it clear?</li>
<li>Does it strike the right tone, is it pitched at the right level? Not patronising? Too many platitudes?</li>
<li>Are there too many motivational (or <a href="https://despair.com/collections/demotivators">demotivational</a>) quotations?</li>
<li>Where is it too long and waffly (see figure <a href="debugging.html#fig:shorterletter-fig">7.14</a>) or too short?</li>
<li>Are there too many (or too few) pictures? What needs more illustration?</li>
<li>Is it well scoped? Too broad or too narrow?</li>
<li>Are the stated learning objectives met by the chapter?</li>
<li>Are the activities clear? Can students understand why the activities are recommended? What other activities could be added?</li>
<li>Will it make sense to global readers e.g. will students from America, China and India etc understand the quirks and idioms of English language and culture</li>
<li>Are there too many metaphors? Mixed metaphors? Awkward analogies? Idiotic idioms? Annoying alliterations?</li>
<li>Too many citations? Not enough citations? Missed any key citations?</li>
<li>What’s missing?</li>
<li>Where are the unstated assumptions? Where is the unconscious bias?</li>
<li>What are the issues with equality, diversity and inclusion?</li>
<li>Are there too many musical references or annoying emoji? Please bear in mind I’m trying to strike an irreverent, light-hearted and playful tone to improve readability 😜</li>
<li>What else should be ruthlessly edited out?</li>
</ul>

<p>The content of this book is based on hundreds of conversations I have had with students of Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics and Engineering, since 2012. It is also based on conversations I’ve had with many of their employers too.</p>

<p>This acknowledgements section is long because I try to practice what I preach about the importance of expressing gratitude, see section <a href="nurturing.html#lays">3.3</a>. It also serves as a live demonstration of a public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal">gratitude journal</a>. Showing gratitude, publicly and privately, is a simple and proven technique for improving your mental health. It will also improve the mental health of the people who you thank, see <a href="nurturing.html#signposts3">3.6</a>.</p>

<p>So, if you have studied some flavour of Computer Science at the University of Manchester since 2012, there’s a high probability you have contributed to this book. Thank you for having the courage to tell me your stories. Thank you for being ambitious, hard working, talented, fearless, creative, inspirational and listening to me (sometimes). It has been my pleasure and privilege to work with you all.</p>
<p>I’d especially like to thank industrial experience (IE) students who have completed a year in industry as part of their degree as well as those who have done summer internships, either as part of the Master of Engineering (MEng) program or otherwise, particularly <a href="https://github.com/samialabed">Sami Alabed</a>, Luke Beamish, Eirik Björnerstedt, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDmn8CxaXGxZSKq83vhzULw">Petia Davidova</a> and Kristina Radinova. In addition, the <a href="http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk">PASS leaders</a> and facilitators, <a href="https://unicsmcr.com/">UniCSmcr.com</a>, <a href="https://github.com/unicsmcr/hacksoc.com">HackSoc</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cssoc">CSSoc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Man-UP">Manchester Ultimate Programming</a> members have all been influential on the content of this book. I’ve learned heaps by manually trawling through thousands of your CVs too, so if you’ve shown me a copy of your CV, thanks! If you sent me a CV and I didn’t reply, I apologise. There are limits to what is humanly possible. Chapter <a href="debugging.html#debugging">7</a> on <em>Debugging your future</em> (self assessment) and chapter <a href="hacking.html#hacking">15</a> on <em>Hacking your future</em> (peer assessment) are based on the most common bugs (or are they features?) I’ve seen in CVs.

<p>Thanks to Niall Beard and <a href="https://github.com/sharifsalah">Sharif Salah</a> at Google for introducing me to Google’s Technical Writing course. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-googling" role="doc-biblioref">A. Googler 2019</a>)</span></p>
<p>So, thanks employers for employing our students. 🙏</p>

<span class="header-section-number">0.8.3</span> Thank you colleagues<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#colleagues"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>I’ve also had significant support from colleagues in the Department of Computer Science (<a href="https://twitter.com/csmcr">@csmcr</a>) and support staff at the University of Manchester. (<a href="https://twitter.com/UoMCareers">@UoMCareers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alumniUoM">@alumniUoM</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialUoM">@OfficialUoM</a>)</p>
<p>I would especially like to thank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_John_Miles">Jim Miles</a> for encouraging me to write a book shortly after he offered me a job. I thought he was joking (about the book) but it actually turned out to be another one of Jim’s great ideas. Thanks Jim. 🙏</p>
<p>I’d also like to thank the only three people in the whole world who’ve had the misfortune of reading all of my PhD thesis; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_David_Stevens">Robert Stevens</a>, <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/anilwipat.html">Anil Wipat</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Pettifer">Steve Pettifer</a>. I suspect it was as painful for you to read as it was for me to write it. Thanks Robert for your relentless patience and giving me a well timed, well aimed kick up the (proverbial) arse to write this book in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Hotel,_Manchester">Midland Hotel, Manchester</a> at the May ball.</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber">Steve Furber</a> for playing bass guitar in our “boy band” <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/research.html#tuningcomplete">Tuning Complete</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Goble">Carole Goble</a> for patiently re-teaching me how to write by covering early drafts of my MSc thesis in red ink and less patiently (on subsequent revisions) swear words. 🤬</p>
<p>So, thank you colleagues for being collegiate. You make the University of Manchester an enjoyable place to work.</p>

<p>Bryan is an artist, visual thinker, entrepreneur and listener who turns stories into pictures. He also happens to have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Glasgow. As a renaissance man, his combined skills in art, science and engineering made him the perfect fit for illustrating this guidebook. You can find out more about Bryan at <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">bryanmathers.com</a> and <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">visualthinkery.com</a>. I’m <em>sooo</em> glad we randomly bumped into each other at a conference.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">0.9</span> About me<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#duncan"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/">Duncan Hull</a> and I wrote this guidebook for undergraduate and postgraduate students as part of my job at the University of Manchester where I’m a lecturer (≈ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_professor">Assistant Professor</a>) in the <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">Department of Computer Science</a>.</p>
<p>So what’s <em>my</em> story? Like many people, my path has been what <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenTupper">Helen Tupper</a> and Sarah Ellis call a “<a href="https://www.amazingif.com/books/">squiggly career</a>” rather than classic linear one. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-squigglybook" role="doc-biblioref">Tupper and Ellis 2020</a>, <a href="reading.html#ref-squigglytalk" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> I’ve been gainfully employed as a paperboy, supermarket cashier, shelf stacker, sausage packer, computer hacker, pork pie filler, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plongeur">plongeur</a>, chef, dogsbody, field assistant, database administrator, deli counter server, consultant, matchday steward, envelope stuffer, high school teacher, postdoc, research scientist, chairperson, software engineer, lecturer, external examiner, tutor and scholar.</p>
<p>I’ve done a range of voluntary work too, serving as a competition judge, fundraiser, <a href="https://codeclub.org">code club</a> &amp; <a href="https://coderdojo.com">coderdojo</a> leader, rabble rouser, <a href="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/">digital council</a> member, <a href="https://governorsforschools.org.uk/">school governor</a>, curator, librarian, beer drinker, <a href="https://wiki-loves-scientists.org.uk/">wikipedia trainer</a>, <a href="https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">journal clubber</a> and editor. But as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Lane">Ronnie Lane</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Wood">Ronnie Wood</a> (figure <a href="index.html#fig:faces-fig">0.37</a>) once said:</p>

Figure 0.37: Hindsight is a great teacher. I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_La_La_(Faces_song)">Ooh La La</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-faces" role="doc-biblioref">Lane and Wood 1973</a>)</span> I’ve written some of what I know now in this guidebook, I hope you find it useful.
</p>
</div>

<p>This guidebook documents some of what I know now, that I wish I’d known, when I was younger. If you’re starting your career, I hope you find these insights and exercises useful. I’ve sat on both sides of the interview table, as interviewer and interviewee. I have had some spectacular failures, alongside some modest successes, and have included personal stories where they are relevant.</p>
<p>Most of what I have learned about employment comes from listening to, and watching students interact with employers as they take the first tentative steps in their careers. I’ve documented some of what they taught me, so reading this book may help you learn from some of their successes and failures.</p>
