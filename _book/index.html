Hello and welcome to Coding Your Future, the guidebook that will help you to design, build, test, debug and code your future in computing. This guidebook is aimed at students in higher education, both those studying Computer Science as part of their degree or those from other disciplines with an interest in computing.</div>
<p>This guidebook supports second year teaching at the University of Manchester, but it DOES NOT MATTER:</p>
<ul>
<li>what <em>stage</em> of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year</li>
<li>what <em>level</em> you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate</li>
<li>what <em>subject</em> you are studying, provided that you are computationally curious</li>
<li>what <em>institution</em> you are studying at, this book is University and institution agnostic</li>
<li>
<em>where</em> in the world you are studying</li>
</ul>
<p>So there is something in this guidebook for every student of computing. üåéüåçüåè</p>

<span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Aims of Coding your Future<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#vaccine"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This guidebook will help you develop healthier habits of mind, body and soul using five key ingredients:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>C</strong>ode: Instructions in this guidebook</li>
<li>
<strong>D</strong>ata: You‚Äôll need to analyse and understand data</li>
<li>
<strong>Y</strong>ou: This guidebook needs you to do things</li>
<li>
<strong>F</strong>utures: Think about the future, rather than dwelling on the past.
<ul>
<li>bothering with the future, knowing your future, looking after your future, communicating your future, experiencing your future, computing your future, debugging your future, finding your future, speaking your future, broadening and researching your future,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>M</strong>e: Hello, my name is Duncan. I‚Äôm your tour guide here.</li>
</ol>
<p>Coding your future explores techniques for making career decisions, job searching, submitting applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace.</p>
<p>Alongside these practical engineering issues, this guidebook also encourages you to <em>design your future</em> by taking a step back and reflecting on the bigger picture. You will apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking">computational thinking</a> techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people and what your experience is. As there is a computational theme, you will also need to reflect on what your inputs and outputs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output">I/O</a>) are, both now and in the future. You‚Äôll also need to think about what recipes (or algorithms) you might start experimenting with</p>
<p>This guidebook tackles professional issues in computing, for those with and without Computer Science degrees in the early stage of their careers.</p>
<!--We will also discuss some algorithms (recipes) that you might like to try-->
</div>
<div id="bilo" class="section level2" number="0.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> What you will (and won‚Äôt) learn<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bilo"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>After reading this guidebook, watching the videos and doing the exercises you will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Improve your self-awareness by describing who you are, what motivates you and your strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li>Decide on a job search strategy and identify employers, sectors and roles that are of interest to you<br>
</li>
<li>Improve your written communication skills both for job applications and collaborating with other people</li>
<li>Plan and prepare competitive written applications using standard techniques including CVs, covering letters, application forms and digital profiles</li>
<li>Compete successfully in interviews and assessment centres by preparing for technical and non-technical questions</li>
<li>Plan further steps in your career such as promotion, postgraduate study &amp; research, alternative employment and longer term goals</li>
</ol>
<p>This book will NOT teach you how to write code, there‚Äôs already lots of fantastic resources to help you do that. We discuss some of them in chapter six <a href="computing.html#computing">Computing Your Future</a>.</p>
<div id="prereq" class="section level3" number="0.2.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">0.2.1</span> Prerequisites<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prereq"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>As the title of this guidebook implies, there is a computational flavour here, but you do not have to be studying Computer Science to benefit. There are two main target audiences for this guidebook:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of their degree. This includes software engineering, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction (HCI), information systems, health informatics, data science, gaming, cybersecurity and all the other myriad flavours of Computer Science</li>
<li>Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying <em>any</em> subject, with little or no Computer Science at all. You are curious to know about what role computing could play in your future career because computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the prerequisites for this book are that you are studying (or have studied) at University where English is one of the main spoken languages. You <em>may</em> have some experience already, either casual, voluntary or otherwise, but this book does <strong>not</strong> assume that you have already been employed in some capacity.</p>
</div>
<div id="gut" class="section level3" number="0.2.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">0.2.2</span> Don‚Äôt read this, gut it!<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#gut"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>I don‚Äôt recommend you read this book from cover to cover in one sitting. Instead, I suggest you follow the advice given to historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodruff">William Woodruff</a> about reading books when he was at University:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt READ books, you GUT them!‚Äù <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-nabend" role="doc-biblioref">Woodruff 2003</a>)</span> üêü</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, gut this book like a fish. Identify the chapters that are most useful to you (the flesh), and skip the rest (the guts). Which chapters are flesh and which are guts will depend on what stage of the journey you are at. This guidebook is designed to be as ‚Äúguttable‚Äù as possible.
To aid gutting, the version published at <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/">cdyf.me</a> has a built in search and tables of contents. Before you can gut the fish, you‚Äôll need a map.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">0.3.1</span> Designing your future<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parti"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The first part of this guidebook (chapters 1 to 6) looks at what engineers call <em>design</em>. When you build anything, a bridge, a piece of software, a car or a plane you‚Äôll need to do some design. Building a career isn‚Äôt that different to building anything else, you‚Äôll need to do some design work and it will probably be iterative. Designing things often involves asking tricky questions. So when you‚Äôre designing your future you‚Äôll need to cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="bothering.html">Bothering with your future</a> looks at why you should bother reading any of this book</li>
<li>
<a href="knowing.html">Knowing your future</a> challenges you to reflect on who you are, what makes you unique and why you are here</li>
<li>
<a href="wellbeing.html">Looking after your future</a> encourages you to take care of your mental and physical health</li>
<li>
<a href="communicating.html">Communicating your future</a> explores your soft skills, and how they complement your hard skills and why employers value them so much</li>
<li>
<a href="experiencing.html">Experiencing your future</a> asks you to reflect on your work experience and help identify where you can improve it</li>
<li>
<a href="computing.html">Computing your future</a> looks at the role computing can play in your career, with or without a Computer Science degree</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">0.3.2</span> Building and testing your future<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#partii"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The next six chapters look at building and testing your future, what engineers like to call <em>implementation</em> or <em>execution</em>. Once you‚Äôve started to answer the design questions in the first part, you can start to implement (or build) your career and think about what the next steps will be.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="debugging.html">Debugging your future</a> looks at debugging your written communication such as covering letters, application forms and digital portfolios.</li>
<li>
<a href="finding.html">Finding your future</a>, looks at where and how can you look for interesting opportunities</li>
<li>
<a href="interviewing.html">Speaking your future</a>, looks how can you turn interviews to your advantage and negotiate any offers you receive</li>
<li>
<a href="surviving.html">Surviving your future</a> looks at the next steps. Once you‚Äôve landed a job, how will you survive and thrive outside (and after) University</li>
<li>
<a href="studying.html">Researching your future</a> discusses if a Masters degree or a PhD right for you?</li>
<li>
<a href="broadening.html">Broadening your future</a> encourages you to broaden your horizons. Maybe you want to start your own business and employ others or you‚Äôd like to work in the non-profit or public sector? Perhaps you could be a freelancer or contractor? The possibilities are endless.</li>

<p>I‚Äôd especially like to thank industrial experience (IE) students who completed a year in industry as part of their degree as well as those who have done summer internships, either as part of the Master of Engineering (MEng) program or otherwise. In addition, the <a href="http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk">PASS leaders</a> and facilitators, <a href="https://unicsmcr.com/">UniCSmcr.com</a>, <a href="https://github.com/unicsmcr/hacksoc.com">HackSoc</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cssoc">CSSoc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Man-UP">Manchester Ultimate Programming</a> members have all been influential on the content of this book. I‚Äôve learned heaps by manually trawling through thousands of your CVs too, so if you‚Äôve shown me a copy of your CV, thanks! If you sent me a CV and I didn‚Äôt reply, I apologise. There are limits to what is humanly possible. The chapters on <a href="debugging.html">debugging your CV</a> (self assessment) and <a href="sampling.html">debugging their CV</a> (peer assessment) are based on the most common bugs (or are they features?)

<p>Many of the illustrations for this book have been drawn by the very talented Bryan Mathers <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanMMathers/">@BryanMMathers</a>. Bryan is an artist, visual thinker and entrepreneur, who also happens to have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Glasgow. His combined skills in art, science and engineering made him the perfect fit for illustrating this guidebook. You can find out more about Bryan at <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">bryanmathers.com</a> and <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">visualthinkery.com</a>. I‚Äôm <em>so</em> glad we randomly bumped into each other at a conference.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">0.6</span> About me<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#duncan"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/">Duncan Hull</a> and I wrote this guidebook for students at the University of Manchester where I‚Äôm a lecturer (‚âà <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_professor">Assistant Professor</a>) in the <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">Department of Computer Science</a>.</p>
<p>So what‚Äôs <em>my</em> story? Like many people, my path has been what <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenTupper">Helen Tupper</a> and Sarah Ellis call a ‚Äúsquiggly career‚Äù rather than classic linear one. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-squiggly" role="doc-biblioref">Tupper and Ellis 2020</a>)</span> I‚Äôve been gainfully employed as a paperboy, supermarket cashier, shelf stacker, sausage factory worker, pork pie filler, chef, dogsbody, field assistant, database administrator, deli counter server, consultant, matchday steward, juror, high school teacher, postdoc, research scientist, software engineer, lecturer, external examiner, tutor and academic.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve done a range of voluntary work too, serving as a competition judge, fundraiser, rabble rouser, <a href="https://codeclub.org">code club</a> &amp; <a href="https://coderdojo.com">coderdojo</a> leader, <a href="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/">digital council</a> member, <a href="https://governorsforschools.org.uk/">school governor</a>, curator, librarian, beer drinker, <a href="https://wiki-loves-scientists.org.uk/">wikipedia trainer</a>, <a href="https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">journal clubber</a> and editor. But as Ronnie Lane and Ronnie Wood once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger.‚Äù ‚ÄîRonnie Lane <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-faces" role="doc-biblioref">Lane and Wood 1979</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This guidebook documents some of what I know now, that I wish I‚Äôd known, when I was younger. If you‚Äôre starting your career, I hope you find these insights useful. I‚Äôve sat on both sides of the interview table, as interviewer and interviewee. I have had some spectacular failures, alongside some modest successes, and have included personal stories where they are relevant.</p>
<p>Most of what I have learned about employment comes from listening to, and watching students interact with employers as they take the first tentative steps in their careers. I‚Äôve documented some of what they taught me, so reading this book may help you learn from some of their successes and failures.</p>
