<p>A lot of careers advice can be dry, dull, textbooky, generic and boring with few illustrations and conversations. In the novel <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</a></em> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-wonderland">L. Carroll 1865</a>)</span> shown in figure <a href="https://www.cdyf.me#fig:aiw-fig">0.1</a>, the protagonist Alice wonders why her sister is reading a book without pictures.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:aiw-fig"></span>
<img src="images/alicequotation.jpeg" alt="Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?

<p>Pictures can tell stories, pictures can explain. Pictures can help you understand. Pictures can help you imagine. <a href="https://pythontutor.com/">Pictures can help you code</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-pythontutor">Guo 2013</a>)</span> So this book uses pictures (and conversations) to help you start coding your future.

<p>This guidebook will help you develop stronger habits of mind, body and soul using five key ingredients: <strong><code>C</code></strong>, <strong><code>D</code></strong>, <strong><code>Y</code></strong>, <strong><code>F</code></strong> and <strong><code>.me</code></strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong><code>C is for CODE</code></strong>: Instructions, algorithms, recipes, methods and strategies contained in this guidebook. This <code>code</code> is for your consumption, not for a machine.</li>
<li>
<strong><code>D is for DATA</code></strong>: From big data to microdata, from your data to my data and our data to metadata. From structured data, to semi-structured data and un-structured data. To factual, statistical, graphical, to readable, audible and watchable data. Data bytes, bits and bobs collected together for your analysis and amusement</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Y is for YOU</code></strong>: This book is all about you, with activities and other <em>coding challenges</em> for you to do in addition to just passively reading</li>
<li>
<strong><code>F is for FUTURES</code></strong>: Possible futures for you to think about. Try not to dwell on the past. Think about the future. Think about <em>your</em> future. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-thinkaboutthefuture">Ryder 1988</a>, <a href="reading.html#ref-wroteforluck">2019</a>)</span>

<p><em>Coding Your Future</em> explores techniques for investigating career possibilities, job searching, making career decisions, writing applications, doing interviews, negotiating job offers and operating successfully in the workplace.</p>
<p>Alongside these practical engineering issues, this guidebook also encourages you to <em>Design Your Future</em> by taking a step back and reflecting on the bigger picture. You will apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking">computational thinking</a> techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people about your experience, skills and knowledge. As there is a computational theme, you will also need to reflect on what your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output">inputs and outputs (I/O)</a> are, both now and in the future. You’ll also need to think about what recipes (or algorithms) you might start experimenting with</p>
<p>This guidebook investigates professional and pastoral issues in computing, for those with and without Computer Science degrees in the early stage of their careers.</p>
<!--We will also discuss some algorithms (recipes) that you might like to try-->

<span class="header-section-number">0.3</span> What you won’t learn<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#nilo"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This guidebook will NOT teach you how to write code, there’s already lots of fantastic resources to help you do that. We discuss some of them in chapter <a href="computing#computing">7</a> on <em>computing your future</em>.</p>

</h2>
<p>So what <em>will</em> you learn from this guidebook? After reading this guidebook, watching the videos and doing the exercises you will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Improve your self-awareness by describing who you are, what motivates you and your strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li>Experiment with using some job search strategies and make adjustments to your algorithms as necessary</li>
<li>Identify employers, sectors and roles that are of interest to you<br>
</li>
<li>Improve your written communication skills both for job applications and communicating with other people</li>
<li>Plan and prepare competitive written applications using standard techniques including CVs, covering letters, application forms and digital profiles</li>
<li>Compete confidently and successfully in interviews. Anticipate and prepare for both technical and non-technical questions</li>
<li>Plan further possibilities in your career such as promotion, postgraduate study &amp; research, alternative employment and longer term goals</li>
<li>Search and navigate a large “wordbase” (this guidebook and the work it cites). A wordbase is like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebase"><code>codebase</code></a>, only written predominantly in natural language.</li>
</ol>

<p>As the title of this guidebook implies, there is a computational flavour here, but you do not have to be studying Computer Science to benefit. There are two main target audiences for this guidebook:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of their degree. This includes software engineering, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction (HCI), information systems, health informatics, data science, gaming, cybersecurity and all the other myriad flavours of Computer Science</li>
<li>Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying <em>any</em> subject, with little or no Computer Science at all. You are curious to know about what role computing could play in your future career because computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists, see chapter <a href="computing#computing">7</a> on <em>Computing your Future</em>
</li>
<li>Unless you are a mature student, you are most probably a member of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">Generation Z</a>

<p>So the prerequisites for this book are that you are studying (or have studied) at a University where English is one of the main spoken languages. You <em>may</em> have some experience already, either casual, voluntary or otherwise, but this book does <strong>not</strong> assume that you have already been employed in some capacity.</p>

<p>Instead of reading this book, I suggest you follow the advice given to historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodruff">William Woodruff</a> about reading books when he was at University:</p>
<blockquote>
“You don’t READ books, you GUT them!”
<footer>
— William Woodruff <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-nabend">Woodruff 2003</a>)</span>
</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>So, gut this book like the fish in figure <a href="https://www.cdyf.me#fig:gut-fig">0.3</a>. Identify the chapters that are most useful to you (the flesh), and skip the rest (the guts). Which chapters are flesh and which are guts will depend on what stage of the journey you are at. This guidebook is designed to be as “guttable” as possible. To aid gutting, the version published at <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/">cdyf.me</a> has a built in search and tables of contents. Before you can gut the fish, you’ll need an anatomical map shown in figure <a href="https://www.cdyf.me#fig:map-fig">0.4</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>The first six chapters of this guidebook look at what engineers call <em>design</em>. When you build anything, a bridge, a piece of software, a car or a plane you’ll need to do some design like the blueprint in figure <a href="https://www.cdyf.me#fig:brooklyn-fig">0.5</a></p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p>Building a career isn’t that different to building anything else, you’ll need do many iterations of designing, coding, testing, building and deploying. Designing things often involves answering tricky questions. So when you’re designing your future you’ll need to cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter <a href="rebooting#rebooting">1</a>: <em>Rebooting Your Future</em> discusses why you should bother reading this guidebook and coding your future</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="exploring#exploring">2</a>: <em>Exploring Your Future</em> challenges you to reflect on who you are, what makes you unique and what you have to offer to build better self-awareness</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="nurturing#nurturing">3</a>: <em>Nurturing Your Future</em> looks at ways you to be more concious of, and improve, both your mental and physical health</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="writing#writing">4</a>: <em>Writing Your Future</em> explores your softer communication skills, how they complement your hard skills and why employers value them so much</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="experiencing#experiencing">5</a>: <em>Experiencing Your Future</em> asks you to reflect on your experience and help identify where you can improve it</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="choosing#choosing">6</a>: <em>Choosing Your Future</em> encourages you to broaden your computational horizons. What possibile routes can you choose from, beyond the obvious well-trodden paths?</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="computing#computing">7</a>: <em>Computing Your Future</em> looks at the role computing can play in your career, especially if Computer Science is not a major part of your degree</li>

<span class="header-section-number">0.5.2</span> Testing Your Future<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#part"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The next seven chapters look at testing your future, by taking a test-driven approach to career development. What tests do you need to prepare for and pass before you can starting building your future? Just like building high quality software requires that you pass tests, so too, building a career means passing a series of tests. Each of these tests have inputs, an algorithm and outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter <a href="debugging#debugging">8</a>: <em>Debugging Your Future</em> looks at debugging your own written communication such as CVs, résumés, covering letters, application forms and digital portfolios.</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="hacking#hacking">9</a>: <em>Hacking Your Future</em> invites you to put yourself in the employers shoes by debugging and hacking other people’s CVs</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="verbalising#verbalising">10</a>: <em>Verbalising Your Future</em> gets you to debug your CV by reflecting on your actions and their impact by articulating them using carefully chosen verbs on your job applications</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="finding#finding">11</a>: <em>Finding Your Future</em> looks at where and how can you look for interesting opportunities</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="moving#moving">12</a>: <em>Moving Your Future</em> investigates three of the most important criteria of your job search: location, location, location.</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="speaking#speaking">13</a>: <em>Speaking Your Future</em> looks how can you turn interviews to your advantage and negotiate any offers you receive</li>
<li>Chapter <a href="questioning#questioning">14</a>: <em>Questioning Your Future</em> is based on Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) by undergraduate students. What questions to people most commonly ask about getting a job?</li>

<p>The next chapters look at building your future. You’ve passed all the tests, what do do you need to do to keep building your future in the same way as you would build a bridge, like the one shown in figure <a href="https://www.cdyf.me#fig:manhattan-fig">0.6</a>.</p>

<p>I’m looking for feedback and contributions on everything in this guidebook from the small things like typos, grammatical errors and spelling mistakes through to bigger issues for each chapter such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the chapter make sense? How could concepts be made more clear?</li>
<li>Does it strike the right tone, is it pitched at the right level? Not patronising? Too many platitudes?</li>
<li>Are there too many motivational (or <a href="https://despair.com/collections/demotivators">demotivational</a>) quotations?</li>
<li>Where is it too long and waffly (see figure <a href="debugging#fig:shorterletter-fig">8.22</a>) or too short?</li>
<li>Are there too many (or too few) pictures? What needs more illustration?</li>
<li>Is it well scoped? Too broad or too narrow?</li>
<li>Are the stated learning objectives met by the chapter?</li>
<li>Are the activities clear? Can students understand why the activities are recommended? What other activities could be added?</li>
<li>Will it make sense to global readers e.g. will students from America, China and India etc understand the quirks and idioms of English language and culture</li>
<li>Are there too many metaphors? Mixed metaphors? Awkward analogies? Idiotic idioms? Annoying alliterations?</li>
<li>Too many citations? Not enough citations? Missed any key citations?</li>
<li>What else is missing?</li>
<li>Where are the unstated assumptions? Where is the unconscious bias?</li>
<li>What are the issues with equality, diversity and inclusion?</li>
<li>Are there too many musical references or annoying emoji? Please bear in mind I’m trying to be irreverent, light-hearted, not-very-corporate but definitely playful to improve readability 😜</li>
<li>What else needs to be ruthlessly edited out?</li>

<p>Hello, my name is <a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/">Duncan Hull</a> and I’m currently writing this guidebook for undergraduate and postgraduate students as part of my day job at the University of Manchester where I’m a Senior Lecturer (≈ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_professor">Associate Professor</a>) in the <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">Department of Computer Science</a>.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Coding Your Future is currently a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This is the software engineering way of saying “it isn’t finished yet”&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>So what’s <em>my</em> story? I’ve been gainfully employed as a paperboy, supermarket cashier, shelf stacker, sausage packer, computer hacker, pork pie filler, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plongeur">plongeur</a>, chef, dogsbody, field assistant, database administrator, deli counter server, consultant, matchday steward, envelope stuffer, high school teacher, postdoc, research scientist, chairperson, software engineer, lecturer, external examiner, tutor and scholar. Like many people, my path has been a bit of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey">Odyssey</a> or what Helen Tupper and Sarah Ellis call a “<a href="https://www.amazingif.com/books/">squiggly career</a>”. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-squigglybook">Tupper and Ellis 2020</a>)</span> It’s highly likely that your career will not follow a neat linear trajectory either, also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_career">portfolio career</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-squigglytalk">Tupper and Ellis 2021</a>; <a href="reading.html#ref-odyssey">Homer 800BC</a>)</span></p>
<p>Beyond the paid stuff, I’ve done a range of voluntary work too, serving as a competition judge, fundraiser, <a href="https://codeclub.org">code club</a> &amp; <a href="https://coderdojo.com">coderdojo</a> leader, rabble rouser, <a href="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/">digital council</a> member, <a href="https://governorsforschools.org.uk/">school governor</a>, curator, librarian, beer drinker, itinerant blogger, <a href="https://wiki-loves-scientists.org.uk/">wikipedia trainer</a>, <a href="https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">journal clubber</a> and editor.

<p>This guidebook documents some of what I know now, that I wish I’d known, when I was younger. If you’re starting your career, I hope you find these insights and exercises useful. I’ve sat on both sides of many interview tables, as interviewer and interviewee. I have had some spectacular failures, alongside some modest successes, and have included personal stories where they are relevant.</p>
<p>Most of what I have learned about employment comes from listening to, watching and helping students as they interact with employers on the first tentative moves in their careers, particularly through our industrial experience program, see figure <a href="https://www.cdyf.me#fig:ie-fig">0.17</a>.</p>
