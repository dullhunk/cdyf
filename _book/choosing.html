<p>Your future is full of exciting new possibilities, but which of these options will you choose? What are all the opportunities for students of computing? How will you choose <em>the one</em> is best for <em>you</em>? When choosing your future, do you see yourself as a <code>default user</code> or the <code>weird edge case</code> pictured in figure <a href="choosing#fig:default-user-fig">6.1</a>?</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p>Perhaps you’re a weird edge case. Perhaps typical graduate destinations such as large multi-national corporations, do not really make you want to <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_Your_Thang">Shake Your Thang</a></em>? <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-saltnpepa">Isley, Isley, and Isley 1988</a>)</span> Perhaps you are more interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>working in computing in roles beyond software engineering?</li>
<li>using your technical skills more responsibly and ethically to make the world a better place?</li>
<li>starting your own business and making money for yourself, rather than other people?</li>
<li>finding <em>hidden</em> or unadvertised vacancies?</li>
<li>joining or founding a startup or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaleup_company">Scale-up company</a> instead of a large multinational corporation?</li>
<li>venturing outside of the private sector?</li>
</ul>
<p>Broadening your initial job search described in chapter <a href="finding#finding">11</a> will open up more opportunities on your horizon. This chapter will broaden those horizons and get you to think about some of the less obvious options you can choose from.</p>
<p>Many technology jobs exist outside of technology companies, <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-outsideit">Asay 2020</a>)</span> because a lot of software is written to be <em>used</em> rather than sold. Consequently, many employers create bespoke software to fit the needs of their business. The people who build it are often employees, rather than people employed by a technology company. In the United States for example, ninety percent of IT jobs are outside the traditional tech industry. Technical jobs outside the technology sector often have the advantage of being more accessible than those within a very competitive technology sector. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-burninglass">Markow, Coutinho, and Bundy 2019</a>)</span></p>
<p>Your future is bright, your future needs choosing, so let’s start choosing your future.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Vocational or academic?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#vocation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Some undergraduate degrees like medicine, dentistry and nursing are highly vocational. Other degrees have a stronger academic flavour. According to some studies, vocational degrees can be the best route to highly skilled jobs. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-vocational">Adams 2018</a>)</span> Computer Science degrees often develop highly vocational skills and knowledge, through disciplines like software engineering for example. They often contain more theoretical, scientific and academic topics like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation">theory of computation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability">probability theory</a> too.</p>
<p>What is the blend of vocational vs. academic study in your degree? It’s good to have a mixture of theory and practice, see figure <a href="choosing#fig:ometer-fig">6.2</a>, because employers value both of them. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-vocational">Adams 2018</a>)</span> However, unless you’re considering a career in research or academia (see chapter <a href="researching#researching">16</a>) it’s probably the <em>vocational</em> part of your degree that will give you the clearest initial direction into paid employment.</p>

<p>There are plenty of roles in computing working in research, either in computer science, or working alongside natural scientists, such as physicists at <a href="https://home.cern/">home.cern</a> or laboratory scientists working at the bench. For example, there are <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-01516-2">lots roles in research software engineering</a> (RSE), using code to facilitate better scientific research, see the <em>Society of Research Software Engineering</em>: <a href="https://society-rse.org/">society-rse.org</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-rses">Woolston 2022</a>; <a href="reading#ref-researchit">Bell 2023</a>)</span></p>

<p>These are mainly UK opportunities, but it is a similar story around the world. Many Universities and research institutes have summer internships for computer science students working alongside researchers. For example, at the University of Manchester, summer vacancies tend to be advertised each year around April/May. Wherever you are, speak to the head of a research lab you’re interested in. Ask them if they have plans to take on summer students.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> Freelancing and contract<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#freelancing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It is very common for organisations to employ software engineers and other technical staff as contractors, for fixed periods of time (weeks or months), rather than as permanent employees (typically years). Consequently, there is lots of work available in freelance and contract work. The sites below could help you bid for work available as a self-employed contractor and freelancer</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.toptal.com/">toptal.com</a> You need to interview to get invited to join the network</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.upwork.com/">upwork.com</a> Can be quite heavy on fees but lots of leads</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.freelancer.co.uk/">freelancer.co.uk</a> A lot of international competition, but still plenty of work</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">fiverr.com</a> another marketplace for freelancers</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to getting contract and freelance work via these websites is to get good reviews. You could start out by offering low prices and bidding on smaller projects to get a good reputation before starting to focus on larger, higher paid projects. Beware that if you are going to use the sites above you’ll be paid a low rate as you’ll be competing with freelancers in countries with much lower costs of living. Having said that, any freelance or contract work will look good on your CV if you’re competing with students who have no paid experience at all, not even casual work. Some pros and cons of freelancing are shown in the table below.</p>

<p>To find projects where you can work directly with the client (without going through a broker or agent), a good place to start is attending local meetups. Organisations like technw.uk, meetup.com and eventbrite.co.uk etc are all good places to start looking.</p>
<p>Other good leads are friends and family, can you develop software or hardware that solves a problem that your friends or family have? You could charge them “mates rates”, to get your business off the ground.</p>

<p>Since there’s so much power and money tied up in computing, do computer scientists need to sell their soul to the highest or most powerful bidder for their services?

<p>So when you’re searching for jobs and researching potential employers, one of the first things you need to find out is what the values and ethical principles of an employer are, see section <a href="finding#beware">11.4</a>. This is a quick way to evaluate what makes an organisation who they are. Most employers publish their values and ethics openly, here’s a small selection to give you a flavour:</p>

<p>Let’s look at Morgan Stanley (figure <a href="choosing#fig:morgan-stanley-fig">6.10</a>) as an example, I’ve chosen these values because they are brief and self-explanatory. Morgan Stanley’s values are to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do the right thing: act with integrity</li>
<li>Put clients first: listen to what the client is saying and needs</li>
<li>Lead with exceptional ideas: win by breaking new ground</li>
<li>Commit to Diversity and Inclusion: value individual and cultural differences</li>
<li>Give back: serve communities generously with expertise, time and money</li>
</ol>
<p>Look at these values carefully, or choose the values of another employer you’re interested in. What do they mean to you?</p>
<p>Do an employers words match their actions? The words <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">Don’t be evil</a></strong> are easy to <em>say</em> but harder to <em>action</em>. Good intentions are often easier said than done.</p>
<p>So back to our original question, do you have to sell your soul?</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t have to sell your soul <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-iwannabeadored">I. Brown and Squire 1989</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>It depends what’s in your soul anyway</li>

<li>How can computing make a difference?</li>
<li>How can <strong>YOU</strong> use Computer Science to make the world a better place?</li>

<p>Let’s pause here. Insert a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint">breakpoint</a> in your <code>code</code> and slowly step through it so we can examine the current values of your variables and parameters.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="choosing#cb11-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>PAUSE ⏸️</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>How closely do a given employers values align with your own? You may need to revisit section <a href="exploring#no42">2.2.4</a>.
<ul>
<li>You might not get a 100% match but you’re unlikely to enjoy working for an employer where your values don’t match very well at all</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are the stated values of an employer the whole story?
<ul>
<li>Are there any unwritten or unspoken rules?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there anything missing?</li>
<li>How much do an employers actions match their words? What an employer <em>says</em> and <em>does</em> may be contradictory. Actions speak louder than words</li>
<li>What can computing do to tackle global challenges described in section <a href="choosing#betterplace">6.6</a>

<p>Once you’ve thought about these questions, you stand a much better chance of working out if a given employer is a good match for you. So do you have to sell your soul as shown in figure <a href="choosing#fig:soul-fig">6.13</a>? It depends on what you value and if an employer shares those values with you.</p>

<p>Your future is bright, your future needs choosing. Choosing your future will help you design your future. Designing your future will help you to start coding your future.</p>
<p>This chapter has looked at the choices and options available to you as a student of computing. Each of these choices are starting points, <em>directions</em> rather than <em>destinations</em>, so you don’t need to get too hung up worrying if they are the right choice for you in the longer term. As Bill Gates puts it, <em>your life isn’t a one-act play</em>, see figure <a href="choosing#fig:one-act-fig">6.14</a>.</p>

<p>In the next part of this guidebook, chapter <a href="computing#computing">7</a>: <em>Computing your Future</em> we’ll take a broader look at why computing is a subject for everyone, not just Computer Scientists.</p>
<p>If you’re studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of your degree, you can probably skip this chapter which is aimed at a more general audience and go straight to chapter <a href="debugging#debugging">8</a>: <em>Debugging your Future</em> which will help you identify and fix bugs in your written job applications.</p>
