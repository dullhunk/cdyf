<p>Do you feel like the <em>weird edge case</em> pictured in Figure <a href="broadening.html#fig:default-user-fig">9.1</a>? Do typical graduate destinations such as large multi-national corporations, not really make you want to <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_Your_Thang">Shake Your Thang</a></em>? <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-saltnpepa" role="doc-biblioref">Isley, Isley, and Isley 1988</a>)</span> Perhaps you want to:</p>

<li>use your technical skills responsibly and ethically to make the world a better place?</li>
<li>start your own business and make money for yourself, rather than other people?</li>
<li>work in computing in roles outside of classic software engineering?</li>
</ul>
<p>Broadening your initial job search described in chapter <a href="finding.html#finding">8</a> will open up more opportunities on your horizon. This chapter will broaden those horizons and get you to think about some of the less obvious options, because I <em>love</em> weird edge cases and you should too. 😻</p>

<p>Many technology jobs exist outside of technology companies, <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-outsideit" role="doc-biblioref">Assay 2020</a>)</span> because a lot of software is written to be used rather than sold. Consequently, many employers create bespoke software to fit their own business needs. The people who build it are often employees that given organisation, rather than people employed by a technology company. In the United States for example, ninety percent of IT jobs are outside the traditional tech industry. Technical jobs outside the technology sector often have the advantage of being more accessible than those within a very competitive technology sector. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-burninglass" role="doc-biblioref">Markow, Coutinho, and Bundy 2019</a>)</span></p>

Computer programs deeply transform science. Beyond every recent scientific discovery there is digital data and programs to analyze, store, make sense of reality through computers. NumPY is one such computer program that has been developed over the last decade, becoming an essential instrument for key discoveries in astronomy, chemistry or biology.

<p>Given the growing power of computing in the twenty-first century, computer scientists have a duty to society to use that power responsibly and justly. How can they do so? Do computer scientists need to sell their soul to the highest bidder?</p>

<p>So when you’re searching for jobs and researching potential employers, one of the first things you need to find out is what the values and ethical principles of an employer are see section <a href="finding.html#beware">8.3</a>. It’s a quick way to evaluate what makes an organisation who they are. Most employers publish their values and ethics openly, here’s a small selection to give you a flavour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles">amazon.jobs/en/principles</a>
</li>
<li>Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-values">microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-values</a>
</li>
<li>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/compliance/">apple.com/compliance</a>
</li>
<li>Google <a href="https://ai.google/principles/">ai.google/principles</a>
</li>
<li>Morgan Stanley <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us/morgan-stanley-core-values">morganstanley.com/about-us/morgan-stanley-core-values</a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span id="fig:morgan-stanley-fig"></span>
<img src="images/morgan-stanley-times-square.jpeg" alt="Morgan Stanley is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered in New York City.

</p>
</div>

<p>Let’s look at Morgan Stanley (figure <a href="broadening.html#fig:morgan-stanley-fig">9.4</a>) as an example, I’ve chosen these values because they are brief and self-explanatory:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do the right thing: act with integrity</li>
<li>Put clients first: listen to what the client is saying and needs</li>
<li>Lead with exceptional ideas: win by breaking new ground</li>
<li>Commit to Diversity &amp; Inclusion: value individual and cultural differences</li>
<li>Give back: serve communities generously with expertise, time and money</li>
</ol>
<p>Look at these values carefully, or choose the values of another employer you’re interested in. What do they mean to you?</p>
</div>
<div id="bp9" class="section level2" number="9.4">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Breakpoints<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bp9"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Let’s pause here. Insert a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint">breakpoint</a> in your <code>code</code> and slowly step through it so we can examine the values of your variables and parameters.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb30-1"><a href="broadening.html#cb30-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>PAUSE ⏸️</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>How closely do a given employers values align with your own? You may need to revisit section <a href="knowing.html#no42">2.3</a>.
<ul>
<li>You might not get a 100% match but you’re unlikely to enjoy working for an employer where your values don’t match very well at all</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are the stated values of an employer the whole story?</li>
<li>Is there anything missing?</li>
<li>Are there any unwritten rules? What an employers <em>says</em> and <em>does</em> may be contradictory. Actions speak louder than words.</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb31"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb31-1"><a href="broadening.html#cb31-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>RESUME ▶️</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once you’ve thought about these questions, you stand a much better chance of working out if a given employer is a good match for you. So do you have to sell your soul as shown in figure <a href="broadening.html#fig:soul-fig">9.5</a>? It depends on what you value and if an employer shares those values with you.</p>

* Teaching: coding their future

The computer scientist [Simon Peyton Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Peyton_Jones) explains why teachers of computing are crucial from primary school through to secondary school and beyond. Can you inspire the next generation with your knowledge of computing? ,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwV3QyVc-go

Teaching is not a delivery system, it's an art form.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/ken-robinson-teaching.png" alt="(ref:captionkenrob)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:teach-fig)(ref:captionkenrob)</p>
</div>

(ref:captionkenrob) According to [Ken Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Robinson_(educationalist)), teaching is an art form. [@kills1; @kills2] Are you an artist? There is significant demand for artists like you who can teach computing to the next generation. You don't even need to have studied Computer Science to become a teacher of computing.
