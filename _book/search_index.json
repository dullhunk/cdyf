This guidebook is aimed at students in higher education, both those studying Computer Science as part of their degree or those from other disciplines with an interest in computing. This guidebook supports second year teaching at the University of Manchester, but it DOES NOT MATTER: what stage of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year what level you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate what subject you are studying, provided that you are computationally curious what institution you are studying at, this book is University and institution agnostic where in the world you are studying So there is probably something in this guidebook for every student of computing around the world. üåéüåçüåè 0.1 Visualising your future A lot of literature about what comes after University can be dry, dull, textbook-y and boring with few illustrations and conversations. Figure 0.1: The cover of the 1898 edition of the novel Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland. Public domain image via Wikimedia Commons w.wiki/327E In the novel Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland (Caroll 1865), the heroine Alice is looking at book her sister is reading: Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‚Äúand what is the use of a book,‚Äù thought Alice ‚Äúwithout pictures or conversations?‚Äù ‚Äì See gutenberg.org (Caroll 1865) So this book uses pictures and conversations wherever possible to help you understand and visualise your future. 0.2 Your future aims This guidebook aims to help you develop stronger habits of mind, body and soul using five key ingredients: Code: Instructions contained in this guidebook Data: Facts, statistics and images collected together for your analysis You: Activities for you to do in addition to reading Futures: Possible futures for you to think about. Try not to dwell on the past. Think about the future. (Ryder 1988, 2019) Me: Hello, my name is Duncan. I‚Äôm your tour guide here. If you‚Äôre feeling a bit lost, follow me. Figure 0.2: Hello my name is Duncan. If you‚Äôre feeling a bit lost, follow me. Image adapted from ‚ÄúHello my name is sticker‚Äù by Eviatar Bach, public domain w.wiki/32RV Coding your future explores techniques for making career decisions, job searching, submitting applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace. Alongside these practical engineering issues, this guidebook also encourages you to design your future by taking a step back and reflecting on the bigger picture. You will apply computational thinking techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people and what your experience is. As there is a computational theme, you will also need to reflect on what your inputs and outputs (I/O) are, both now and in the future. You‚Äôll also need to think about what recipes (or algorithms) you might start experimenting with This guidebook tackles professional issues in computing, for those with and without Computer Science degrees in the early stage of their careers. 0.3 What you won‚Äôt learn What you won‚Äôt learn This guidebook will NOT teach you how to write code, there‚Äôs already lots of fantastic resources to help you do that. We discuss some of them in chapter on computing your future. 0.4 Learning your future So what will you learn from this guidebook? After reading this guidebook, watching the videos and doing the exercises you will be able to: Improve your self-awareness by describing who you are, what motivates you and your strengths and weaknesses Decide on a job search strategy and identify employers, sectors and roles that are of interest to you Improve your written communication skills both for job applications and communicating with other people Plan and prepare competitive written applications using standard techniques including CVs, covering letters, application forms and digital profiles Compete successfully in interviews and assessment centres by preparing for technical and non-technical questions Plan further steps in your career such as promotion, postgraduate study &amp; research, alternative employment and longer term goals Search and navigate a large ‚Äúwordbase‚Äù (this guidebook and the work it cites). A wordbase is like a codebase, only written predominantly in natural language. 0.4.1 Your future prerequisites As the title of this guidebook implies, there is a computational flavour here, but you do not have to be studying Computer Science to benefit. There are two main target audiences for this guidebook: Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of their degree. This includes software engineering, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction (HCI), information systems, health informatics, data science, gaming, cybersecurity and all the other myriad flavours of Computer Science Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying any subject, with little or no Computer Science at all. You are curious to know about what role computing could play in your future career because computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists. So the prerequisites for this book are that you are studying (or have studied) at University where English is one of the main spoken languages. You may have some experience already, either casual, voluntary or otherwise, but this book does not assume that you have already been employed in some capacity. 0.4.2 Gutting your future Don‚Äôt read this book, gut it! Reading this book from cover to cover like a novel is not recommended. That would be foolish. Figure 0.3: Don‚Äôt read this book, gut it like a fish. Gutting fish in Isla Margarita image by Wilfredor via Wikimedia commons w.wiki/_23m Instead of reading this book, I suggest you follow the advice given to historian William Woodruff about reading books when he was at University: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt READ books, you GUT them!‚Äù (Woodruff 2003) üêü So, gut this book like a fish. Identify the chapters that are most useful to you (the flesh), and skip the rest (the guts). Which chapters are flesh and which are guts will depend on what stage of the journey you are at. This guidebook is designed to be as ‚Äúguttable‚Äù as possible. To aid gutting, the version published at cdyf.me has a built in search and tables of contents. Before you can gut the fish, you‚Äôll need an anatomical map shown in figure 0.4. 0.5 Mapping your future This guidebook is split into three parts. The first part is on designing your future while the second is on building and testing your future shown in the map in figure 0.4. The final part is a help section, for rebooting your future. Let‚Äôs look in a bit more detail at the content of each of the three parts of this guidebook: Figure 0.4: Mapping your future: Each yellow dot on this diagram is a chapter in Coding Your Future. The chapters on the left tackle design issues like who are you? Chapters on the right tackle the practicalities of executing and testing your career choices, such as debugging your CV. Mapping your Future artwork by Visual Thinkery is licenced under CC-BY-ND 0.5.1 Designing your future The first six chapters of this guidebook look at what engineers call design. When you build anything, a bridge, a piece of software, a car or a plane you‚Äôll need to do some design like the blueprint in figure 0.5 Figure 0.5: Designing your future is about drawing up a blueprint, like this one for the elevation of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York. What does your blueprint look like? The chapters on designing your future will help you fill in the details. Building a career isn‚Äôt that different to building anything else, you‚Äôll need to do some design work and it will probably be iterative. Designing things often involves asking tricky questions. So when you‚Äôre designing your future you‚Äôll need to cover the following: Bothering with your future looks at why you should bother reading any of this book Knowing your future challenges you to reflect on who you are, what makes you unique and why you are here Looking after your future encourages you to take care of your mental and physical health Writing your future explores your soft skills, and how they complement your hard skills and why employers value them so much Experiencing your future asks you to reflect on your work experience and help identify where you can improve it Computing your future looks at the role computing can play in your career, with or without a Computer Science degree 0.5.2 Building and testing your future The next six chapters look at building and testing your future, what engineers like to call implementation, execution or construction shown in figure 0.6 Figure 0.6: Just like the Manhattan Bridge, your future will be easier to build once you‚Äôve done some design. Even a sketch will do. Design questions are covered in the first part of this guidebook: designing your future. Picture of the Manhattan bridge under construction in 1909 adapted from a public domain image via Wikimedia commons w.wiki/32Rg Once you‚Äôve started to answer the design questions in the first part, you can start to implement (or build) your career and think about what the next steps will be. Debugging your future looks at debugging your written communication such as covering letters, application forms and digital portfolios. Finding your future, looks at where and how can you look for interesting opportunities Speaking your future, looks how can you turn interviews to your advantage and negotiate any offers you receive Surviving your future looks at the next steps. Once you‚Äôve landed a job, how will you survive and thrive outside (and after) University Researching your future discusses if a Masters degree or a PhD right for you? Broadening your future encourages you to broaden your horizons. Maybe you want to start your own business and employ others or you‚Äôd like to work in the non-profit or public sector? Perhaps you could be a freelancer or contractor? The possibilities are endless. 0.5.3 Supporting your future The third part of this book, contains supporting material that will help the design, build and test phases described above. You‚Äôll need good support to help with the stresses and strains of building your future shown in 0.7 Figure 0.7: The Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol has supporting chains which can move when heavy loads pass over the Avon valley bridge. You‚Äôll need good support to cope with the stresses and strains of building your future. Clifton suspension bridge picture adapted from original by Nic Trott via Wikimedia commons w.wiki/32tu Ruling your future provides Ten Simple Rules for Coding your Future, this book in a nutshell Reading their future invites you to put yourself in the employers shoes by reading some CVs Moving your future looks at opportunities outside of capital cities like London Listening to your future invites you to hear students stories of their transition from education to employment Actioning your future gets you to think about your actions by emphasising verbs on your job applications Scheduling your future invites you to set aside an hour each week for tackling the issues described in this book Reading your future everything we‚Äôve cited in this guidebook, because books are good for your soul 0.6 Your future themes This guidebook aims to help you build a bridge from where you are now to where you‚Äôd like to be in the future. Each chapter of the book contains the following recurring themes: Figure 0.8: The iconic Golden Gate Bridge in California, adapted from an original picture by Frank Schulenburg (CC BY-SA) on Wikimedia Commons w.wiki/37kY Learning your future: What you will learn from any given chapter Watching your future: videos and animations for you to watch Listening to your future: audio and podcasts for you to listen to Speaking your future: articulating from a script or by improvisation Discussing your future: breakpoints invite you to stop your code from executing and think about the variables and parameters you are using. Can they be improved? Reflect and discuss. Reading your future: reading stuff because its good for your mind, body and soul Writing your future: written exercises using natural language Quizzing your future: quick quizzes to be done in real-time live scheduled sessions (synchronously) and in your own time (asynchronously) Assessing your future: activities to be assessed by yourself, your peers, an employer or an academic (depending on who and where you are) Challenging your future: coding challenges are designed to take you out of your comfort zone by encouraging you to experiment with your thoughts, discussions and actions Signposting your future: the most useful resources that I recommend you read, listen to or watch 0.7 Acknowledgements The content of this book is based on hundreds of conversations I have had with students of (mainly) Computer Science and Maths with some Physics and Engineering, since 2012. I‚Äôve also spoken to many of their employers too. 0.7.1 Standing on the shoulders of students First and foremost, I‚Äôd like to thank all the students who have helped with this book, both directly and indirectly. ‚ÄúIf I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of students.‚Äù (Newton 1675) So, if you have studied some flavour of Computer Science at the University of Manchester since 2012, there‚Äôs a high probability you have contributed to this book. Thank you for having the courage to tell me your stories. Thank you for being ambitious, hard working, talented, fearless, creative, inspirational and listening to me. It has been my pleasure and privilege to work with you all. Figure 0.9: Posing on the BBC Breakfast red sofa with the winning student team at the BBC / Barclays University Technology Challenge (UTC) in MediaCityUK, Salford, Greater Manchester I‚Äôd especially like to thank industrial experience (IE) students who have completed a year in industry as part of their degree as well as those who have done summer internships, either as part of the Master of Engineering (MEng) program or otherwise, particularly Luke Beamish and Petia Davidova. In addition, the PASS leaders and facilitators, UniCSmcr.com, HackSoc, CSSoc and Manchester Ultimate Programming members have all been influential on the content of this book. I‚Äôve learned heaps by manually trawling through thousands of your CVs too, so if you‚Äôve shown me a copy of your CV, thanks! If you sent me a CV and I didn‚Äôt reply, I apologise. There are limits to what is humanly possible. The chapters on debugging your future (self assessment) and reading their future (peer assessment) are based on the most common bugs (or are they features?) I‚Äôve seen in CVs. So, thank you students for being studious. üôè 0.7.2 Thanks to employers Thanks to all the organisations who have employed students from the Department of Computer Science as either summer interns, year long placements or graduates. A big chunk of this guidebook documents their experience of employers and their graduate recruitment programs. Thanks to Niall Beard and Sharif Salah at Google for introducing me to Google‚Äôs Technical Writing course. (Googler 2019) So, thanks employers for employing our students. üôè 0.7.3 Thanks to colleagues I‚Äôve also had significant support from colleagues in the Department of Computer Science (@csmcr) and support staff at the University of Manchester. (@ManUniCareers, @alumniUoM, @OfficialUoM) I would especially like to thank Jim Miles for encouraging me to write a book shortly after he offered me a job. I thought he was joking (about the book) but it actually turned out to be another one of Jim‚Äôs great ideas. Thanks Jim. üôè I‚Äôd also like to thank the only three people in the whole world who‚Äôve had the misfortune of reading all of my PhD thesis; Robert Stevens, Anil Wipat and Steve Pettifer. I suspect it was as painful for you to read as it was for me to write it. Thanks Robert for your relentless patience and giving me a well timed, well aimed kick up the arse (to write this book) in the Midland Hotel, Manchester at the May ball. Ô∏è Thanks to Carole Goble for re-teaching me how to write by covering drafts of my MSc thesis in red ink (and swear words 1) and Steve Furber for playing bass in our ‚Äúboy band‚Äù Tuning Complete. 0.7.3.1 Thanks to academic staff Thanks to past and present academic colleagues, PhD students and teachers at the University of Manchester who have contributed to this guidebook and the environment it was written in.

Optimists will tell you that ‚Äúeveryone has a book in them‚Ä¶,‚Äù but pessimists like Christopher Hitchens will add that ‚Äú‚Ä¶in most cases that‚Äôs exactly where it should remain.‚Äù (Hitchens 1997) Despite Hitchens amusing trademark cynicism shown in figure 0.10, I am an optimist when it comes to the power of natural languages. Figure 0.10: Christopher Hitchens explains the difference between autobiography and memoir (Hitchens 1997) 0.7.3.2 Thanks to professional services staff Thanks also to the superb support staff (past and present) from professional services, especially the Academic Support Office (ACSO), Student Support Office (SSO) and external affairs office in the Kilburn building.

(Scott 1974) üçû 0.7.7 Thank you Swindon Thanks to headteacher Clive Zimmerman, his team of staff, Mr M. Carter , Mr K. Thomas and the students of Greendown Community School (now Lydiard Park Academy) in Swindon, Wiltshire for hosting my second PGCE teaching placement. It was fun teaching you about waves using Alom Shaha‚Äôs jelly babies and kebab sticks shown in figure 0.13. Figure 0.13: A wave machine demonstration by Alom Shaha with Physics and jelly babies. What‚Äôs not to like? (Shaha 2014) So thanks Swindon for being great and western and Swindon Town Football Club, the best football team in the whole of Wiltshire . üôè 0.7.8 Thank you schools Thanks to all the schools who interviewed (but rejected me) for my Newly Qualified Teacher (NQT) year. Doing interview lessons, meeting your students and your senior leadership teams was a gruelling but fascinating magical mystery tour of the UK education system, both public and private. Although unsuccessful, these interviews were very productive failures: Wrightlington School, Radstock, Somerset, see their amazing Orchid project wsbeorchids.org run by Simon Pugh-Jones The Cooper School, Bicester, Oxfordshire, see their teacher in my pocket project St John‚Äôs Marlborough, Wiltshire - not to be confused its posher and more famous next door neighbour Marlborough College Oasis Academy, Brislington, Bristol Redland Green School, Redland, Bristol The John of Gaunt School, Trowbridge, Wiltshire Didcot Girls‚Äô School, Didcot, Oxfordshire Cheltenham Ladies‚Äô College, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire2 Blackburn College, Lancashire ‚ÄúI read the news today, oh boy! Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire‚Äù (Lennon and McCartney 1967) So thanks schools, for schooling. üôè 0.7.9 Thank you Stockport Thanks to headteacher Joanne Meredith, her team of staff and the students at St. Annes R.C. High School, Stockport for hosting my Newly Qualified Teacher (NQT) year. Thanks to Keith Doran and other members of the alternative staff room for your emotional, moral and practical support throughout the year. According to the Manchester Evening News, St. Anne‚Äôs is ‚Äúthe forgotten school‚Äù (Johnson 2020; Gill and Statham 2021), see figure 0.14, but I‚Äôll never forget you or the lessons you taught me. Figure 0.14: Good governance is crucial to good schools. Many schools like St. Anne‚Äôs, and the hundreds of children they educate every year, need help from skilled people like you on their governing boards. Why not serve your local community as a ‚Äúcritical friend‚Äù on the governing board of a school? Take a look at governorsforschools.org.uk. Fair use image via Wikimedia Commons w.wiki/33Xs made with the Wikipedia app So thanks Stockport for being Stockport, the magnificent Stockport Viaduct and for The Hatters! It‚Äôs all that matters, Stockport Hatters. üôè 0.7.10 Thank you Moravians Thanks to Thsespal Kundan, Principal of the Moravian Institute in Rajpur, Dehradun, Uttar Pradesh, India for hosting me and my friend Doug fresh out of high school on a gap year. We learnt heaps as visiting supply teachers of English and Mathematics, thanks to an introduction from a mutual contact Angus Barker. Figure 0.15: The Moravian Institute lies in the foothills of the Himalayas between Dehradun in the Doon Valley and the hill station of Mussoorie. Situated between the Yamuna and Ganges, the institute was founded in 1963 by the late Reverend Eliyah Thsetsan Phuntsog of the Moravian Church in Ladakh, Jammu &amp; Kashmir state to provide education for Tibetan refugees fleeing from their homeland across the Himalayas. So thanks Moravians (and Angus) for a life changing and formative experience. üôè 0.7.11 Thanks to influencers Some of the most important influences on this guidebook are people I‚Äôve only met very briefly (in person), virtually (online only) or not at all (yet). Thanks to Gayle Laakman McDowell (@gayle), for her cracking series of books (McDowell 2014, 2015; McDowell and Bavaro 2013; Bavaro and McDowell 2021) which have been very useful resources both for students I‚Äôve worked with and me personally Thanks to Yihui Xie (@yihui) for bookdown.org, the software used to produce this book alongwith the comprehensive and well-written documentation on using it. [Xie (2017); Xie (2015); Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer (2020);] Thanks to Bronnie Ware for her The Top Five Regrets of the Dying (Ware 2011) which helped me to re-align my priorities when they were all out of kilter Thanks to blokes on the interwebs whose words I‚Äôve enjoyed reading including Tim Bray at ongoing, Paul Downey at whatfettle.com, Paul Graham at paulgraham.com, Peter Norvig at norvig.com and Neil Saunders at What you‚Äôre doing is rather desperate. Your writing is existence proof that engineers and scientists should also be good communicators. Thanks to Sophie Milliken for From Learner to Earner: A recruitment insider‚Äôs guide for students wanting to achieve graduate job success (Milliken 2019) which draws useful distinctions between graduate jobs and graduate schemes So, thanks influencers for being influential. üôè 0.7.12 Thanks to githubbers Thanks to everyone who has contributed via github. I will credit any github contributors here, small or large. Even the typos, it all counts. You can easily add yourself to this roll call by correcting my delibreate mitsakes. üòâ Keith Mitchell (@apiadventures), Jan Machacek (@janm399), Zee Somji (@ezeethg), Tsvetankov (@Tsvetankov), teobalmos (@teobalmos) If you‚Äôd like to contribute via github you can: raise an issue at github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/new click on the edit this page on any page at cdyf.me which will initiate a pull request git clone https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf.git the repository to submit pull requests from your setup submit a pull request github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/pulls So, thanks githubbers for cloning, forking, pulling, adding, committing and pushing. üôè 0.7.13 Thank you Bryan Many of the illustrations for this book have been drawn by the very talented Bryan Mathers @BryanMMathers shown in figure 0.16. Figure 0.16: Bryan Mathers Self portrait by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND Bryan is an artist, visual thinker and entrepreneur, who also happens to have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Glasgow. His combined skills in art, science and engineering made him the perfect fit for illustrating this guidebook. You can find out more about Bryan at bryanmathers.com and visualthinkery.com. I‚Äôm sooo glad we randomly bumped into each other at a conference shown in figure 8.2. So, thanks Bryan for your witty illustrations, this book wouldn‚Äôt be the same without your visual thinkery. üôè 0.7.14 Thanks to my friends Thanks to my friends, especially those who I‚Äôve enjoyed singing, dancing and live music with. I hope we can sing and dance together to live music again before too long. So, thank you friends for your friendship. üôè 0.7.15 Thanks to my family To my mum, dad, brother, sister, wife, son, ŒºŒ±ŒºŒ¨, ŒºœÄŒ±ŒºœÄŒ¨ and extended family: I‚Äôm lucky to have been taught by you and that you‚Äôve always been there when I needed you. üá¨üá∑¬∑üá™üá∫¬∑üá¨üáß So, thanks to all my family for your unconditional love. Œ£Œµ Œ±Œ≥Œ±œÄœé œÄŒ±œÅŒ± œÄŒøŒªœç. üôè 0.8 About me Hello, my name is Duncan Hull and I wrote this guidebook for students at the University of Manchester where I‚Äôm a lecturer (‚âà Assistant Professor) in the Department of Computer Science. So what‚Äôs my story? Like many people, my path has been what Helen Tupper and Sarah Ellis call a ‚Äúsquiggly career‚Äù rather than classic linear one. (Tupper and Ellis 2020) I‚Äôve been gainfully employed as a paperboy, supermarket cashier, shelf stacker, sausage factory worker, pork pie filler, chef, dogsbody, field assistant, database administrator, deli counter server, consultant, matchday steward, envelope stuffer, high school teacher, postdoc, research scientist, software engineer, lecturer, external examiner, tutor and academic. I‚Äôve done a range of voluntary work too, serving as a competition judge, fundraiser, rabble rouser, code club &amp; coderdojo leader, digital council member, school governor, curator, librarian, beer drinker, wikipedia trainer, journal clubber and editor. But as Ronnie Lane and Ronnie Wood once said: ‚ÄúI wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger.‚Äù ‚ÄîRonnie Lane (Lane and Wood 1979) This guidebook documents some of what I know now, that I wish I‚Äôd known, when I was younger. If you‚Äôre starting your career, I hope you find these insights useful. I‚Äôve sat on both sides of the interview table, as interviewer and interviewee. I have had some spectacular failures, alongside some modest successes, and have included personal stories where they are relevant. Most of what I have learned about employment comes from listening to, and watching students interact with employers as they take the first tentative steps in their careers. I‚Äôve documented some of what they taught me, so reading this book may help you learn from some of their successes and failures. 0.9 Legal stuff I am not a lawyer (IANAL) but any opinions expressed in this guidebook are my own and not representative of my current employer, the University of Manchester and therefore do not represent University policy.

So before we get started, let‚Äôs tackle a fundamental design issue. Why the hell would you want to bother with your future? Why should you bother with reading this pesky guidebook when you have so many other things on your plate right now: You are a busy person, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è Your time is a precious and finite resource, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è You could be spending that precious time right now in lots of other ways, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è There are mountains of self-help guides and courses already, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è Do you really need yet another guidebook? YES! ‚òëÔ∏è You need this guidebook because it is different to all the other guidebooks! It will help you design, test, build, code and debug your future in computing. Come with me down the rabbit-hole in Figure 1.1 and let me explain‚Ä¶ üêá Figure 1.1: Shall we go down the rabbit hole? Rabbit Hole learning by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND 1.1 What you will learn After reading this chapter you will be able to: Identify and decide which parts of this book you are going to read Set your expectations for using this guidebook Travel down the rabbit hole into the underworld of work 1.2 Let‚Äôs go down the rabbit hole In the novel Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland (Caroll 1865), the heroine Alice follows a white rabbit down a hole. What she discovers is a strange underground world populated by weird and wonderful characters. The world of work can sometimes be a mysterious underworld where you adventure in wonderland accompanied by colourful characters. You will spend lots of time in this wonderland, potentially as much as 80,000 hours of your life. (Investor 2019, 2020) So join me down the rabbit hole, it‚Äôs fun (honest), and sooner or later you‚Äôll have come down here anyway. 1.3 Your future is your responsibility When Andy Stanford-Clark started working at IBM, fresh out of University, his boss gave him the following advice: ‚ÄúNobody cares about your career except you.‚Äù ‚ÄîAnon (Stanford-Clark 2019) Andy is now Master Inventor and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at IBM in the UK so it was probably good advice. Another, slightly more positive way of putting the advice is, the person who cares most about your career is you. So while there are people who can help design and build your future, ultimately it is YOU who has to take responsibility for the implementation (if you like, the code). The sooner you get coding the better. At University, there are lots of people can help design and build your future: peers, academic staff, friends, your careers service, employers and your wider network but ultimately it is your responsibility to sort out whatever comes next. That might sound obvious but don‚Äôt wait for somebody else to do it for you, because it probably won‚Äôt happen. 1.4 Your degree is not enough You‚Äôve worked incredibly hard to get the grades you needed to get into University. You‚Äôve spent (or are spending) a significant amount of time and money studying whatever it is you are studying at University. Under these circumstances, you might be tempted to believe that the world owes you something in return for your hard work. Unfortunately that‚Äôs not the case. At some point during or after your study, you might find yourself applying for a graduate job or graduate scheme. EVERYONE applying for these opportunities will have a degree or be rapidly on their way to getting one. So having a degree isn‚Äôt going to set you apart much from your competition. Even having a first class degree (Coughlan 2019a; Borrett 2019) may not distinguish you that much your competitors. Some employers would rather not know (or don‚Äôt care) what University you went to, so your education might not make you stand out as much as you might like anyway. (Agnew 2016) What will distinguish you from your competitors will be your experience, your projects, your communication skills and any awards or honours you might have picked up along the way. If you think that your degree will be enough to get you the job you want, bear in mind that: There are more and more graduates, the UK for example recently passed the milestone of 50% of young people going into higher education. This compares to just 15% of over 18s who stayed in higher education in 1980 (Coughlan 2019b) The increase in the number of graduate schemes and graduate jobs has not kept pace with this growth in graduates which means that each graduate job or graduate scheme has more and more graduates applying for it There are lots of graduates in your discipline, for example around 9,000 every year in Computer Science alone in the UK. What makes you different from the other 8,999 computer scientists graduating in your year? Figure 1.2: Percentage of young people in the UK going into higher education between 1980 and 2018. Over the last forty years, the proportion of young people going into higher education has more than doubled from 15% in 1980 to over 50% in 2018. Data taken from BBC news article on the symbolic target of 50% at university reached (Coughlan 2019b) Computing is one of the largest subject areas in UK higher education, and is taught in almost every institution, graduating around 9,000 students every year ‚ÄìSally Fincher (Fincher and Finlay 2016) Now, don‚Äôt be disillusioned by the statistics because a degree can open doors to many careers in computing. What the data in Figure 1.2 show is that you‚Äôll need to look beyond your formal education to distinguish yourself from your competition. Your degree can certainly help you start a career, but it is typically not enough by itself. 1.5 Maximising your future Studying at University is a significant investment of your time and money. Hopefully, you‚Äôve picked a subject that stimulates and challenges you intellectually while allowing you to find and develop your unique talents. But there‚Äôs another reason that you probably chose to study at University and that was to improve your job prospects. This guidebook will: Help you maximise the return on the substantial investment of time and money (ROI) you‚Äôve put into your study Give you an overview of important professional issues that are sometimes neglected or sidelined in University curricula Highlight and review essential resources beyond this guidebook that will help with the above All of the resources that can help you are scattered around in lots of different places. There are books, there are videos, there are podcasts, there are websites and jobs boards. There are online courses, blogs, social media, newspaper columns, journal articles, marketing material and many other good resources. It is overwhelming. 1.6 Too late when you graduate You might be tempted to postpone making difficult career decisions. I‚Äôll do it tomorrow. I‚Äôll do it next week. I‚Äôll do it next year. I‚Äôll finish this assignment. I‚Äôll finish this exam. I‚Äôll finish this semester. Procrastination is a part of the human condition (Graham 2005): ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get my degree out of the way first then worry about jobs and careers when I finish University‚Äù ‚ÄìPro Crastinator It probably doesn‚Äôt help that many of issues described and discussed in this book are typically not closely integrated into the curriculum in Higher Education. You‚Äôll often find them on the edges, or completely outside of, standard University curricula. Broadly speaking, the professional issues described in this book are usually covered by pastoral support systems, counselling services, careers services, trade organisations, professional bodies, student unions and their societies,. Despite being sidelined, these issues matter and it is in your own selfish interests to start thinking about them right now. According to recent estimates by Investors in People, the average person spends 80,000 hours working during their lifetime. (Investor 2020) So, whatever you end up doing after University, you‚Äôll be spending a lot of time doing it. Difficult decisions often get sidelined but it is never too early to start thinking about them and doing something. The sooner you start thinking about them the better decisions you‚Äôll make about what comes next. It‚Äôs too late when you graduate. That doesn‚Äôt mean you have to know EXACTLY what you want to do when you finish. Lots of students don‚Äôt and I certainly didn‚Äôt when I graduated. I‚Äôd done a gap year teaching in India, two summer internships (in Sweden and the United States) and a year-in-industry in the UK and I still graduated with no clue as to what I wanted to do next! The important thing is that you make a start, and sometimes knowing what you don‚Äôt want to do is just as valuable as knowing what you do. Computer scientists call this problem ‚Äúsearch space reduction,‚Äù (Ferrari, Marin-Jimenez, and Zisserman 2008) because you have a feasible region of future possibilities and you need to narrow down the candidates. You could think of coding your future as an optimisation problem. Start optimising now because it‚Äôs too late when you graduate. üéì 1.7 Yes, this WILL be on the exam Students love to ask their teachers ‚Äúwill this be on the exam?‚Äù The short answer is YES (and NO)! Yes, this will be on the exam, but NO the exam won‚Äôt be set by your University. Unlike other courses you‚Äôve done, the examinations for this course aren‚Äôt set by your University but by employers. Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of examinations that you‚Äôll need to get good at, shown in Table 1.1 Table 1.1: Examining your future: The ‚Äúexams‚Äù used by employers, what gets assessed and the grades you can get Examination What examiners are assessing Grade CV, application form covering letter Should we invite you to interview ? Can you communicate well in writing? pass/fail Interview Should we offer you a job? Can you communicate well verbally? Can you communicate well nonverbally? pass/fail Employee performance Should we promote you? Should we give you a pay rise? Should we extend your contract? pass/fail So, yes, this will be on the exam, but no, the exams are obviously not set, administered, invigilated and marked by academics at your University. The exams are set by employers and the results are brutally binary: PASS: you‚Äôve got the interview, job or promotion or‚Ä¶ FAIL: none of the above. Next! One of the challenging things about employers exams are, they typically do not have the bandwidth to give applicants useful feedback, other than a simple pass or fail. When it comes to job applications software engineer Gayle Laakmann McDowell calls this the ‚Äúblack hole.‚Äù The gravitational force of employers black holes is so strong that no CV or Resume can escape, we‚Äôll say more about this in chapter on debugging your CV. Figure 1.3: no this will not be on the exam set by University, but yes it will be on the exams set by employers. Some of the most important exams you sit at (and after) University are set by employers. This guidebook will help you prepare for those exams and increase your chances of passing them. Gimme some credit figure by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND It‚Äôs a similar story with interviews, if you fluffed and interview question or came across badly, it can be really difficult to find out from the employer what you did wrong. 1.8 Practicing your future There are practical exercises, for you to get your hands dirty with. Each chapter incorporates activities including individual exercises, group exercises, quizzes and points for wider discussion. Just reading a guidebook won‚Äôt get you very far, you‚Äôll need to do the activities in this book to get the most out of it. 1.9 Navigating your future There are lots of resources out there that offer self-help, career advice and techniques for self-improvement. It can be hard to know where to start, or even how to find your way around the mountains of advice. Figure 1.4: There are tonnes of resources out there offering advice on the huge range of professional issues. You can‚Äôt read them all, but this guide will help you navigate the resources that will be most interesting and useful to you Lots of professional advice is readily available, but how will you navigate it? This book signposts you to what I think are the most important resources, each chapter has a signposts section, and they are all gathered together in the signpost at the end alongside everything (yes, EVERYTHING!) that this guidebook cites in the References. 1.10 Crediting your future Get credit for your contributions. As well as being openly accessible on the web, this book is open source too. What this means is, you can contribute in several ways View the entire book source on github at github.com/dullhunk/cdyf Click the Edit this page, which appears on the right hand side of every chapter with the octocat logo Raise an issue github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/new Submit a pull request github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/pulls, If you‚Äôre not familiar with pull requests, see makeapullrequest.com Email me suggestions for improvements if you don‚Äôt want to use github Any corrections or suggestions that get included will be fully acknowledged in the acknowledgements, unless you tell me otherwise. We welcome all improvements, however small. All the written content for this guidebook is licensed under CC-BY-NC-ND, see the license. 1.11 Your future is different I wrote this guidebook because I needed a resource for students to help them design, build, test and debug their futures. I wanted a single resource that could help students compete for jobs while at University, or shortly after graduating. I could not find anything suitable that met all the requirements of the students I was teaching. So I wrote this one which contains some new material and recommends the best resources if you want to know more. These are found in the signposts sections of each chapter. This book aims to combine these perspectives and to be different from existing resources in the following ways: 1.11.1 Your future is signposted Some career resources claim (or imply) that they are the all you will need to solve a particular problem or worse: solve all of your problems! Just buy this book, do this course, watch this video, listen to this podcast and all your problems will go away! Rather than continue this trend, this book signposts some of the most useful resources. Scientists call this citation, rather than signposting. I‚Äôve signposted and cited sources in this guidebook so that you can : Check and verify any facts and claims I make in this book for yourself Go and consult the original sources if you think they might be useful While this guidebook cites lots of resources, some of them are more important than others. Each chapter summarises these in a signposts section. You‚Äôll find everything else in the references section. The University of Manchester has physical and electronic copies of many (but sadly not all) of the books listed here. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you read all these books right now, but that if a particular chapter has piqued your interest, these signposts are good places to keep going, if you haven‚Äôt already read them. I hope you‚Äôll find these signposts handy for navigating the mountains of advice. Not all who wander are lost. üó∫Ô∏è 1.11.2 Guiding your future This guidebook to your future accompanies a course that has been co-designed by students for students, with input from academics and employers. It unites several disparate themes into one coherent story, from fundamental questions about identity and wellbeing through to more applied and practical advice on job hunting, career progression and life after University. Resources that do this are typically scattered around in many different places. There is usually no narrative to tie them all together to help students navigate the mountains of advice as embark on the first stages of their careers. Although this is a course guidebook used in the second year undergraduate teaching, you don‚Äôt need to be enrolled on the course to benefit from reading it, watching the videos and doing the exercises and coding challenges. 1.11.3 Your future is constantly updated You are reading the alpha version, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of this guidebook. That‚Äôs software engineer talk for saying it isn‚Äôt finished yet. Subsequent versions, will be continuously and iteratively released on a daily and weekly basis. They will include: More quizzes for better interactivity More videos on the Coding your Future YouTube channel Audio podcasts in the Coding your Future More illustrations throughout the book Improved content, finish incomplete chapters Fix bugs and typos Your suggestions for improvements and corrections, via github etc I‚Äôm taking a Release Early, Release Often (Raymond 1999) approach to publishing this guidebook, you could call it agile book development. (Schuh 2004) Agile: make it up as you go along. Waterfall: make it up before you start, live with the consequences.&mdash; Paul Downey (@psd) February 19, 2015 1.11.4 I‚Äôm deliberately writing in first person narrative A lot of scientific and technical writing is written in the third person or passive voice, which is fine for academic writing, but can alienate readers. I have opted to use first person narrative where possible as it is shorter, and hopefully more engaging for you to read. (Poundstone 2013) Where relevant, I‚Äôve told stories to illustrate key points. 1.11.5 Your future has no paywall You don‚Äôt need to pay anything to read this book online because its openly available, see the license terms (CC-BY-NC-ND). Publishing this guidebook online makes it findable and accessible, something that isn‚Äôt true of lots of knowledge locked up inside other books. Because this guidebook is online, it is searchable, browsable and linkable. You can link to whatever level you like, top level, chapter level and to every section and subsection level. Everything important has a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). 1.11.6 Your future has audio &amp; video This book is not just words and pictures, but includes audio and video as well, especially: videos produced by third parties that are worth watching audio produced by third parties that are worth listening to, either individual episodes or whole series short videos produced by me, which augment the written content of this book, see the Coding your Future YouTube channel the coding your future podcast which interviews undergraduate students 1.12 Engaging your future I‚Äôve tried to make the content of this book as engaging as possible by including pictures and conversations. Your future is deliberately playful and light-hearted. If you think it can be improved, let me know. I always welcome constructive feedback, especially when it comes via a pull request. Let&#39;s go Captain pic.twitter.com/LN33dh5dip&mdash; VeraM üá¨üá∑üá¨üáßüá™üá∫ (@FonikhSoupia) July 22, 2020 1.13 Signposting your future Each chapter in this book has a signposts section, highlighting key reading, watching or listening you could do next. This chapter has addressed the question of why should you bother coding your future? The answer is that your future is your responsibility and no-one elses. There are lots of people can help shape your future, but none more than yourself. Software engineer Robert C. Martin argues this point in his book The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers. (Martin 2011) What‚Äôs good about The Clean Coder is that it is short (only 200 pages), well written and to the point. The main part of the book covers professional issues in software engineering, some of which I discuss in surviving your future, so The Clean Coder is an essential signpost for chapter 10 as well. 1.14 Summarising your future If all that was too long, didn‚Äôt read (TL;DR) for you, then you‚Äôll be relieved to hear that each chapter (including this one) has a TL;DR summary. Figure 1.5: Too long, didn‚Äôt read? TL;DR by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND The TL;DR for this chapter is, you should read this guidebook because it will help you design, build, test, debug and code your future in computing.

Why? We‚Äôre hardwired to love stories because they help us understand our world and are essential to our evolution. We use stories to organise and communicate our surroundings and our past, present and future‚Äù ‚ÄîHeather Box and Julian Mocine-McQueen (Box and Mocine-McQueen 2019) Self-awareness, understanding who you are, is important for leading a healthy and happy life, and likely to be an important factor in your future success. One way to develop self-awareness is to think about what your story is. (Box and Mocine-McQueen 2019) How did you get here, where are you going, what has inspired you? Who is the authentic you? (Ware 2011) What are your hopes and dreams? By starting to answer these questions you will gain a better understanding of who you are. This includes strengths, weaknesses, motivation and values. (Bolles 2019) Universities offer many opportunities for self improvement, self discovery and developing your unique skills. One way to build your self-awareness is to reflect on your knowledge, values and skills. In Waldorf education this is characterised as ‚Äúhead, heart and hands.‚Äù (Easton 1997) Head: What do you know? Heart: What do you value, what motivates you? Hands: What can you do? What have you done so far? What will you do in the future? Answering these questions will help you understand your story. 2.3 Ikigai: What is the meaning of life? Many of the learning outcomes described above are non-trivial. You may have good self-awareness and be able to describe aspects of who you are in a matter of minutes. Other personality traits make take longer to realise. You can develop better self-awareness by describing four attributes shown in Figure 2.2, together these are known as your ikigai (Áîü„ÅçÁî≤Êñê) or ‚Äúreason for being.‚Äù what do you love doing? what are you good at? what does the world need? what can you be paid for? Figure 2.2: Reasons for being, a concept in Japanese known as ‚Äúikigai.‚Äù Image by Emmy van Deurzen on Wikimedia Commons. According to ikigai, a meaningful life combines doing four things. 1. What you are good at 2. What you love 3. What the world needs and 4. What you can get paid for. Illustration by Nimbosa derived from works in the public domain by Dennis Bodor and Emmy van Deurzen, CC BY-SA 4.0 on Wikimedia Commons w.wiki/qWT You‚Äôll be lucky if you can find activities at the intersection of all four sets shown Figure 2.2. In practice, you may realistically only be able to achieve one, two or three. That said, it‚Äôs still a valuable exercise to think about what is in each category for you. 2.4 Self assess your ikigai Take a sheet of paper, draw the four overlapping rings shown in Figure 2.2, and spend five to ten minutes adding things in each ring. What are your values? What motivates you? Are there things you like doing that you aren‚Äôt particularly good at? Why does that make them enjoyable? Figure 2.3: How well do you know yourself. Know who you are sketch by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND Thinking about your ikigai will clarify your knowledge of yourself. Some parts of your identity are so important that they are protected by legislation, in the UK and in other countries. The next section looks at those. 2.5 Your protected characteristics Some of your characteristics are protected. The Equality Act of 20103 protects you from discrimination at work or in education, based on what are known as ‚Äúprotected characteristics.‚Äù (UK 2020b). This means that: Your age should not determine how you are treated Your disabilities should not determine how you are treated Your gender should not determine how you are treated (Saini 2018; Damore 2017; Lewis 2017; Bates 2016) Your gender re-assignment should not determine how you are treated Your marriage or civil partnership should not determine how you are treated Your pregnancy and maternity should not determine how you are treated Your race (including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin) should not determine how you are treated (Eddo-Lodge 2017; Saini 2019) Your religion or beliefs should not determine how you are treated Your sex should not determine how you are treated (Price 2019) Your sexual orientation should not determine how you are treated (Britton 2019) 2.6 Coding challenges This chapter has looked at some big issues around identity, by inviting you to think about some fundamental questions. Another way to think about these questions is as coding challenges. They are non-trivial questions to answer, it might take you weeks, months or even years to answer some of them. But they are worth spending time thinking about What are your values? What makes you happy? What do you want to get from your time at University? What do you want after University? Where do you see yourself in x years time? The signposts in the next section may help tackle some of these coding challenges. 2.7 Signposts from here on identity This chapter challenges you to reflect on who you are and what you‚Äôre good at. We‚Äôve only scratched the surface, so if you want to dig deeper you‚Äôll find the following resources useful: The Top Five Regrets of the Dying What Colour is Your Parachute? How Your Story Sets You Free A range of books about privilege 2.7.1 Your dying regrets? One of The Top Five Regrets of the Dying (Ware 2011) is that people wish they‚Äôd had the courage to live a life true to themselves, and not a life that others expected of them. Figuring out exactly who your authentic self is can be challenging. Bronnie Ware‚Äôs book might help, it has some very moving, personal and insightful true stories of peoples regrets that will illuminate your own values and might just change your life. The top five regrets, outlined in the book are: I wish I‚Äôd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me I wish I hadn‚Äôt worked so hard I wish I‚Äôd had the courage to express my feelings I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends I wish that I had let myself be happier You need to be courageous to live a regret-free life but the alternative is to die full of regret, see Bronnie‚Äôs video in figure 2.4. Figure 2.4: Palliative care nurse Bronnie Ware explains the top five regrets of the dying. (Ware 2017) Bronnie learned a lot from looking after people on their deathbeds, then wrote it all down in a fantastic book (Ware 2011). 2.7.2 Colouring your parachute Since first being published in 1972, over ten million copies of What Colour is Your Parachute? have been sold. It has been translated into 20 languages and is used in 26 countries. What is good about Parachute is that it has some useful self-inventory exercises that go beyond the introductory ones in this guidebook, particularly in the context of your future career. While the style and examples can be U.S. centric, it‚Äôs a classic self-help book that looks at a broad variety of issues around job hunting. The author, Richard Nelson Bolles was a Harvard educated chemical engineer and he explains how you can‚Äôt possibly decide what to do in five years time in the video in figure 2.5. Where do you see yourself in five years time? is a question some interviewers like to ask. Figure 2.5: Where will you be five years from now? Best-selling author Dick Bolles talks at the Googleplex about the gaps between education and employment. (Bolles 2014) 2.7.3 What‚Äôs your story? A useful technique for developing self-awareness is to think about what your story is. Heather Box and Julian Mocine-McQueen‚Äôs book How Your Story Sets You Free (Box and Mocine-McQueen 2019) takes a storytelling approach to help you gain a better picture of who you are and what you value. What‚Äôs good about this book is its short, less than 100 pages and contains practical exercises which extend those in this chapter. 2.7.4 Check your privileges Reflecting on your identity should lead you to check any privileges you might have. Being grateful for any privileges you may have is also beneficial for your mental health which we talk about in the chapter on your well-being So: If you‚Äôre white a good place to start understanding your white privileges is Why I‚Äôm No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo Lodge (Eddo-Lodge 2017) and Superior: The Return of Race Science by Angela Saini If you‚Äôre male a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of being a man is Inferior by Angela Saini (Saini 2018) If you‚Äôre socially privileged a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of your class is The Class Ceiling: Why it Pays to be Privileged by Sam Friedman and Daniel Laurison (Friedman and Laurison 2020). If you were privately educated in Britain (or elsewhere) you should read Engines of Privilege: Britain‚Äôs Private School Problem (Green and Kynaston 2019) If you‚Äôre heterosexual a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of your sexual orientation is Ben Britton‚Äôs presentation on No sexuality please, we‚Äôre scientists (Britton 2019) which covers bisexuality and homosexuality, including lesbian and gay homosexuality If you‚Äôre gender binary a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of being gender binary is Ben Britton‚Äôs presentation (Britton 2019) which also covers transgender, genderqueer, non-binary and plus identities There is a lot more to your identity than your race, class, gender and sexual orientation, see your protected characteristics. 2.8 Summarising self awareness Too long, didn‚Äôt read (TL;DR)? Here‚Äôs a summary: This chapter has looked at who you are. Being self aware, understanding your strengths and weaknesses is key to getting what you want from your career. Questions about your identity are non-trivial, hopefully this chapter has started you thinking about who you are, what motivates you and what you want out of life. You need to keep thinking about your identity because some aspects of your identity may be constantly changing. These are fundamental design questions you‚Äôll need to address when you starting building your future. We touched on understanding any privileges you may have as being important for understanding who you are but also in being beneficial for your mental health. In the next chapter, we‚Äôll look at mental health in more detail.

To be successful at studying or working, you need to take your well-being seriously. By well-being, I mean your health and happiness. Your health isn‚Äôt just about your physical health but also your mental health and the two are very closely linked. It‚Äôs all too easy when you are busy or stressed to neglect your well-being and then bad-stuff‚Ñ¢ happens. This chapter looks at your well-being, and how you can nurture and look after it.

This chapter just gives you a quick overview of mental health and points you to where you can find out more. 3.2 Mental ill health Stress can lead to many kinds of ill health. Turing was being put under lots of stress by his government bosses, people like Alastair Denniston and Stewart Menzies. (Tyldum 2014) On describing his work for the government and why he punished himself so much in training, Alan Turing said: ‚ÄúI have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard; it‚Äôs the only way I can get some release‚Äù ‚ÄìAlan Turing. (Kottke 2018) University is a positive experience for many people, however like Alan, you may also experience periods of stress. This may also be accompanied by anxiety, loneliness and depression. Financial, social and academic pressures alongside concerns about employability and an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 can all have an impact on your wellbeing. Statistically, one in four of us will be affected by mental ill health during our lifetime. Two of the most common forms of mental ill health are: Anxiety: persistent feelings of unease, such as worry or fear Depression: a low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life The persistent and lasting a long time are important here because while its part of the human condition to worry and feel low, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you are affected by poor mental health. 3.2.1 Anxiety Anxiety is one of most prevalent mental health disorders and can lead to depression, increased risk of suicide. Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), a common form of anxiety is explained in the video in Figure 3.2 and at nhs.uk/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder. People who are affected by anxiety may struggle to function normally, and find routine everyday task difficult or impossible. Figure 3.2: Generalised anxiety disorder is a condition characterised by excessive, persistent and unreasonable amounts of anxiety and worry about everyday things. (Desai 2016) Note that the video takes an American perspective using American terminology such as DSM‚Äì5. 3.2.2 Depression Millions of people around the world live with depression. If you are affected by depression it can be really hard to talk about it as there are many social stigmas around mental health. Thankfully depression is largely preventable and treatable. Recognising depression and seeking help is the first and most critical step towards recovery. To mark World Mental Health Day writer and illustrator Matthew Johnstone tells the story of how he overcame the ‚Äúblack dog of depression‚Äù in the video in Figure 3.3 made in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO). Figure 3.3: Matthew Johnstone explains how he overcame the affects of depression, using the metaphor of the black dog (Johnstone 2012) 3.2.3 Drugs Sometimes the drugs don‚Äôt work, they just make you worse. (Ashcroft 1997) Medication can help some people with their mental health. For example, when I was affected by depression, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) worked for me. But they don‚Äôt for everybody. Some doctors prescribe benzodiazepines for anxiety, which may be effective where SSRI‚Äôs are not, but these can be addictive and have big side effects. It is often worth considering cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) before taking any medication. The Science of Wellbeing (TSOWB) at coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being is an easy way to access some CBT free online. See the signposts section at the end of this chapter (Santos 2021) 3.3 Look after yourself Looking after yourself can serve to both prevent and treat mental health issues that can affect you in life. You might be your own worst critic, or perhaps when you‚Äôre under pressure you neglect things that are proven to be beneficial for your mental health, like sleep, exercise, mindfulness and friendship. Looking after yourself means at least three things: being mindful of your feelings and learning to ignore your inner critic being kind to yourself in various ways deliberately scheduling protected time to do the non-work things that matter. Figure 3.4: It‚Äôs important not to neglect your body, mind, soul and social life when you‚Äôre working hard. Look after yourself by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND Harvard Psychologist Laurie Santos describes five evidence-based strategies for coping when times are really challenging and tough in the video in figure 3.5. Those strategies are: Exercise: getting regular exercise improves both physical AND mental health. Gratitude: research shows that being grateful can significantly improve your mental health. One way to do this is by keeping a gratitude journal, a log you fill in everyday of things you are grateful for (either small or big) Sleep: actively developing healthier sleep patterns. Poor sleep hygiene can be both cause and effect of poor mental health. See the discussion of Why we sleep (Walker 2018) in the signposts section below Socialising: prioritise time with friends and family, rather than turning inward or diving deeper into work Mindfulness: be mindful of emotions using the R.A.I.N. technique: Recognise: negative emotions Accept: accept emotions rather than fighting them Investigate: notice how the emotion feels inside your body Nurture: be kind to yourself Laurie explains the R.A.I.N. technique in figure 3.5. Figure 3.5: Laurie Santos describes five coping techniques for improving wellbeing: Exercise, gratitude, sleep, getting social and meditation (Santos 2020). So there are things you can do to help yourself, but you may also need to seek help from others. Sometimes a desire to be productive by working hard has the opposite effect, because the sacrifices you make can be counter-productive. pic.twitter.com/D2SP4iJspT&mdash; lizandmollie (@lizandmollie) February 23, 2020 3.4 Help is available if you need it If you are affected by mental ill health, particularly anxiety or depression, it can be hard: to recognise that you need help in the first place to help yourself using self-help resources to ask others to help you Even if you don‚Äôt need help, its important to recognise and understand the symptoms of mental ill health. It‚Äôs quite likely that someone you know will suffer from mental health issues and as their friend or peer, it might be you that can help by encouraging them to get the help they wouldn‚Äôt otherwise ask for. You are not alone, help is available if you (or your friends) need it from a wide variety of sources: 3.4.1 Your University There are lots of people who can help you: your personal tutor or other academic members of staff non-academic staff in the University, for example in Manchester contact the Student Support Office (SSO) studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk counselling services, for example contact counsellingservice.manchester.ac.uk. The counselling service offers help on dealing with anxiety, depression, exam stress, confidence and other issues. peers, flat-mates, family, friends etc. People close to you can help, although some people affected by mental health find it easier to discuss mental health with a trained professional or volunteer because of the social stigmas. There are lots of services outlined below that provide this kind of service. 3.4.2 The National Health Service As a student studying in the UK you are entitled to access free healthcare provided by the National Health Service (NHS) of the United Kingdom. To do so you‚Äôll need to be registered with your general practitioner (GP), see nhs.uk: Getting medical care as a student Your doctor can advise you on medical treatment if required, see for example nhs.uk/conditions/antidepressants 3.4.3 Nightline Nightline nightline.ac.uk is a confidential listening and information service run by students for students. Nightline is open 8pm till 8am every night during term time. It offers anonymous, non-judgmental and non-advisory support for students as described in figure 3.6. Figure 3.6: Students explain in their own words how calling Nightline helped them whilst at university. (Association 2016) Manchester students can contact nightline at nightmail@nightline.manchester.ac.uk and expect a reply within 48 hours. See manchester.nightline.ac.uk for details. 3.4.4 The Samaritans The Samaritans are a charity who provide emotional support to anyone in the the United Kingdom and Ireland that: is suffering from emotional distress is struggling to cope is at risk of suicide The name of the charity comes from the Parable of the Good Samaritan although the organisation itself is not religious. The Samaritans are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to talk confidentially about any problem, however big or small. See samaritans.org or telephone 116 123. 3.4.5 Students Against Depression Students Against Depression (SAD) acknowledge the devastating impact that depression can have on those experiencing it, as well as on their friends, family and supporters. For further help in understanding and coping with suicidal thoughts, and emergency contacts in a crisis, visit studentsagainstdepression.org Actor Ruby Wax has written about mental health and how the ‚Äúinternal critics‚Äù in our minds can send us mad in her book Sane New World. (Wax 2014b) She is interviewed by Students Against Depression in the video in figure 3.7 about using mindfulness to ‚Äúdodge the bullets‚Äù of depression. Figure 3.7: Ruby Wax describes being affected by depression in her childhood and how mindfulness and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) provided an alternative to medical treatment enabling her to dodge the bullets of mental health. (Wax 2014a) 3.4.6 Papryus Suicide is the biggest killer of under 35‚Äôs in the UK. Papyrus believe that many young suicides can be prevented, they are a national charity that you can find out more about at papyrus-uk.org or telephone the free number 0800 068 4141. 3.4.7 Self-help services Self-Help services are a mental health charity which helps people to help themselves, see selfhelpservices.org.uk or phone 0161 226 3871. 3.4.8 MIND MIND provide advice and support to empower anyone experiencing a mental health problem. They campaign to improve services, raise awareness and promote understanding of mental health issues.

The service has an active forum with round-the-clock support from trained professionals. You can talk anonymously to other members and take part in group or 1-to-1 therapy with therapists. Togetherall is for anyone aged 16 or over who wants to improve their mental health. The service is free for many universities. Find out more at togetherall.com and in the video in figure 3.10 which describes why its important to talk about student mental health. Figure 3.10: A quick look inside togetherall, an online community for people who are stressed, anxious or feeling low. (togetherall 2020) 3.5 Developing a growth mindset Learning at University can be hard because you might have gone from being at (or near) the top of the class in high school to no longer being top of the class at University. Likewise the job hunting we describe in the chapter on searching can take a heavy toll on your mental health because repeated rejection is an ordinary part of the process. It can be time consuming, stressful and demoralising. You may find your applications disappear into a black hole. They will be ghosted (ignored) by employers. Interviewers will blank you and refuse to give you meaningful feedback because they‚Äôre too busy. This could happen multiple times. This is all par for the course, normal and expected, and is not necessarily a reflection on your abilities or potential. Figure 3.11: A fixed mindset is monolithic like the Easter island statues, known as Mo ªai. If you‚Äôre not already, you should be wary of a fixed mindset. Fixed mindsets by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND Adopting a growth mindset can be a successful strategy for maintaining your wellbeing, see figure 3.11. If your grades aren‚Äôt has good as you hoped or your search for employment is being met with repeated rejection, a growth mindset can help. Let‚Äôs take rejection from potential employers as an example, there are two ways you can react to it: Fixed mindset: responding with a fixed mindset will mean you are likely to take rejection personally. You might even assume that this confirms what you‚Äôve always suspected. You‚Äôre not good enough or that you made some fatal mistake in your applications or interviews. Ouch. Growth mindset: by responding to rejection with a growth mindset, you focus on what happens next. Rejection is not failure but a ‚Äúnot yet‚Äù described in figure 3.12. Maybe you‚Äôre not yet ready for that employer, but you‚Äôll definitely have a good idea of what you learned from the process and how can you do better next time. According to Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck we can all be placed on a spectrum according to where we think our abilities come from. At one end, the fixed mindset assumes all kinds of abilities are fixed traits while at the other end, a growth mindset assumes these abilities can be developed over time. (Dweck 2017) There is good evidence to suggest that adopting a growth mindset will make you a better learner who can cope with the inevitable failures and rejections in life better. This approach can be used in a range of different disciplines such as learning programming languages (Cutts et al. 2010), music (Davis 2016) and job hunting. Figure 3.12: Psychologist Carol Dweck explains the power of ‚Äúnot yet‚Äù and the growth mindset (Dweck 2014) 3.6 Wellbeing signposts This chapter has looked at your wellbeing and especially the role that both your mental health and physical health play in your future. Matt Haig‚Äôs first-hand accounts of poor mental health will be comforting to anyone who is affected by mental ill health. Even if you‚Äôre not affected, there is a 25% chance you will do at some point in your life. There‚Äôs also a high probability someone close to you will suffer from mental health issues. It might be a colleague, friend, family member, fellow student or partner, so it is worth educating yourself on the issues by reading his two short books: Notes on a Nervous Planet is a personal account of anxiety (Haig 2019) Reasons to Stay Alive is a personal account of depression (Haig 2016) What‚Äôs good about Matt Haig‚Äôs books is they are quick and easy to read, but give plenty of first-hand insight into what mental ill-health can do to people (including you). Matt describes his top five tips for good mental health in figure 3.13 Figure 3.13: Two of Matt Haig‚Äôs top five tips for good mental health (Haig 2018) include 1. Being more careful (and mindful) of social media and 2. Reading more books because books are good for your soul. Not just his book. Any book. Books are good for you. Trust me on this. (Forever 2019) There‚Äôs plenty of evidence to suggest that social media can have a detrimental effect on health. Jaron Lanier‚Äôs skeptical polemic Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now (Lanier 2018) is a thought-provoking romp through some of the pitfalls of social media that may have you reaching for the delete or un-install button fairly quickly. If all these books are making you sleepy, neuroscientist Matthew Walker‚Äôs Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams may change your view on the importance of a good nights sleep. (Walker 2018) Finally, it‚Äôs well worth taking a look at Laurie Santos course on The Science of Wellbeing (TSOWB) at coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being. (Santos 2021) TSOWB course provides an alternative to medication as it follows the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). TSOWB is the most popular course at Yale University and looks at some simple techniques you can use to improve your happiness. (Shimer 2018) The course will help you increase your happiness and build more productive habits. Using the latest research, Santos describes the misconceptions about happiness and ‚Äúannoying features‚Äù of your mind that can impair your well-being. The course takes about 19 hours to complete but you can spread this over a whole semester (or longer) if you choose. The short clip in figure 3.5 gives you a brief taster of Laurie‚Äôs style and work. 3.7 Summarising well-being Too long, didn‚Äôt read (TL;DR)? Here‚Äôs a summary: Anxiety and depression are serious conditions that are very likely to affect you or somebody close to you while you are at University. There‚Äôs a one in four chance that you will be affected by mental health issues at some point in your life. We‚Äôve only talked about two particular mental health issues, anxiety and depression, but there are many other conditions such as phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, self-harm and more that are beyond the scope of this chapter. They do have one thing in common, and that is that talking about them is an important part of starting to develop better mental health. If you are affected by mental ill health, talking about it is the first place to start, but often the hardest. In this chapter, I‚Äôve outlined some ways you can help yourself alongside some of the services and people you can talk to if you need to. Despite how you might feel, you are not alone. Take my thoughts with you and when you look behind, you will surely see, a face that you recognise, you‚Äôre not alone. (Kellett, Taylor-Firth, and Boyle 1997) References "],["communicating.html", "Chapter 4 Writing your future 4.1 What you will learn 4.2 Computing is your superpower! 4.3 Communication I/0 4.4 Writing your future 4.5 Coding challenges 4.6 Summarising your soft skills", " Chapter 4 Writing your future Let‚Äôs get straight to the point of this chapter: your soft skills will take a life time to develop and are really hard use. Why? Because soft skills are about communicating with and understanding other people so that you can work together as a team toward a shared goal. Your soft skills are hard. There are very few jobs where you work on your own, and most software and hardware is designed, built, tested and used by teams of people. Many of these teams are large and have very diverse membership. This means that sooner or later you‚Äôre going to have to master the dark arts of working with other people by deploying your softer skills. üò± Figure 4.1: Unless you want to be a lighthouse keeper on a remote island, there are very few jobs where you don‚Äôt have to work as part of a team with other people. Sorry to break the bad news! This means you need to constantly improve your softer skills and provide evidence of them to potential employers. Other people sketch by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND Communicating with other people and working in teams is inherently difficult because we‚Äôre all human. There is good news and bad news‚Ä¶ THE GOOD NEWS is, people can be diligent, humble, competent, honest, caring and reliable. They can be co-operative, generous, supportive, kind, thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive, understanding, punctual and professional too! THE BAD NEWS is, unfortunately people can also be lazy, stupid, ignorant, vain, incompetent, dishonest, unreliable, greedy, egomaniacal, unpredictable and moody. They can be proud, selfish, competitive, lustful, angry, envious, mean, busy, insensitive and thoughtless too. Some will disagree with you, boss you around, betray, exploit, misunderstand and mislead you, deliberately or otherwise. (Goble 2007) So communicating with and understanding other people can be hard work, but don‚Äôt worry, everyone finds this challenging, it‚Äôs not just you! It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre an extrovert or an introvert, we all find communication difficult, and everyone can get better at it. This chapter takes a look at the softer skills and techniques you can use to improve your communication with other people, whatever mood they are in and whosever team they are on. 4.1 What you will learn Recognise the importance of written communication, both as a reader and a writer Identify examples of where written communication is crucial in science and engineering Improve your written communication skills using some simple writing and reading exercises Identify the importance of teamwork 4.2 Computing is your superpower! Studying computer science gives you an awesome superpower. We will look at some of the reasons why in the chapter on Computing your Future. But for now, let us just acknowledge that hard technical skills like computing are highly sought after and valuable, both commercially and otherwise. Figure 4.2: Computing is a superpower that gods like Hermes and heroes like Achilles would probably have envied. (Fry 2018) As a technical or ‚Äúhard skill,‚Äù computing a crucial weapon in your armoury but what are your weaker skills? What is your Achilles‚Äô heel? For some scientists and engineers, their weakness is their soft skills, such as communication and team work. This chapter looks at what you can do to improve them and convince employers that you are rounded individual with a healthy balance of soft and hard skills. Achilles heel to superpower by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND Your computational superpower is less powerful if it isn‚Äôt complemented by a broad range of softer skills. Typically, these skills are not emphasised (by repeated assessment) in most computer science degrees. This not because soft skills aren‚Äôt important but because they are hard to measure accurately. For example, if I want to know how good you are at understanding the syntax and semantics of a programming language like Python, there are tried and tested techniques for doing this. However, if I want to know how good you are at using your communication skills to work in a team, negotiate, lead, resolve conflicts, persuade others, show empathy etc that‚Äôs much harder to measure accurately. Figure 4.3: Hard skills and soft skills aren‚Äôt much use without each other. You will need both to survive and thrive but your most science and engineering education focuses on your hard skills, not your soft skills. Why? Because hard skills are often much easier to measure. Hard and soft skills sketch by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND Let‚Äôs look at some of low-level communication skills (I/O) that they are built on. 4.3 Communication I/0 In terms of input and output, your fundamental communication skills are listening, speaking, reading and writing words in natural languages shown in table 4.1. These are the ‚Äúassembly languages‚Äù of human communication. This might sound blindingly obvious, but these skills are often under-estimated or undervalued by engineers and scientists, especially undergraduates. Alongside verbal and written communication, there‚Äôs also nonverbal language, or body language such as eye contact, gestures and facial expressions. Table 4.1: The inputs and outputs of the fundamental assembly languages of human communication Input Output Written natural language Reading Writing Spoken natural language Listening Speaking Nonverbal language Observing other people Being observed by others Engineers and scientists sometimes lack communication skills outlined in table 4.1. Think of your stereotypical scientist, clad in a white coat, unable to explain the complexities of their subject to people inside their lab, let alone outside of it. Then there is the nerdy software engineer stereotype who prefers the company of computers to people. Yes, these are lazy and sometimes unhelpful stereotypes, but they express public perception of scientists and engineers as poor communicators. 4.3.1 The pen is mightier than the sword The art of communication is a huge subject which extends far beyond the scope of this guidebook. So for the rest of this chapter, we‚Äôll focus on written communication skills because: Good writing and reading are crucial in applications for employment and further study. From writing CV‚Äôs, covering letters, completing application forms and reading job specifications, and employer or course information, your ability to read and write natural languages is crucial to coding your future. Writing often gets neglected: Written communication skills (both reading and writing) are sometimes sidelined in science and engineering degrees. This is particularly true in the ‚Äúhard sciences.‚Äù For example, communicating and solving problems using code or mathematics are usually the dominant forms of assessment in computer science courses. That‚Äôs understandable given the subject, but tends to push natural languages like english to the sidelines. Good engineers are also good writers Many engineers (and scientists) could significantly improve their written communication skills. Software engineers are notoriously bad at writing good documentation, see for example Why Computer Science Students Need Language, (Beaubouef 2003) Scientists Must Write (Barrass 2002) and The Real Reason Silicon Valley Coders Write Bad Software, (Meisler 2012) just three examples amongst many others making exactly the same point. Employers like Google provide training (and a whole career path) for technical writers, see developers.google.com/tech-writing. However, I‚Äôm arguing that these careers wouldn‚Äôt be needed if software engineers were better at documenting, explaining and communicating with other human beings their code in the first place! Writing good english is like writing good code. Some of the skills you already have in coding can be transferred to written communication. Just like a good function or method in code should be well-defined with a clear purpose, your writing should also be clear and coherent. Well structured writing is a lot like well architected software too, with a clear separation of concerns (SoC) It is relatively easy to improve your written communication skills, simply by reading and writing more. Reading and writing deliberately every day, will significantly improve these skills. 4.3.2 Natural language engineering If you stop to think about it, engineers and scientists spend a lot time communicating in writing. As well as engineering code, they also spend a significant amount of time engineering messages in natural languages like english. Consider the following: email and instant messaging, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Zoom etc Posting on social media: LinkenIn, Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, blogs, Medium.com etc bug reports and messages in issue trackers like Jira, BugZilla and Trello ‚ÄòHow to‚Äô and cookbook style articles and books API reference material in-code documentation # comments in code Self-documenting code Executable specifications in test suites like cucumber.io Laboratory manuals and laboratory notebooks The one page summary for management User documentation, release notes Case studies of software use Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) YourPersonalDomain.com (if you have one) Questions and answers on forums like stackoverflow.com Commit messages in version control systems like git and mercurial etc Architecture documentation and design specifications Literate programming natural language descriptions of computational logic (Knuth 1984) Jupyter.org notebooks, code and natural language mixed together bookdown.org mixes code and natural language What do they all have in common? They‚Äôre all written in natural languages like the English language, but without them, the software or hardware they describe and discuss would be useless. 4.4 Writing your future Hopefully I‚Äôve convinced you that written communication skills (both as a writer and reader) are important soft skills that engineers often neglect. So how can you improve? 4.4.1 Try Google‚Äôs Tech Writing course Google have developed some excellent technical writing courses including: Technical Writing One: Technical Writing Fundamentals for Engineers developers.google.com/tech-writing/one Technical Writing Two: Intermediate Technical Writing for Engineers developers.google.com/tech-writing/two These courses run as part of the second year course COMP2CARS at the University of Manchester, see the course schedule for details Google occasionally delivers these technical writing courses as free sessions open to the general public. For details, see developers.google.com/tech-writing/announcements for details. 4.4.2 Deliberate daily writing Another technique for improving your written communication is to write something every day, that might be a personal diary that only you read, or it could be something more public like blog. Schedule a time every day, say 15 to 30 minutes when you will do this without fail. That writing could take several forms: private diary gratitude journal public web log or blog personal notes gathered somewhere (e.g. private github repository) bullet journal. Some people swear by it, see bulletjournal.com The technique of 30 minutes per day can be a very effective way of getting things done, incrementally over time. In my experience it works for lots of things besides writing including getting exercise (discussed in the wellbeing chapter) to gardening. (Leendertz 2006) 4.4.3 Deliberate daily reading Reading other people‚Äôs code will improve your software engineering skills. Likewise, reading other peoples writing will improve your natural language engineering skills. Read anything, it might be novels, magazines, newspapers, stuff online or any of the books cited in the references. Find a time and place to do this every day and stick to it. 4.4.4 Dogfooding Some companies test their products by trialling them on their own employees, this is sometimes known as eating your own dogfood. Tasty, tasty dogfood. üê∂ You can use a similar approach to testing your own writing, known simply as Dogfooding. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve just written a covering letter. It‚Äôs natural to read it over in your head to check for errors, before you send it. However, reading it aloud will pick up errors you may not have spotted by reading silently. There‚Äôs something about articulating words out loud that flushes out errors you don‚Äôt pick up when you read them. This is a tried and tested technique. It also means you‚Äôre ready to vocalise those answers in an interview. You might want to choose carefully where you do this as it might look a bit strange, but it works well. If you talk into a mobile phone while looking at a piece of paper, people won‚Äôt notice you‚Äôre talking to yourself. But you‚Äôll probably need some privacy as the stuff you‚Äôre talking about is likely to be personal. 4.4.5 Reading the friendly manual You don‚Äôt get good at communicating with computers (coding) by just writing lots of code. You also need to read other people‚Äôs code too and be able to understand and modify it. Likewise, you don‚Äôt get good at communicating with people by just writing stuff in natural languages like english. You need to read stuff too. Books, manuals, software documentation, articles, use cases, novels, poetry, plays, magazines, newspapers etc. Reading this stuff will help you learn and you‚Äôll improve your written communication skills too. This sentiment is commonly expressed in Computer Science as read the friendly manual (RTFM), as shown in figure 4.4 Figure 4.4: As well as learning from other people‚Äôs hard won experience, reading the friendly manual (RTFM) will also improve you written communication skills. Just like you improve your coding skills by writing and reading code, improve your written communication skills by reading and writing in natural langauges like English.

Humanities departments are a good place to start. This will improve your written communication skills Not been reading many books lately? Pick a book to read just because its interesting, rather than because you have to. 4.6 Summarising your soft skills Too long, didn‚Äôt read (TL;DR)? Here‚Äôs a summary: You‚Äôll need both soft and hard skills to compete in the workplace. Don‚Äôt underestimate the importance of softer skills, we‚Äôve looked briefly at written communication skills in this chapter but that‚Äôs only the tip of the soft skills iceberg. Teamwork, negotiation, conflict resolution, motivation and leadership are other soft skills that are important too. How can you develop these skills while at University? How can you demonstrate to potential employers that you have these skills? This chapter is under construction because I‚Äôm using agile space station development methods, see figure 4.5.

What‚Äôs relevant sketch by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND 5.2 Why is experience so valuable? It‚Äôs common for students to be focused on their grades, whether those grades are low, middling or or high. At the extremes, if you have got lower grades than you‚Äôd like, you might be anxious or unhappy about them. If you‚Äôve got higher grades, you‚Äôre probably focussed on keeping them high. Either way, you are much more than your grades, because your education is only a part of who you are, shown in in figure 5.3. You are the sum total of your experiences, this is one of the reasons that experience is so valuable. Figure 5.3: You are not your grades. Your experience tells people much more about your character, not just paid work, but any voluntary work and projects you‚Äôve been involved in too. I am more than just my grades sketch by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND 5.3 Are you experienced? So what counts as experience? Freelance work: being self-employed Insight programmes and spring weeks: work shadowing Part-time jobs: casual or part-time work 5.3.1 Big name experience It‚Äôs easier than you might think to get a big name on your CV. For example, many large employers run insight days, vacation schemes and spring weeks. These are often aimed at first years, and are sometimes less competitive to get into than a longer term commitment such as a summer internship, year-long placement or even graduate job. A big name on your CV early in your degree can help it stand out later, as fluff bucket the grinning cheshire cat demonstrates on their CV shown in 5.4. üòª Figure 5.4: It‚Äôs easier than you might think to get a big name on your CV, sometimes these can help your application stand out from the competition. Big name sketch by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND Other ways to get a big name on your CV include joining a big name competition or event, for example: Google has Code Jam, HashCode and Kick Start codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com and Summer of Code summerofcode.withgoogle.com Facebook has hackathons facebook.com/hackathon Microsoft hosts the Imagine Cup imaginecup.microsoft.com There are many others like it listed at devpost.com and Major League Hacking mlh.io Big names look good on your CV, but they are not the only way to stand out. 5.3.2 Voluntary experience Experience in the CV sense usually means paid work. However, experience in the context of are you experienced? (Hendrix 1967) means anything where you can show you‚Äôve been part of a bigger team, taken responsibility for something or tried to make the world a better place somehow. These include: Volunteering: Doing voluntary work is a good way to pick up new skills Being involved in societies: e.g. taking responsibility for things in a society Getting involved in a community, either physical or online Fixing bugs in open source software 5.3.3 Casual experience You may already have experience of paid employment as a casual or part-time worker. This could include jobs such as waiting tables, serving in a bar or working in other areas of hospitality or retail, for example as a Saturday job. Figure 5.5: Don‚Äôt discount the value of casual or part-time work on your CV. From the age of 11, I used to be a paperboy, delivering newspapers door to door to paying customers. This demonstrates reliability and work ethic, because I did this in all weathers (sun, wind, rain, snow, hangovers4 etc) for seven years, man and boy! If you have casual experienced, don‚Äôt forget to include it in your CV. Public domain image of the ‚ÄúTitanic paperboy,‚Äù Ned Parfett selling newspapers in London via Wikimedia Commons at w.wiki/35HA It is important to recognise that these jobs have value. Many students make the mistake of overlooking their casual work experience because they disregard it as non-technical or consider it ‚Äúlow-skilled.‚Äù In the section on structuring your CV, (Black 2019b) one of the stories you want to tell in your job applications is that you: take responsibility achieve things are nice to have around Doing casual work can demonstrate all of these things. For example, from the ages of 11 to 18 I was a paperboy, except unlike the one selling newspapers in the street in figure 5.5, I delivered newspapers directly to the doors of paying customers every morning. This was not a particularly highly skilled job, but it does demonstrate: work ethic: getting up early every morning (including Saturdays). Sometimes work is about just turning up everyday! taking responsibility and being reliable understanding the value of money by earning a wage If you have experience of working in retail, such as serving customers in a supermarket, this also demonstrates your ability to provide good customer service and work as part of a team. This is the ‚Äúnice to have around‚Äù bit that Jonathan Black refers to (Black 2019b) and is something your formal education will not typically provide any evidence of. So don‚Äôt fall into the trap of discounting the value of casual or part-time labour. 5.4 Summarising your experience Too long, didn‚Äôt read (TL;DR)?

Consequently, computing is a crucial skill in a wide range of careers across every sector of business and society. You don‚Äôt have to have studied Computer Science at University to take advantage of all the exciting opportunities provided by computing. This chapter looks at some of those opportunities for those with, and without, degrees in Computer Science. üë©üíªüë®üíª Figure 6.1: Computing is much more than coding, this chapter looks at what computing can do for your future.

What role will computing play in your future career? A Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University, Robert Sedgwick, has, like many others, argued that Computer Science should be required of all students: Every college student needs a computer science course, and most need two or more. More and more educators are beginning to recognize this truth, but we are a long way from meeting the need. ‚ÄìRobert Sedgwick (Sedgwick 2019) 6.3 Computational joker If academic disciplines are playing card suits, then Computer Science is the joker in the pack shown in figure 6.2. A versatile card, the computational joker can be played with (and without) any of the traditional four suits: diamonds, clubs, hearts and spades. That‚Äôs because computing is a science and an art. It allows us to study human society and culture, so it‚Äôs part of the humanities too. Last but not least, computing is also an engineering discipline and a branch of mathematics too. What all this means is that the computational joker is a wild card that can be played whenever and wherever you like, making it an incredibly powerful but dangerous card, depending on the game you are playing. ‚ô£‚ô•‚ô†‚ô¶üÉè Figure 6.2: Computer Science: The joker in the pack.

How can you support applications with a strong personal statement or covering letter? How can you debug your future? üêõ Figure 7.1: Is that a bug or a feature in your CV?

Gayle is an experienced software engineer who has worked at the biggest technology employers in the world, Apple, Microsoft and Google. She‚Äôs also authored a cracking series of books on technology careers, particularly Cracking the Coding Interview (McDowell 2015) which we‚Äôll come across in the chapter on interviewing. Gayle refers to the employer ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù: Figure 7.2: Beware of what software engineer Gayle Laakmaan McDowell calls the employer ‚ÄúBlack Hole,‚Äù especially if you‚Äôre applying to large employers. Laakmann portrait by Gayle Laakmaan is licensed CC BY 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons w.wiki/wiu Getting through the doors, unfortunately, seems insurmountable. Hoards of candidates submit resumes each year, with only a small fraction getting an interview. The online application system ‚Äì or, as it‚Äôs more appropriately nicknamed, ‚ÄúThe Black Hole,‚Äù ‚Äì is littered with so many resumes that even a top candidate would struggle to stand out. ‚ÄìGayle Laakman McDowell (McDowell 2011, 2014) If you‚Äôre applying to big employers, you‚Äôll need to create a CV that is good enough to stand out before it disappears over the event horizon and into the employment black hole. It needs to be good enough to persuade an employer to invite you to an interview. To get started, you will write this in an employer-agnostic way but you may need to come back and revisit the issues in this chapter once you have identified some target employers, so that you can customise and tailor your CV and written applications. 7.3 It‚Äôs not bug, its a feature It‚Äôs an age old trope in Computer Science that engineers use to cover their mistakes, passing off their accidental bugs as deliberate features of their work: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a bug, it‚Äôs a feature!‚Äù ‚ÄîA. Hacker (Carr 2018) Nobody likes buggy software, but we unfortunately routinely tolerate badly-designed, low quality, bug-ridden software in our everyday lives. (Mann 2002; Charette 2005) In contrast, buggy CVs are rarely tolerated, they will usually end up in the bin. Even a tiny defect, like an innocent typo, can be fetal fatal. Most employers (particularly large and well known ones) have to triage hundreds or even thousands of CV‚Äôs for any given vacancy. This means they are looking for reasons to REJECT your CV, rather than ACCEPT it, because that‚Äôs a sensible strategy for shortlisting from a huge pool of candidates for interview. A buggy CV, application and covering letter could ruin your chances of being invited to an interview. Like writing software, the challenging part of writing a CV isn‚Äôt the creation but in the debugging. Can you identify and fix the bugs before they are fatal? DISCLAIMER: If you ask three people what they think of your CV, you will get three different and probably contradictory opinions. CV‚Äôs can be very subjective thing. The &gt; advice below is based on common sense, experience and ongoing conversations with employers. What makes a good CV will depend on the personal preferences and prejudices of your reader. There are some general rules, which are described below. While referring to this guide, remember that: The main purpose of your CV is to get an interview, not a job. Your CV should catch attention and provide talking points for an interview but not give your whole life story Your CV will be assessed in seconds, rather than minutes so brevity really is key Bullet points with verbs first will: allow your reader to quickly scan your CV (employers don‚Äôt read CVs, they scan them) (Richards 2019a) highlight your key activities avoid long sections of prose (which the reader will probably skip anyway) 7.4 Is it a bug or a feature? Wherever criticism of your CV comes from, don‚Äôt take it personally - it is probably one of the first you have written. Think of your current CV as an alpha or beta version that you continuously test, release and redeploy. There are many chances to debug and improve your CV during your study but before potential employers read it. The aim of this chapter is to help you improve your CV, whatever stage you are at. Employers often grumble that Computer Science graduates lack written communication skills. Written applications and CV‚Äôs are a common example of this. EDUCATION: Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) degree classification clear? Have you mentioned things you are studying now, not just courses you have finished? See Education STYLE: Does it look good, decent layout, appropriate use of LaTeX or Word or whatever? Are there any spelling mistakes, typos and grammar? Don‚Äôt just rely on a spellchecker, some typos can only be spitted spotted by a human reader LENGTH: Does it fit comfortably on (ideally) one page (for a R√©sum√©) or two pages (for a CV)? See length STRUCTURE: Is the structure sensible? Is it in reverse chronological order? Most important (usually recent) things first? Not too many sections or anything missing? See structuring VERBS FIRST: Have you talked about what you have actually done using prominent verbs first in bullets, rather than just what you think you know? Avoid long sections of prose. RESULTS: Have you also demonstrated and quantified the outcomes of your actions where possible, see Context, Action &amp; Result (CAR) 7.5 Structure your CV How you structure your CV will depend on who you are and what your story is. Recruiters at Google suggest five sections, that follow a header section. Before we look at those, lets look at some general points about CVs, watch the videos shown in Figure 7.3. Figure 7.3: Recruiters at Google, Jeremy Ong and Lizi Lopez outline some tips and advice for creating your resume. (Ong and Lopez 2019) As Jonathan Black, director of the careers service at the University of Oxford has pointed out,(Black 2019b) a key part of your story that you want to communicate in your CV is that you : take responsibility achieve things are nice to have around How can you demonstrate this? Watch the short video in Figure 7.4. Figure 7.4: Jonathan Black, head of the careers service at the University of Oxford, explains how to create a top notch CV by replacing meaningless assertions with meaningful evidence. (Black 2019b) 7.5.1 Your header The first thing in your CV is the header, a simple section giving your name, email, phone number and any links shown in the CV in Figure 7.5 for Alan Turing. That‚Äôs it! Figure 7.5: Keep the header of your CV simple. Just your name, email phone number and any relevant links are all you really need. Anything else, will just waste space and distract the reader. Your header doesn‚Äôt need to include any more information than your name, email, phone and any links. This means your birth date, marital status, photo and home address aren‚Äôt relevant and you don‚Äôt need to give multiple phone numbers or emails either, just one of each will do. If an employer wants to invite you to an interview, they‚Äôll get in touch by email, phone (or possibly LinkedIn) so other contact details are irrelevant at this point. After your header I suggest you have five sections that cover the following: Education: the formal stuff üéì Experience: paid work üí∞ Projects: side, social or University projects üí™ Activities and leadership üëë Awards and honours üèÜ Let‚Äôs look at each of these sections: 7.5.2 Your education Unless you have significant amount of experience, the education section of your CV is likely to be the first real section, after the header. Your education section needs to strike a balance between: Describing in enough detail what you‚Äôve studied and any projects you‚Äôve completed at University as part of your formal education Keeping it short and sweet, without getting bogged down in the details. You‚Äôve invested a significant amount of time and money in getting your degree. At this stage, your degree justifies more description than a terse one line ‚ÄúBSc Computer Science.‚Äù You‚Äôll need to say more than Pen Tester and Rick Urshion (for example) but not as much as Mike Rokernel, who has given way too much information on his degree. You don‚Äôt need to name every single module and give a mark for each. Neither do you need to give two decimal places (it happens). Pick out relevant modules, or the ones you got most out of. Employers like Google encourage applicants to emphasise courses on data structures and algorithms, but you‚Äôll need to tailor your description to the role and be brief. On a one page CV, you might only have two or three lines to describe your higher education. 7.5.3 Your experience Experience is where you can talk about any paid or voluntary work experience you have. Don‚Äôt discount casual labour, such as working in retail or hospitality, these demonstrate your work ethic and ability to deal with customers, often under pressure. You are more than just a techie, so anywhere you‚Äôve worked in a team is experience worth mentioning, even if that team was just two people. Two people is still a team. Figure 7.6: Are you experienced? What have you done? sketch by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND If you don‚Äôt have much experience, don‚Äôt worry, there are plenty of opportunities to get some. For details, see are you experienced? 7.5.4 Your projects The word ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù is a powerful catch-all description for capturing all other things you get up to. These might include: personal side projects social responsibility projects entrepreneurial projects University projects They will most likely be unpaid because paid work fits better in your experience. Perhaps you‚Äôve completed some courses outside of your education such as a massive open online course (MOOC) or similar. Hackathons and competitions, fit well here too. (Fogarty 2015) You don‚Äôt need to have won any prizes or awards, although be sure to mention them if you have. Participating in hackathons and competitions clearly shows the reader that you enjoy learning new things. Demonstrating an appetite for new knowledge and skills will make your application stand out. If you‚Äôre looking for some inspiration for side projects, Dani Stefanovic‚Äôs build-your-own-x repository is a good starting point. Building and creating new things is a great way to understand them, just ask Richard Feynman. 7.7 Figure 7.7: Richard Feynman once chalked ‚ÄúWhat I cannot create, I do not understand‚Äù on his blackboard at the California Institute of Technology while teaching the The Feynman Lectures on Physics. (Way 2017) Creating things in personal side projects is a great way to build new knowledge and help your CV stand out like a sore thumb üëç. Public domain image via Dani Stefanovic github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x Another good source of projects is to fix a bug in an open source project. It might sound trivial, but fixing a bug demonstrates that you can collaborate with others, understand the toolchain being used (which might be complex) and solve problems. If you‚Äôve done group projects at University, be sure to mention them. Try to be more descriptive than this: ‚ÄúFirst year team project‚Äù ‚ÄúSecond year team project‚Äù ‚ÄúFinal year project‚Äù Those project names are pretty opaque and don‚Äôt give the reader much to go on. What was the context, action and result (CAR) of the project? How many people were in your team? How long did you collaborate for? What did you build? What was it called? What did it do? What roles and responsibilities did you have in the team? Was their conflict in the team? How did you resolve it? How did you motivate the free-riders in the team to contribute? This is all excellent CV fodder! It‚Äôs often a good idea to describe what YOU did before you describe what the software, hardware or project did. e.g. reversing the order of this list emphasises what YOU did, rather than what the SOFTWARE did WidgetWasher is a web service that takes random widgets and washes them before painting them a random colour and returning them to the client Tested WidgetWasher on a range of different operating systems and devices Designed and implemented the API which was built using a RESTful approach while pair programming with one other collaborator for two days at a hackathon Your reader is likely to be more interested in what YOU did, rather than what the software (or hardware) that you built did. So in this example, I‚Äôd start with the verbs designed, implemented, tested before saying what WidgetWasher 7.5.5 Your skills? You may be tempted to dedicate a whole section on your CV to skills, particularly the technical ones. Maybe it makes you feel good listing them all in one place like a stamp collection. Don‚Äôt do it! Why not? Let‚Äôs imagine, that like Rick Urshion, you include Python in a long list skills, with its own dedicated section. There are at least four problems with Rick‚Äôs not so skilful approach: No context to give the reader an idea of the where he‚Äôs developed or used his Python skills. Was it during his education, as a part of his work experience or his personal projects? We don‚Äôt know because he doesn‚Äôt say. No actions or evidence to back up his claims of having skill with Python. So Rick claims he knows Python. So what? What did he do with those python skills? We don‚Äôt know because he hasn‚Äôt told us. Perhaps he DOES have Python skills, perhaps he DOESN‚ÄôT. Is he telling lies and peddling fake news? It‚Äôs difficult to tell. No results given for what the outcome of using the skills was. Did he save his employers some money? Did he make something more efficient? Did he learn some methodology? We will never know. No tailoring the skill to the job that he‚Äôs applying for. Python would be valuable if he was applying to be a data scientist, software engineer, or automated tester but perhaps less relevant for a business analysis, consultancy, user experience or project management roles No story told for that skill. This makes for a very dull and boring read. Yawn. Next! So, this doesn‚Äôt mean Rick shouldn‚Äôt mention his Python skills. He needs to give us the context, action and result (CAR). This will make his pythonic story much more convincing and interesting to read. Giving the CAR will improve his chances of being invited to interview. This applies to soft skills too, not just hard technical skills. Best to mention the context in which you‚Äôve used any skills you mention on your CV. So, if you‚Äôre going to have a skill section: keep it short (one or two lines maybe) but don‚Äôt dedicate a whole section to it stick to your strongest and most relevant skills that you are comfortable to answer questions on in your interview Microsoft Office is not generally a very interesting skill because everyone has it. Don‚Äôt waste space talking about it unless you‚Äôve done something very advanced with it, like some complicated integration with other software. If you‚Äôre a computer scientist, you also have demonstrable ‚Äúmeta‚Äù skills like the ability to learn things quickly. You can also think logically, reason, problem solve, analyse, generalise, criticise, decompose and abstract - often to tight deadlines. These computational thinking skills are future-proof and will last longer than whatever technology happens to be fashionable right now. Employers are often more interested in these ‚Äúmeta‚Äù capabilities and your potential than in any specific technical skills you may or may not have. 7.6 Birds eye view Having looked at the sections you‚Äôre likely to have, we‚Äôll take a birds eye view of your whole CV. The issues in this section apply to the whole of your CV, rather than individual sections. 7.6.1 Your style Making your CV look good can take ages, but a well presented CV will stand out. While its worth making an effort to style carefully and consisistenly, you need to be be wary of the huge time sink of typography. Figure 7.8: Does your CV need a little work? The truth is your CV is never finished, you will be continuously developing, debugging and releasing it throughout your life. It‚Äôs such a crucial document because it will determine if you are interviewed, so its important to spend time getting it right. CV work sketch by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND Whatever your typographical style is, portable document format (PDF) is the safest way to deliver it. It‚Äôs called portable for a reason. While Microsoft Word is fine for editing, it is difficult to ensure that a Word document doesn‚Äôt get mangled by transmission via the web or email. PDF is much safer, you can be more confident that it will work well on a range of different operating systems and devices. Try opening a Word document on any smartphone or tablet and you‚Äôll see what I mean. It helps if you can give the file a descriptive name so ada_lovelace.pdf is a better filename than my_cv.pdf It‚Äôs fine to author your CV in Microsoft Word, but you‚Äôll want to save as PDF to make it more platform independent. LaTeX and overleaf can be used to create professional PDFs and have many templates, see Getting started with LaTeX: LaTeX4year1 if you‚Äôve not used LaTeX before. (Hull 2020) 7.6.2 Your context, action and result story One way to structure descriptions of items within each section of your CV is to use Context, Action and Result (CAR) sometimes called STAR (Situation Task Action Result) to tell your stories. This method can also be useful for structuring answers to interview questions, especially if you get nervous. So for example, rather than just listing Python as a skill, you should tell the reader (really spell it out) more about the context in which you‚Äôve used python, what you actually did with it and what the result was CONTEXT: So you‚Äôve used Python, but in what context? As part of your education? For a personal project? As a volunteer? In a competition? ACTION: What did you do with Python? Did you use some particular library? Did you integrate or model something? RESULT: What was the result and how can you measure it? You picked up some knew skills? You made something that was inefficient and awkward into something better, cheaper or faster? Similar to CAR and STAR, recruiters at Google (see Figure 7.3) advise candidates to describe things using ‚ÄúAccomplished [X], as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]‚Äù So instead of saying ‚Äúgenerated reports for end users.‚Äù - You could say ‚ÄúGenerated daily reconciliation report for team by automating workflow of 8 different tasks‚Äù The second is better because its more specific, captures the result (accomplishment), by quantifying it ( ‚Äúas measured by‚Äù) and talks about the actions (the doing part). 7.6.3 Your length How long should your CV be? Many people start with a two page CV, which is a sensible starting point shown in figure 7.9. It is also advisable to create a one page Resume. (David 2017) Figure 7.9: How long should your CV be? Should you write a two page European style CV or an American style resume (one pager)? At this stage in your career you should be able to fit everything on to one page. It can be challenging squeezing it all on: ‚ÄúIf I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.‚Äù ‚ÄîAnon It takes more time to write less. Writing a one page resume is a valuable exercise, because it forces you to distill and edit out any filler or fluff, which you sometimes find on two page undergraduate or graduate CVs. It is much better to have a strong one-page resume than a weaker two-page CV that is padded out with filler to make up the space, as described in the video in figure 7.9. Adding more features (pages and content) to your CV doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it better. Sometimes adding more features to your CV will make it worse, as shown in figure 7.10. Figure 7.10: If it ain‚Äôt broke it doesn‚Äôt have enough features yet. Adding more features to software doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it better. Likewise, adding more pages and content to your CV or resume won‚Äôt always improve it. It‚Äôs often better to be precise and concise, rather than bloated and potentially more buggy. An engineering state of mind by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND If you‚Äôre struggling to fit all the information onto a one page resume, revisit each section and item carefully. Is there anything you can drop? Can you save a wasteful word here, or a lazy line there? Check for any spurious line breaks because every pixel counts. Don‚Äôt throw your two page CV away, its a good store of stuff you might want to add to customised one-page resumes. 7.6.4 Verbs first A simple but effective technique for emphasising what you have done, rather than just what you know, is to start the description of it with a verb. Employers don‚Äôt just want to know what you know, but what you have actually done. So, for example, instead of saying e.g. ‚ÄúIn my second year CS29328 software engineering module I used Java, Eclipse and JUnit to test and build an open source Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) you could say: ‚ÄúBuilt and tested a large open-source codebase using Eclipse, Ant, JUnit and Jenkins ‚Ä¶‚Äù followed by: ‚ÄúAdded and deployed new features to a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) in Java‚Ä¶‚Äù The latter examples get to the point much quicker and avoid the problem of using ‚ÄúI, me, my‚Äù too much which can sound self-centred and egotistical. Although your CV is all about you so it is natural to have a few personal pronouns in there, but too many can look clumsy and give the wrong impression. 7.6.5 Your links Augmenting your CV with web links (hyperlinks) adds context, without adding too many words or taking up valuable space as shown in figure 7.11 Figure 7.11: Adding links is a good way to augment your CV. If you‚Äôre adding LinkedIn, make sure you customise your public profile URL, to remove the default random alphanumeric string at the end, like the 038b37 example here. (Hoffman 2020) You can also remove any ugly http::, forward slashes // and www in URLs which are distracting noise. Neither do you need to waste valuable space telling people what the link is, like in the first example, the domain name already tells you its a LinkedIn profile. Links are also a great way to add evidence and substantiate any claims that you make. They allow your reader to read between the lines and make inferences from the information you‚Äôve provided them with. For example, you might says things like: ‚ÄúBuilt a thing‚Äù reading between the lines: ‚ÄúI like building things. Look at this thing I built just for fun, its really cool‚Äù ‚ÄúJoined an organisation called bla‚Äù reading between the lines: ‚ÄúI was part a bigger thing you might not have heard about but you can find out about here‚Äù ‚ÄúCompeted this event called bla‚Äù reading between the lines: ‚ÄúI really enjoy learning from other people by going to hackathons‚Äù etc Links are crucial features of your CV and an interested reader may even follow them. Treat links with respect and they will support your goals and help your readers. Invest some time thinking about how you word the link text, and how they would be understood out of context. Make sure that: hyperlinks are readable and descriptive (Richards 2019b) hyperlinks are clickable in the PDF. Don‚Äôt make your reader cut and paste (or even type) URLs, they are too busy. If they are clickable, people are much more likely to follow them hyperlinks are paper-proof. Some people still print CVs so the phrase ‚Äúclick here‚Äù won‚Äôt work well on printed paper. See to print or not to print ‚Äî a CV, that is (Garone 2014) Besides LinkedIn you could include public profiles from github, stackoverflow, (Hamedy 2019) devpost, hackerrank. You can also link to personal projects or your blog if you have one. Obviously, you need to be careful about what you link to and what employers can find out about you online. They will Google you. So keep it professional. 7.6.6 Robot proofing your CV It‚Äôs a good idea get feedback from as many different sources as you can on your CV. By sources I don‚Äôt just mean humans, but also robots. Larger employers will use automated Application Tracking Systems (ATS) to log and trace your application. These ‚Äúresume robots‚Äù (if you like) are unlikely to have arms and legs like the one in Figure 7.12, but they will be looking for keywords and standard headings in your CV. You can get automated feedback from a range of different robotic systems, though it is a good idea to remove any personal information like phone numbers etc before using these free services. You might also want to check what the services privacy policy says about what they do with you personal data. Resume robots include: careerset.io, a free service provided by a UK based company, careerset Ltd. resume.io, a free service provided by a Dutch company, Imkey BV jobscan.co, a free service provided by an American company Figure 7.12: Although they often struggle to get up the stairs, resume robots are likely to play an important role in any decisions to invite you to a job interview, especially if you‚Äôre applying to bigger companies. Make sure your CV is resume robot friendly by feeding it through a robot . Machines by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND Besides providing feedback on the content of your CV, using these systems can help address issues such as the use of tables or layout which may cause problems for some systems. For example, some systems ignore the second column of a two-column CV because they can‚Äôt identify it. Some things to check with automated CV screens: Have you used standard headings for the sections? Non-standard sections maybe ignored or misunderstood Have you used appropriate verbs to describe your actions? Is your layout and design robot friendly? 7.6.7 Your references You might be tempted to put your referees details on your resume. Don‚Äôt bother because; references waste valuable space. You can say much more interesting things about yourself than who you referees are references aren‚Äôt needed in the early stages of a job application. They are typically taken up much later, when you‚Äôve been offered or are about to be offered the job references give personal information out. Do you really want to be giving personal details out to anyone that reads your CV? It could easily be misused. It‚Äôs not even worth saying ‚Äúreferences available on request‚Äù - that just wastes space as well and is implied information on every CV anyway. 7.7 Breakpoints Some breakpoints for discussion: How long should your CV be? Should you have a personal statement on your CV? One column or two column layout? Should I put education or experience first? How many of my hobbies and personal interests should I list? How many employers actually read cover letters? 7.8 Big Bad Buglist A quick check-list of commons bugs Has it been reviewed by several people? Have you reviewed other people‚Äôs CV‚Äôs? Does the style look good? Is there too much or too little whitespace? Is there anything irrelevant on there? e.g. personal information, swimming certificates from ten years ago Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) degree classification clear? Are there any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors? Is it in reverse chronological order? Have you used too many personal pronouns? Have you made it clear what you have actually done using prominent verbs? Have you mentioned courses you are studying now (or next semester)? Is it targeted to an employer or job description? Is it balanced, with all non-technical Does it have a good, clear structure? Typically education, experience, projects etc Have you distinguished between paid and unpaid or voluntary work? 7.9 Covering letters &amp; personal statements Applications and CV‚Äôs are often accompanied by covering letters or include some kind of personal statement. Whereas a lot of your CV is essentially a bulleted list of facts and statements, a covering letter or personal statement gives you a chance to really demonstrate your fluent written communication skills in clear prose. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre applying for a widget engineering position at BigWidget Inc. There are three things you need to cover in approximately this order Why them? Why are you applying to BigWidget Inc. Why that role? BigWidget Inc. employees have many roles and responsibilities, so what is it about widget engineering that attracts you? Why you? Why should they employ you? What makes you stand out from all the other widget engineering candidates? What is your Unique Selling Point (USP) or points? 7.9.1 Does anyone actually READ covering letters? Some employers will read them very carefully, some less so. It‚Äôs not clear which employers will bother and which won‚Äôt. Even if nobody reads your covering letter, it is still worth writing one because it forces you to rehearse standard interview questions shown above. See e.g. www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/cl/ for further information. Think of it as practicing your elevator pitch. 7.10 Debugging summary Too long, didn‚Äôt read (TL;DR)? Here‚Äôs a summary: This chapter we‚Äôve looked at how to debug your CV. It‚Äôs important to try and squash any of the bugs we‚Äôve described here, before an employer see‚Äôs your CV.

This chapter looks at job searching and networking. Yes but‚Ä¶ sketch by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND 8.1 What you will learn At the end of this chapter you will be able to: Formulate job search strategies, by role, by sector and location Describe the timing of recruitment cycles used by employers Identify opportunities for finding work, online and face-to-face Identify people in your existing networks who can help you Grow your networks and use them to your advantage Apply your search strategies to advertised (and unadvertised) opportunities 8.2 Where can you for look for jobs? The marketplace for job searching and job hunting advice is incredibly crowded. Employers spend huge amounts of money recruiting staff and this is reflected in the enormous range of job websites, which are often accompanied by advice on job hunting. I‚Äôve broken resources down here into three categories: 8.2.1 Student and graduate specific resources These resources are specifically aimed at undergraduate students and graduates: gradcracker.com for engineering and technology students, you can filter e.g. by Computing/Technology jobs, from the publishers of the popular gradcracker toolkit ratemyplacement.co.uk is a leading UK job resource for undergraduates seeking placements and internships. targetjobs.co.uk graduate jobs, schemes and internships from the people behind The Guardian 300 top graduate employers milkround.com, placements and graduate positions from the people behind The Times Top 100 Graduate employers graduateland.com, placements and graduate positions around Europe prospects.ac.uk, a jobs board accompanied by job searching advice InsideCareers.co.uk is good if you‚Äôre looking for jobs in the financial sector varsitycareershub.co.uk, targeting students from Loxbridge but many of the employers recruit much more widely Year in Industry if you‚Äôre looking for a year in industry Your University careers service, e.g. if you‚Äôre studying at the University of Manchester it‚Äôs careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk. University jobs boards are good places to look for opportunities that are specifically targeted at the University where you are studying 8.2.2 More general resources These resources are aimed at a wider audience (not just students and graduates) but are useful nonetheless. Google job search aggregates content from many (but not all) of the sources listed above. You can use google job search use to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven‚Äôt used it already try the searches below. Unlike other sites, Google job search works by indexing embedded microdata based on schema.org/JobPosting. Keywords like job, intern and placement in an regular google search will trigger the job search product: -google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester -google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern -google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer -google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london -google.com/search?q=data+scientist+placement -If you‚Äôre looking for a job AT google, they have moved from jobs.google.com to careers.google.com LinkedIn advertises job vacancies, is frequently visited by recruiters and you can often apply for jobs directly on LinkedIn (athough making fast applications is not always a good thing). See university.linkedin.com/linkedin-for-students and linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students glassdoor.co.uk is like tripadvisor for jobs. Find out what it‚Äôs really like to work for given employers from current and former employees. A student oriented version can be found at glassdoor.com/Students, this means you can use it without writing a review of a previous employer (which is what non-student users have to do to access the content) HiPEAC jobs (High Performance and Embedded Architecture and Compilation) is good for jobs in hardware, supercomputing and related fields Indeed.co.uk, adzuna.co.uk, cwjobs.co.uk, fish4.co.uk, reed.co.uk, totaljobs.com, monster.co.uk, jobs.smartrecruiters.com, workinstartups.com, cv-library.co.uk, jobs.ac.uk are general jobs boards that also advertise jobs for students and graduates, alongside many other vacancies. stackoverflow.com/jobs jobs via StackOverflow. You‚Äôve cut and pasted the code‚Ä¶ they advertise technical vacancies too Otta.com for people with 0-10 years experience. From engineering to sales, discover jobs &amp; internships at London's most innovative companies. 8.3 Job search strategies It is a good idea to have a range of different strategies for job hunting, and change the strategy during the year. Before we look at strategies, it‚Äôs important to realise that when you‚Äôre reading job descriptions for vacancies, some employers will over state their requirements in the hope they get their dream candidate. You might look at the job description and think, I‚Äôve only got 70% of what they‚Äôre asking for, so I won‚Äôt bother applying. The truth is, if you‚Äôve got 75% of what they are asking for, you should definitely apply. 8.3.1 Over specified job descriptions Employers and recruiters routinely over-specify job descriptions. A good example of this is, when the Swift programming language was released in 2014 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in California, job adverts instantly appeared asking for programmers with 5 years experience in Swift! How can anyone have five years experience in a programming language that‚Äôs only just been made public?! Aside from the people who developed the language, like Chris Lattner, the recruiters and employers are going to have long search trying to find their unicorn. It will probably take them at least five years! ü¶Ñ Job requirements: pic.twitter.com/4QB1oPyxU0&mdash; Mubeen (@Mubeeen_) July 28, 2020 The moral of the Apple story above is, if you don‚Äôt meet all the criteria on a job spec, that shouldn‚Äôt stop you applying. Most job specifications are over-specified as wishful employers dream up their ideal candidate. At the beginning of the academic year in September you might target large multinational organisations. If you‚Äôre not successful, you can switch to smaller employers later in the academic year. Table 8.1 shows summarises some of the when and where some employers advertise. Table 8.1: Where, when and how to apply for vacancies, internships, placements, graduate jobs and schemes in large multinational corporations and small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) Large corporations SMEs Where Advertise broadly Less likely to advertise on big jobs boards When Vacancies earlier in the academic year Vacancies tend to be later in the academic year Type Unlikely to consider speculative applications May consider speculative or informal applications How Multistage applications, several rounds of interviews Shorter application processes 8.4 Breakpoints Take a pause and check the values of your parameters and variables. Here are some breakpoints for reflection and discussion: How many jobs should you apply for? Why is it important to build your network? How can recruiters help you? Whose side are recruiters on, yours or somebody else? How long does it take to apply for a job? Should I optimise for quality or quantity of job applications? How can you deal with the inevitable rejections that come during job hunting? 8.5 The power of weak ties Your close network probably won‚Äôt change that much, the friends and family you trust and rely on. Its important to recognise the importance of more casual acquaintances, or what sociologist Mark Granovetter calls ‚Äúweak ties.‚Äù (Granovetter 1973) Figure 8.2: It‚Äôs not what you know, its who you know. Networking is an essential part of any job search, your networks can help you now and in the future. One of the things looked at in this chapter is how to build and use your networks to help find the job you‚Äôre after. The simplest networking technique is bumping into people, but you need create opportunities for that to happen. Bumped into sketch by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND Weak ties are people you don‚Äôt know as well, but are important for a range of reasons. Research has shown that building networks of weak ties is good for your mental health and can give you an edge in job hunting. (Leslie 2020) Granovetter showed that many job opportunities came through weak ties, rather than strong ones. This is true not just of jobs early on in your career (like now) but also later too. So it is in your interests to continually foster weak connections and be open to serendipitous meetings where you bump into people, as in Figure 8.2. ‚ÄúBumping into‚Äù here, could mean either physical or virtual. Figure 8.3: Who is in your network? Grow and use your network, both the strong ties and the weak ties. Weak ties are often the most important when it comes to job hunting. Networks sketch by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND 8.6 Summarising search Too long, didn‚Äôt read (TL;DR)?

It might be a telephone, video or face-to-face, or it might even be as part of an assessment centre where you‚Äôll be asked to complete several other tasks and tests. Being invited to an interview means that your CV, along with any accompanying covering letters, application forms or digital portfolios, have hit the target. All that reading and writing has paid off. BULLSEYE! üéØ Figure 9.1: If you have got an interview, then you have proved that your CV is bug free.

One of your goals is to convince the interviewers that you can articulate yourself clearly, and communicate well using spoken natural language, while listening carefully to questions that they ask. Remember this is part of fundamental skill we talked about in communication I/O If you‚Äôve got an interview, you can feel good about having a bug-free CV shown in Figure 9.1. But now you have a new set of problems. How can you prepare for the interview? What kinds of interviews exist and what questions might you be asked? If they offer you a job, how will you negotiate the terms, conditions and salary? Do you really want the job anyway and are they the kind of people you actually want to work with everyday? You‚Äôll be giving this employer: most of the hours of your day most of the days of your week most of the weeks of your year something like the next two years of your life (Black 2017) as the first part of you 80,000 hours So you want to ensure employers are a good match and not going to waste your time. 9.1 What you will learn By the end of this chapter you will be able to: Identify kinds of interviews you might be invited to Anticipate common interview questions, technical and non-technical Prepare questions for your interviewer by researching the employer Formulate strategies for negotiating job offers Calm your interview nerves 9.2 Interviews Broadly speaking there are two basic kinds of interviews technical or coding interview non-technical interview, sometimes called competency based interview or HR interview (human resources) These can be conducted in various modes: 9.2.1 Modes of interview Interviews can be conducted in various modes: Figure 9.2: Remember to do the mute / unmute toggle dance if you have a teleconference interview on zoom or similar.

Here are some common competency interview questions. Imagine you are going on a stage, prepare lines that answer these questions, rehearse them out loud in front of a mirror (or a critical friend). What roles can you play in a team? Tell me about a time when you showed integrity and professionalism Can you give an example of a situation where you solved a problem in a creative way? Tell me about a big decision you‚Äôve made recently. How did you go about it? Give an example of a time you handled conflict in the workplace How do you maintain healthy working relationships with your colleagues? Describe a project where you had to use different leadership styles to reach your goal Give me an example of a challenge you faced and tell me how you overcame it How do you influence people in a situation with conflicting agendas?

For more exam * google.com/search?q=competency+based+interview+questions * careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/interviews Since there‚Äôs already tonnes of information The rest of this chapter will focus on technical interviews, also known as coding interviews. 9.2.3 Coding interviews There are a lots of resources to help you prepare for and practice coding interview questions, the best place to start is Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmaan McDowell. (McDowell 2015) As well as reading Gayle‚Äôs book, there are lots of online resources to help you prepare for coding interviews. Before we look at those, University of Manchester Computer Science graduate Petia Davidova explains in figure 9.3 what she learned from failing several coding interviews at big technology companies. üò≠ Figure 9.3: My worst software engineering interview fails, failing my Facebook and Google Interviews by Petia Davidova. Petia demonstrates her growth mindset and productive failure. Although she failed her interviews, she learned lots from the process and went on to get a job she wanted. Coding interviews can be tough, but preparing for them, and doing them will make you a better engineer. So if you spectacularly wipeout in your coding interview, reflect and think how can you improve next time? Perhaps you need to Read up on some more data structures Familiarise yourself with more algorithms Practice thinking out loud (verbally) by doing a mock technical interview? All of these things will help both your general professional development and your chances of success in future technical interviews. 9.2.4 Project Euler Project Euler provides a wide range of challenges in computer science and mathematics. The challenges typically involve solving a mathematical formula or equation, see projecteuler.net 9.2.5 Hacker Rank Hacker rank allows developers to practice their coding skills, prepare for interviews and get hired. HackerRank allows users to submit applications and apply to jobs by solving company-sponsored coding challenges. Hacker Rank provide a discussion and leaderboard for every challenge, and most challenges come with an editorial that explains more about the challenge, see hackerrank.com 9.2.6 Topcoder TopCoder is a platform for competitive programming online. You can complete on your own directly online using their code editor.

In it‚Äôs own words the ICPC is: an algorithmic programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. (Hacker 2021) ICPC is organised by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), a global organisation which advances computing as a science and a profession. There are subregional contests for ICPC, so in the UK there is the United Kingdom and Ireland Programming Competition (UKIEPC) which is part of the Northwestern Europe European Regional Contest (NWERC). UKIEPC has been held annually since 2013 to help universities pick teams to travel to NWERC. Ask your University if they are involved, see ukiepc.info. If they aren‚Äôt involved yet, you could encourage them to join. It‚Äôs not just about winning, it‚Äôs also about taking part. 9.3 Breakpoints You should find out as much as you can about your potential employer before the interview. Here are some breakpoints, pause your program and check these parameters and variables: What the main products and services that the organisation provides? Who are their clients or customers? Who are their biggest competitors? What sector do they principally operate in? Who are the market leaders in that sector? How is the sector changing, for example how is technology having an impact on their business? 9.4 Summarising interviews Too long, didn‚Äôt read (TL;DR)? Here‚Äôs a summary: We‚Äôve looked at a range of platforms and competitions that can help you prepare for coding interviews.

This chapter on your alternatives will broaden your horizons and get you to think about some of the less obvious options, because I love weird edge cases and you should too. üòª Figure 10.1: Are you a weird edge case? By default, graduates typically choose a graduate scheme with big brand, often a blue-chip multinational employer. While working for these kind of employers has many benefits, they are not the whole story. This chapter looks at some of the alternatives. Default user by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND Many technology jobs exist outside of technology companies, (Assay 2020) because a lot of software is written to be used rather than sold. Consequently, many employers create bespoke software to fit their own business needs. The people who build are often employees that given organisation, rather than people employed by a technology company. In the United States for example, ninety percent of IT jobs are outside the traditional tech industry. Technical jobs outside the technology sector often have the advantage of being more accessible than those within a very competitive technology sector. (Markow, Coutinho, and Bundy 2019) 10.1 What you will learn Describe the less obvious careers that computer science can lead to, besides software engineering 10.2 With great code comes great responsibility Computer scientists wield tremendous power in the twenty first century: With great power comes great responsibility (Parker 1962) With great code comes great responsibility (Goldman and Schlesinger 2018) Given the growing power of computing in the twenty-first century, computer scientists have a duty to society to use that power responsibly and justly.

If you‚Äôre on a fixed term contract, such as a summer internship or year long placement, they‚Äôll make you a job offer during or soon after your contract of employment expires. If you‚Äôre on a more permanent contract, such as a graduate job or graduate scheme you‚Äôll be promoted and given more responsibility. üí™ You‚Äôre doing really well if you can impress your manager. Some lucky people make it into this category. 11.2.3 Dive It will go badly, you will struggle to fit in and won‚Äôt meet the expectations of your employer. Once you were star-crossed lovers, but now the relationship has turned tragically sour. (Shakespeare 1597; Goble and Wroe 2004) There are several ways that you might breakup with (or be dumped by) your newly estranged lover. üíî If things get really bad, your employer may take disciplinary action against you (UK 2020a) and in the worst case scenario, you‚Äôll be fired (dismissed). (UK 2020c) Alternatively, you might decide to you want to hand in your notice to terminate your contract of employment and leave. (UK 2020d) Dismissal is rare, but it does happen, even to interns and placement students. In this scenario in the UK, the employer has a duty to do everything they reasonably can to prevent this from happening. It‚Äôs not your employers interests to fire you because they‚Äôve invested a lot of time and money in you by this point. If they have sensible recruitment procedures, those procedures will root out unsuitable candidates long before they make it to the workplace where they can cause real and lasting damage to the organisation once in post. 11.3 Placement visits During your placement you will be visited by an academic member of staff who will meet with you and your manager at the same time.[^If you want to meet with your academic tutor without your manager being around, please let your tutor know] The visit is a good opportunity to reflect on what progress you have made during the year alongside areas you need to improve. You will probably already have had similar meetings with your manager or managers, for examples as part of your personal development review (or whatever your employer calls performance reviews). There are three basic questions your tutor will ask you: What have you been doing? WWW: What Went Well? EBI: Even Better If? 11.3.1 What have you been doing? Briefly describe your roles and responsibilities during your placement to date. What projects have you worked on? What were the main technologies that you used? 11.3.2 WWW: What went well? Are there any projects you are particularly proud of? What new knowledge or skills have your learnt or improved? Remember to include both non-technical as well as technical aspects of your job. Non-technical skills include organisation, time-management, confidence, communication etc. 11.3.3 EBI: Even Better If? What areas have you identified for improvement in the future? Again, this includes non-technical as well as technical skills. 11.3.4 Managers comments Your tutor will ask your manager to ask the same questions. Are there any differences between your view and your managers view of your placement? If so, why do you differ? 11.3.5 Placement report Both your tutor and you need to fill in the placement report, no more than two pages.

(Bourne 2005) Over a decade more than 1000 rules were published in over 100 articles in the scientific journal PLOS Computational Biology. (Bourne et al. 2018) These articles offer a huge range of advice from making the most of a summer internship (Aicher et al. 2017) to teaching programming (Brown and Wilson 2018) and even winning a Nobel Prize. (Roberts 2015) Articles as lists, or ‚Äúlisticles‚Äù as they are sometimes known, are a convenient way to summarise key points. So here are Ten Simple Rules for Coding Your Future: the too long, didn‚Äôt read (TL;DR) for this guidebook. Figure 13.1: Ten Simple rules for coding your future. Know who you are, look after yourself, use what you have, grow your networks, always make new mistakes, help and thank, look beyond the obvious, stay in school, step outside your comfort zone and (most importantly) don‚Äôt give up! Figure by Visual Thinkery is licensed under CC-BY-ND 13.1 Know who you are There is a lot more to you than your degree. Yes, you‚Äôve spent three or four years getting your degree. identify your weaknesses and work out how to improve them. 13.2 Look after yourself Look after yourself mentally and physically. Choose your reference points carefully, try not to compare yourself to the person at the top of the class. Ask yourself, am I doing better than last time? 13.3 Use what you have This rule is borrowed from software engineer Greg Wilson @gvwilson, who probably adapted it from a quote frequently misattributed to President Theodore Roosevelt (Brewton 2014). The full quote is Start where you are, use what you have, help who you can, see https://third-bit.com 13.4 Build your network Build your network, use all the people you can. Remember that the weaker ties in your network may be more important than your stronger ties, especially when it comes to finding jobs. It‚Äôs not what you know, its who you know. 13.5 Always make new mistakes You can classify your mistakes and failures into two categories: Productive mistakes: those you learnt from Unproductive mistakes: those you didn‚Äôt learn anything from and risk repeating Mistakes and failure are inevitable in life, but productive mistakes are going to help you much more that unproductive ones (Petroski 1992). That doesn‚Äôt just mean you should ‚Äúfail fast, fail often‚Äù (Babineaux 2013) or ‚Äúmove fast and break things,‚Äù but to conciously learn from any mistakes you make so that you don‚Äôt repeat them. One way to turn unproductive mistakes into productive ones is deliberately and conciously reflect on why you made them. This is part of the growth mindset we discussed in the chapter on your well-being. In a growth mindset, mistakes can be good, but the fear of making them is not. You are more likely to take more chances when you‚Äôre unafraid to fail, and this will improve your chances of success. Many education systems around the world don‚Äôt teach people how to fail, because they put too much emphasis on success (top grades) rather than progress and learning. (Lahey 2016) So as Ester Dyson says, Always make new mistakes If you‚Äôve got some harsh feedback on your CV, how can you make less buggy in the future? If you‚Äôve applied to lots of companies and not even had a reply yet, how you improve your job search strategy? If you‚Äôve neglected to develop interests and projects outside of work, how can you rebalance? If you crashed and burned in an interview, how can you use the experience to do better next time? If you failed to get the promotion you thought you deserved, what will you do differently in the future 13.6 Help and thank who you can There are good reasons to be grateful, showing gratitude doesn‚Äôt just help other people, it helps you too. Join a team by helping someone, be a team player, help others, thank others for their help. 13.7 Look beyond the obvious Be flexible in approach. Not just big employers, there are startups, SME‚Äôs you‚Äôve never heard of. It‚Äôs not just London, and other big cities. Look beyond graduate schemes, look beyond graduate jobs. You are not just a techie, Either. 13.8 Stay in school Never stop learning. 13.9 Step outside your comfort zone Am I being insensitive asking people to step outside their comfort zone when we‚Äôve all be stretched beyond breaking point during COVID-19? We‚Äôre going to need to continue to step outside of our respective comfort zones in order to meet the challenges we face around the world. This takes courage, but that‚Äôs often when you learn most. So step outside your comfort zone if you‚Äôre feeling brave enough to learn. 13.10 Don‚Äôt give up Learn to live with rejection, don‚Äôt take it personally 13.11 Ten simple summaries This chapter is under construction, but hopefully you can get the general gist of what‚Äôs going on.

So a simple way to improve your job prospects is to broaden and deepen your job search and consider all the alternatives, geographically and otherwise. For example, if you‚Äôre seeking work or further study in the United Kingdom, there are lots of possibilities in Loxbridge (London, Oxford and Cambridge). While Loxbridge undoubtedly offers many fantastic opportunities for professional growth and development, it does not represent all of the best opportunities that exist in the UK. So, it‚Äôs wrong to assume that capital cities like London are where all the best opportunities are. That‚Äôs true in the UK and also in many other countries too. You might need to consider moving your future. Figure 15.1: Like many capital cities, London dominates the economy of its country. There are clearly some fantastic employers offering great opportunities in London but they do not represent everything that is on offer in the UK. There are plenty of good career options outside of capital cities like London if you don‚Äôt want to live and work in a huge metropolis. Not just London Image by Sharon Dale (Dale 2018) This is a partial list of employers in the North West of England (aka the Northern Powerhouse) that recruit Computer Science students. This is not a comprehensive list of all tech companies in the North West, but will give you a quick flavour of employers in the Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Northern England. 15.1 Hit the North, Not Just London You don‚Äôt have to move to London to find top employers, there are plenty located here in the North West if you‚Äôd like to stick around after you graduate and Hit the North. (Smith, Smith, and Rogers 1987) Northerners have often argued that Northern England offers a better quality of life than London we couldn‚Äôt possibly comment other than to say its horses for courses. The North West Tech Community calendar, provides a window on (and networking opportunities with) many of employers based in the North West technw.uk if you want to find out more. To quote sharon dale, its NotJustLondon (Dale 2018) The list of employers in this page is currently being migrated from git.io/manc, visit that page for a list of employers from the North West. 15.2 techUK and technation.io In addition to these techuk.org and technation.io provide more information on technology businesses outside of London. 15.3 Guest lectures from employers The Department of Computer Science welcomes external speakers and hosts a number of guest lectures from a wide range of collaborators in industry and academia. There are several ways the department can host guest lectures Scheduled lectures for COMP101, a first year course with 400+ enrolled students. During 2021, these talks take place on Mondays from midday to 12.50pm on zoom School research seminars , see examples of past seminars Technical talks arranged as part of a scheduled course, speak to the course leader for the relevant course. These tend to be more advanced courses aimed at students later in their degrees or as part of postgraduate study. One-off talks arranged ad hoc that are not part of scheduled series of lectures Seminars and talks from speakers arranged and booked by students, for example unicsmcr.com, The University of Manchester Computer Science society 15.3.1 Examples of COMP101 lectures Some example guest lectures for COMP101 are shown below to give a flavour of the kind of talks that are appropriate Hacking the Hacks, delivered by NCC Group Debunking the myths associated with User Experience, delivered by American Express The Business of Intellectual Property, delivered by Imagination Technology) How to Break a Hacker‚Äôs Mind, Web Application Vulnerabilities Exposed, delivered by Morgan Stanley 100 billion ARM chips, delivered by ARM Software at Airbus Computing in the Community, delivered by CodeClub &amp; Manchester Girl Geeks How to be a brilliant software engineer, delivered by Apadmi 15.3.2 Interested in speaking? For COMP101, we are always looking for good speakers who can engage large groups of students on interesting topics that they care about and relate to Computer Science. For COMP101, there are a limited number of guest lecture slots (around 20) which run through term-time starting in November and finishing in early June. Its important that speakers Give much more than a sales pitch for an organisation, by providing insight into a technical subject Talk about content that relates to the (very broad) syllabus of COMP101 Engage, interact, educate and entertain. Students vote with their feet (by not turning up) if they think a lecture won‚Äôt be interesting If you would like to propose a guest lecture for COMP101, please contact Duncan Hull. For all other external seminars and events, see the links above. Since lockdown, lectures have been online, which has allowed for more interaction, typically via the chat dialogue. We can monitor and moderate the chat, feeding questions to the speaker when it‚Äôs appropriate.

I would normally expect participants in small meetings (not large ones like lectures) to turn their cameras on but I understand that there are good reasons why people may not be willing/able to and won‚Äôt explicitly ask you to. 18.2.1 Why turn cameras on? There has always been a question around whether to turn cameras on during online meetings but it is even more obvious with online meetings becoming the norm rather than the exception. I see a direct benefit in using cameras in small, personal meetings where many of us make use of visual cues to aid the flow of conversation ‚Äì at the very least it‚Äôs easier to identify who is talking. Additionally, it can help people get along ‚Äì people might feel more ‚Äòlistened to‚Äô if they can see somebody listening and personally I find it easier to remember names etc if I have a face to match the names to. I will generally have my camera on and will continue to keep it on even if I am the only one. 18.2.2 Why not? There are lots of reasons why not. Most obviously, if you don‚Äôt have access to a camera. But you may also be in an environment which you prefer others not to see, you may have anxiety around the issue, or your connection might be too slow. There are many other perfectly reasonable reasons for you not to put your camera on and you should not feel pressured to do this. If you simply say ‚ÄúSorry, I can‚Äôt turn my camera on today‚Äù then I won‚Äôt ask any further and I will never explicitly ask you to turn it on. 18.2.3 Being appropriate You should already be treating online meetings like physical ones e.g. turning up on time, being prepared, listening, engaging etc. Similarly, if people can see you then you should ensure you are wearing appropriate clothes (wearing clothes is the absolute minimum here!) and in an appropriate place (the bathroom is probably not appropriate) as you would for a physical meeting. 18.2.4 Respecting others If other people have decided to turn their cameras on then I ask that you show them respect by not recording anything without explicit permission. I won‚Äôt touch on the legality of this as I believe that basic respect for each other should be enough to prevent any issues. You will take part in larger meetings where recording may be standard and in such cases this should be made explicit.
