<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Writing as a soft social skill<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#softwrite"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Your soft social skills will take a <strong>life time</strong> to develop and are <strong>really hard</strong> use. Why? Because soft skills are about <em>communicating</em> with and <em>understanding</em> other people so that you can work <em>together</em> as a team toward a shared goal. Your soft skills are hard. There are very few jobs where you work on your own in complete isolation. For example, most software and hardware is designed, built, tested and used by teams of people. Many of these teams are large and have very diverse membership. This means that sooner or later you’re going to have to master the dark arts of <em>working with other people</em> by developing and deploying your softer skills. One of those softer skills you’ll need to continuously develop is written communication.</p>
<p>Communicating with other people and working in teams is inherently difficult because we’re all human. There is good news and bad news…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>THE GOOD NEWS</strong> is, people can be diligent, humble, competent, honest, caring and reliable. They can be co-operative, generous, supportive, kind, thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive, understanding, punctual and professional too!</li>
<li>
<strong>THE BAD NEWS</strong> is, unfortunately people can also be lazy, stupid, ignorant, vain, incompetent, dishonest, unreliable, greedy, egomaniacal, unpredictable and moody. They can be proud, selfish, competitive, lustful, angry, envious, mean, busy, insensitive and thoughtless too. Some will disagree with you, boss you around, betray, exploit, misunderstand and mislead you, deliberately or otherwise. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-sevendeadly" role="doc-biblioref">Goble 2007</a>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This <em>shouldn’t</em> be news to you but it means communicating with and understanding other people can be hard work, but don’t worry, <strong>everyone</strong> finds this challenging, it’s not just you! It doesn’t matter if you’re an extrovert or an introvert, communication is a challenge for everybody, and everyone can get better at it too. This chapter takes a look at the softer skill of written communication and techniques you can use to improve your writing. Whatever mood your readers are in, they’ll find it a lot easier to work with you when you can express yourself clearly in writing.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Computing is your superpower!<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#superpower"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Studying computer science gives you an awesome superpower. We will look at some of the reasons why in chapter <a href="computing.html#computing">6</a> on <em>Computing your Future</em>. But for now, let us just acknowledge that hard technical skills like computing are highly sought after and valuable, both commercially and otherwise.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</div>

<p>Your computational superpower is less powerful if it isn’t complemented by a broad range of softer skills. Typically, these skills are not closely examined in most computer science degrees, by repeated assessment. This not because soft skills aren’t important but because they are hard to measure accurately.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to know how good you are at understanding the syntax and semantics of a programming language like Python, there are tried and tested techniques for doing this. However, if I want to know how good you are at using your communication skills to work in a team, negotiate, lead, resolve conflicts, persuade others, show empathy etc that’s <strong>much</strong> harder to measure accurately.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some of low-level communication skills (I/O) that they are built on.</p>

<p>In terms of input and output, your fundamental communication skills are listening, speaking, reading and writing words in natural languages shown in table <a href="writing.html#tab:iotable">4.1</a>. These are the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly languages</a>” of human communication. This might sound blindingly obvious, but these skills are often under-estimated or undervalued by engineers and scientists, especially undergraduates. Alongside verbal and written communication, there’s also nonverbal language, or body language such as eye contact, gestures and facial expressions.</p>
<div class="inline-table"><table class="table table-sm">

<p>Some engineers and scientists leave plenty of room for improvement when it comes to the communication skills outlined in table <a href="writing.html#tab:iotable">4.1</a>. Think of your stereotypical scientist, clad in a white coat, unable to explain the complexities of their subject to people inside their lab, let alone outside of it. Then there is the nerdy software engineer stereotype who prefers the company of computers to people. Yes, these are lazy and sometimes unhelpful stereotypes, but they express public perception of scientists and engineers as poor communicators. Don’t perpetuate the stereotype by being a bad communicator.</p>

<p>The art of communication is a huge subject which extends far beyond the scope of this guidebook. So for the rest of this chapter, we’ll focus on your superpower of written communication.

<p>Written communication skills are important because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Good writing and reading are crucial in applications</strong> for employment and further study. From writing CV’s, covering letters, completing application forms and reading job specifications, and employer (or course) information, your ability to read and write natural languages is crucial to coding your future.</li>
<li>
<strong>Writing often gets neglected</strong>: Written communication skills (both reading and writing) are sometimes sidelined in science and engineering degrees. This is particularly true in the “hard sciences.” For example, communicating and solving problems using code or mathematics are usually the dominant forms of assessment in computer science courses. That’s understandable given the subject, but tends to push natural languages (like english) to the sidelines.</li>
<li>
<strong>Good engineers are also good writers</strong> Many engineers (and scientists) could significantly improve their written communication skills. Software engineers are notoriously bad at writing, see for example <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/960492.960525">Why Computer Science Students Need Language</a>, <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-Beaubouef2003" role="doc-biblioref">Beaubouef 2003</a>)</span> <em>Scientists Must Write</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-scientistsmustwrite" role="doc-biblioref">Barrass 2002</a>)</span> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-real-reason-silicon-valley-coders-write-bad-software/263377/">The Real Reason Silicon Valley Coders Write Bad Software</a>, <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-writebadsoftware" role="doc-biblioref">Meisler 2012</a>)</span> just three examples amongst many others making exactly the same point. Employers like Google provide training (and a whole career path) for technical writers, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/tech-writing">developers.google.com/tech-writing</a>. I’m glad they exist, but these careers and courses wouldn’t be needed if software engineers were better at documenting, explaining and communicating with other human beings in the first place!</li>
<li>
<strong>Writing good english is like writing good code</strong>. Some of the skills you already have in coding can be transferred to written communication. Just like a good <code>function</code>, <code>class</code> or <code>method</code> in code should be well-defined with a clear purpose, your writing should also be clear and coherent. Well structured writing is a lot like well architected software too, with a clear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a> (SoC)</li>
<li>
<strong>It is relatively easy to improve</strong> your written communication skills, simply by reading and writing more. Reading and writing deliberately every day, will significantly improve these skills. See the rest of this chapter for some simple exercises to get started with and:

<p>What do they all have in common? They’re all written in natural languages like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English language</a>, but without them, the software or hardware they describe and discuss would be useless. Using written (and spoken) natural language is a key social skill and a communication skill. You might be using your language to persuade, convince or argue with members of your team. So it is important that you do it to the best of your abilities.

<p>Making software isn’t all about what you can do as an individual but rather how you communicate with and contribute to your team. It’s easy to get carried away with your ego. Remember that most jobs require <em>lots</em> of softer people skills and collaboration, written communication is a huge part of that, see for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ">The Myth of the Genius Programmer</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-Fitzpatrick" role="doc-biblioref">Fitzpatrick and Collins-Sussman 2009</a>)</span></p>

<p>Dogfooding is a simple technique for testing your own writing. Let’s say you’ve just written a personal statement or covering letter (see section <a href="debugging.html#we3qs">7.10</a>). It’s natural to read it over in your head to check for errors, before you send it. However, <strong>reading it aloud</strong> will pick up errors you may not have spotted by reading silently. There’s something about articulating words out loud that flushes out errors you don’t pick up when you read them in your head. Dogfooding is a tried and tested technique. It also means you’re ready to vocalise those answers in an interview.</p>
<p>You might want to choose carefully where you do this as it might look a bit strange, but it works well. If you talk into a mobile phone while looking at a piece of paper, people won’t notice you’re talking to yourself. But you’ll probably need some privacy as the stuff you’re talking about is likely to be personal. Alternatively, find a critical friend who you can read out loud to.</p>

<p>Another technique for improving your written communication is to write something every day, that might be a personal diary that only you read, or it could be something more public like blog. Schedule a time every day, say 15 to 30 minutes when you will do this without fail. That writing could take several forms:</p>

In *The Clean Coder* [@cleancoder], he defines a professional as someone who is accountable and responsible, not just taking responsibility for what they build but being responsible for their own career. Being a professional relies on both soft and hard skills.-->
<!--Employers often talk about skills gaps, skills crises [@oilandgaskills; @mindthegap] and labour shortages of various kinds.

However, while hard technical skills are important for your future, your soft skills are just as likely to get you hired, promoted or even fired.
