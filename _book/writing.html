<p>We all have strengths and weaknesses, and for students of Computer Science, it is sometimes their communication skills that let them down. Other chapters in this guidebook discuss the fundamental communication skills of <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/speaking">speaking</a>, <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/hearing">listening</a> and <a href="https://www.cdyf.me/reading">reading</a>. This chapter looks at <em>written</em> communication because:</p>
<ul>
<li>every <em>engineer</em> is also a writer, and good engineers have good written communication skills</li>
<li>every <em>scientist</em> is also a writer, and good scientists also have good written communication skills too</li>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Writing as a soft social skill<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#softwrite"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Your soft social skills will take a <strong>life time</strong> to develop and are <strong>really hard</strong> use. Why? Because soft skills are about <em>communicating</em> with and <em>understanding</em> other people so that you can work <em>together</em> as a team toward a shared goal. Despite their name, soft skills are hard.</p>
<p>There are very few jobs where you work on your own in complete isolation. For example, most software and hardware is designed, built, tested and used by teams of people. Many of these teams are large and have very diverse membership. This means that sooner or later you’re going to have to master the dark arts of <em>working with other people</em> by developing and deploying your softer skills. One of those softer skills you’ll need to continuously develop is written communication.</p>
<p>Communicating with other people and working in teams is inherently difficult because we’re all human. There is good news and bad news…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>THE GOOD NEWS</strong> is, people can be diligent, humble, competent, honest, caring and reliable. They can be co-operative, generous, supportive, kind, thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive, understanding, punctual and professional too!</li>
<li>
<strong>THE BAD NEWS</strong> is, unfortunately people can also be lazy, stupid, ignorant, vain, incompetent, dishonest, unreliable, greedy, egomaniacal, unpredictable and moody. They can be proud, selfish, competitive, lustful, angry, envious, mean, busy, insensitive and thoughtless too. Some will disagree with you, boss you around, betray, exploit, misunderstand and mislead you, deliberately or otherwise. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-sevendeadly">Goble 2007</a>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This <em>shouldn’t</em> be news to you but it means communicating with and understanding other people can be hard work, but don’t worry, <strong>everyone</strong> finds this challenging, it’s not just you! It doesn’t matter if you’re an extrovert or an introvert, communication is a challenge for everybody, and everyone can get better at it too. It’s easy to undervalue the importance of communication because we use it everyday. Just as humanities students are sometimes guilty of being ignorant of science, your average science and engineering student is often guilty of underestimating the importance of the humanities, language and culture, as shown in figure <a href="writing#fig:cpsnow-fig">4.2</a>.</p>

<p>It probably doesn’t help that in the UK, and several other countries, many students specialise early in their education by choosing between:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>EITHER</strong> a predominantly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics">science, technology, engineering, and mathematics</a> (STEM) pathway</li>
<li>
<strong>OR</strong> an “artier” and allegedly more “creative” humanities pathway <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-notcreatives">Cole 2017</a>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Are C.P. Snow’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures">two (seperate) cultures of humanities and science</a> still living in seperate houses like an estranged and bickering couple? Would he judge the gaps between the two cultures to have closed or been widened in the sixty years since he described them? <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-twocultures">Snow 1959</a>)</span> This is debateable but in the worst case scenario, two cultures in society produces:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>science and engineering graduates who are technically strong but have weaker communication skills, both written and spoken, combined with cultural ignorance, political indifference, general illiteracy and other inhumanities</li>
<li>humanities graduates who are articulate, well read, vocal, persuasive and write clearly but sometimes lack technical skills. In extreme cases, they can be scientificially and mathematically illiterate</li>
</ol>
<p>Are you in the first category? This chapter takes a look at the softer skill of written communication and techniques you can use to improve your writing. Whatever mood your readers are in, they’ll find it a lot easier to work with you when you can express yourself clearly in writing.</p>

</h2>
<p>Studying computer science gives you an <em>awesome</em> superpower. We will look at some of the reasons why in chapter <a href="computing#computing">7</a> on <em>Computing your Future</em>. But for now, let us just acknowledge that hard technical skills in computing are highly sought after and valuable, both commercially and otherwise.</p>

<img src="images/Achilles-Heel-to-Superpower.png" alt="Computing is a superpower that Gods like Hermes and mortal heroes like Achilles would probably have envied. (Fry 2018, 2017) As a technical or hard skill, computing is a crucial weapon in your armoury but what are your weaker skills? What is your Achilles’ heel? For some scientists and engineers, their weakness is their soft skills, such as communication.

<p>Your computational superpower is less powerful if it isn’t complemented by a broad range of softer skills. Typically, these skills are not closely examined in most computer science degrees, for example by repeated assessment. There’s an awful lot of <a href="https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations">technical computing curriculum</a> that tends to have a higher priority over soft skills. It’s not that soft skills aren’t important but that they can be hard to quantify.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to know how good you are at understanding the syntax and semantics of a programming language like Python, there are tried and tested techniques for measuring this. However, if I want to know how good you are at using your communication skills to work in a team of engineers to negotiate, lead, resolve conflicts, persuade others, show empathy etc that’s <strong>much</strong> harder to measure accurately. What technical degrees tend to measure is technical skills because softer skills, shown in figure <a href="writing#fig:allskills-fig">4.4</a>, are much harder to assess by examination and coursework.</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons that you are much more than your grades, see figure <a href="achieving#fig:more-than-grades-fig">19.3</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of input and output, your fundamental communication skills are listening, speaking, reading and writing words in natural languages shown in table <a href="writing#tab:iotable">4.1</a>. These are the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly languages</a>” of human communication. This might sound blindingly obvious, but these skills are often under-estimated or undervalued by engineers and scientists, especially undergraduates. Alongside verbal and written communication, there’s also nonverbal language, or body language such as eye contact, gestures and facial expressions.</p>

<p>Some people leave plenty of room for improvement when it comes to the communication skills outlined in table <a href="writing#tab:iotable">4.1</a>. Think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the stereotypical mad scientist, clad in a white coat, unable to explain the complexities of their research to people inside their lab, let alone outside of it, see figure <a href="writing#fig:madscientist-fig">4.5</a>
</li>
<li>the nerdy software engineer stereotype who prefers the company of computers to people</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, these are lazy tropes and unhelpful stereotypes, but they express public perception of scientists and engineers as poor communicators. Don’t perpetuate the stereotype by being a bad communicator.</p>

<p>Written communication skills are important because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Good writing and reading are crucial in applications</strong> for employment and further study. From writing CV’s, covering letters, completing application forms and reading job specifications, and employer (or course) information, your ability to read and write in natural languages is crucial to coding your future.</li>
<li>
<strong>Writing often gets neglected</strong>: Written communication skills (both reading and writing) are sometimes sidelined in science and engineering degrees. This is particularly true in the “hard sciences”. For example, communicating and solving problems using code or mathematics are usually the dominant forms of assessment in computer science courses. That’s understandable given the subject, but tends to push natural languages (like english) to the sidelines.</li>
<li>
<strong>Good engineers are also good writers</strong> Many engineers (and scientists) could significantly improve their written communication skills. Software engineers are notoriously bad at writing, see for example <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/960492.960525">Why Computer Science Students Need Language</a>, <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-Beaubouef2003">Beaubouef 2003</a>)</span> <em>Scientists Must Write</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-scientistsmustwrite">Barrass 2002</a>)</span> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-real-reason-silicon-valley-coders-write-bad-software/263377/">The Real Reason Silicon Valley Coders Write Bad Software</a>, <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-writebadsoftware">Meisler 2012</a>)</span> just three examples amongst many others making exactly the same point. Employers like Google provide training (and a whole career path) for technical writers, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/tech-writing">developers.google.com/tech-writing</a>. I’m glad they exist, but these careers and courses wouldn’t be needed if software engineers were better at documenting, explaining and communicating with other human beings in the first place!</li>
<li>
<strong>Writing good english is like writing good code</strong>. Some of the skills you already have in coding can be transferred to written communication. Just like a good <code>function</code>, <code>class</code> or <code>method</code> in code should be well-defined with a clear purpose, your writing should also be clear and coherent. Well structured writing is a lot like well architected software too, with a clear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a> (SoC)</li>
<li>
<strong>It is relatively easy to improve</strong> your written communication skills, simply by reading and writing more. Reading and writing deliberately every day, will significantly improve these skills. See the rest of this chapter for some simple exercises to get started with and:

<p>What do they all have in common? They’re all written in natural languages like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English language</a>, but without them, the software or hardware they describe and discuss would be useless. Using written (and spoken) natural language is a key social skill and a communication skill. You might be using your language to influence, persuade, convince or argue with members of your team. So it is important that you do it to the best of your abilities. Computer Scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_von_Ahn">Luis von Ahn</a>, shown in figure <a href="writing#fig:vonahn-fig">4.8</a>, is the creator of <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">duolingo.com</a>. Luis regrets that he didn’t spend any effort developing his social skills early in his career. Instead, like many computer scientists he focussed his effort on his mathematical and technical skills instead. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-vonahn">Shaw 2021</a>)</span></p>

<p>Making software isn’t all about what you can do as an individual but rather how you communicate with and contribute to your team. It’s easy to get carried away with your ego. Remember that most jobs require <em>lots</em> of softer people skills and collaboration, written communication is a huge part of that, alongside spoken communication see for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ">The Myth of the Genius Programmer</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-Fitzpatrick">B.

<p>Writing has multiple uses, or to use a programming analogy, it is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading">overloaded function</a>. We need to examine some of these different functions, because they are easily overlooked and taken for granted, especially by engineers and scientists. We read, write and rewrite everyday without stopping to give it much thought. If you don’t like writing, you need to learn to love it because it’s actually your friend. Not just any friend, but your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_friends_forever">Best Friend Forever</a> (BFF), see figure <a href="writing#fig:bff-fig">4.9</a>.</p>

<p>So let’s expand on each of the reasons in figure <a href="writing#fig:bff-fig">4.9</a> why writing is your new BFF:</p>

<p>Writing is communication, see figure <a href="writing#fig:comms-fig">4.10</a>. Well Duh! I’m stating the obvious, because you will sometimes hear software engineers talking disparagingly about writing the (<em>sigh</em>)<code>documentation</code>.</p>

<p>Engineers may sometimes tell you that writing about their software or hardware can be a chore. If they bother to write about their software at all, they often do it at the end, <em>if</em> there is time and there’s no more features to be added or bugs to be removed. This might go some way to explaining why software and hardware documentation can be so bad because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is probably written as an afterthought or in a hurry</li>
<li>It might not be authored by the person who actually designed or built the software</li>
<li>The documentation may be describing complex processes or very abstract concepts</li>
<li>It may have been mangled with the original meaning lost in translation to a different (natural) language</li>
<li>The author may lack empathy with their readers<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Unfortunatley this is very common in Computing!&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A good example of this is the documentation for the distributed version control system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a>. While <code>git</code> is a powerful tool that is worth spending time learning about, like most powerful tools, it is also quite complicated. Some of the documentation on git is very good <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-progit">Chacon and Straub 2014</a>)</span> but other parts of it tend towards impenetrable jargon-ridden nonsense. Take this example selected by <a href="https://github.com/spderosso">Santiago Perez De Rosso</a> from the documentation describing a command known as <code>git-wave-stash</code> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-youtube-git">Rosso 2017</a>)</span></p>
<blockquote>
wave all staged stashes next to various cherry-picked non-applied applied trees
<footer>
— Anon <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-sigman07">Rosso and Jackson 2016</a>)</span>
</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you work out what that actually means? Me neither. No doubt, you can think of many other examples where you’ve been reading documentation and thought <code>WTF</code>? This is just one example from many that shows why good writing is crucial for communication.</p>
<p>Badly written text like the example above, fails to communicate with the reader. We’ve all been on the receiving end of badly written prose, especially when it comes to software and hardware documentation. When it is done well, writing quickly communicates what readers actually need to understand.</p>

<p>What were you doing on the March 6th 2013? You probably don’t know and I’ll bet you would probably struggle to find out. I don’t know what I was doing on March 6th 2013 either because I have no written records for that day. If I was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder">obsessive–compulsive diarist</a> (OCD), I’d have a written record of what happened to me on that day.

<p>If it <em>might</em> be important, it is <em>probably</em> worth writing down. Even things you think are trivial are still worth writing down as they might turn out to be important later:</p>

</li>
<li>Lecture notes you’ve written</li>
<li>A bug you’ve been working on including how you fixed it</li>
</ul>
<!--https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1554456645530435588--><p>So besides communicating, writing records what happened. If you don’t write it down, it might just disappear forever without trace. The audience you’ll be communicating with isn’t just other people, it might be your future self. That future self might <em>really</em> need to know how you fixed that bug, and it could save you <em>hours</em> of re-figuring out how to solve a problem you’ve already solved.</p>

<p>You say you want a revolution? Well, you know, we all want to change the world. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-revolution">Lennon and McCartney 1968</a>)</span> Whatever kind of revolution you want to start or join, you’ll stand a much better chance of making it happen, if you write down your ideas in a way that people can clearly understand. This might include mini-revolutions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting a job interview, by crafting a persuasive covering letter and compellng CV</li>
<li>Encouraging people to join <code>projects</code> you’ve started, see section <a href="debugging#projects">8.6.4</a>
</li>
<li>Negotiating terms and conditions of a contract of employment, you might start by email</li>
<li>Getting someone to invest in your startup or offer you some freelance or contract work</li>
<li>… and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>So writing well won’t just help you communicate and record, it will help you to become a more successful leader too by specifying exactly what you mean so you can convince other people to follow your lead.</p>

<p>Your brain tends to work <em>much</em> more quickly than your fingers can type or your hands can write. Your brain will often work much faster than you can speak as well.

<p>Writing forces you to say more <em>exactly</em> what you are thinking. Slowly. Whereas thoughts can be fast, vague and slippery, writing needs to be much more precise and accurate.

<p>Ever got stuck on a difficult problem? Ever tried writing that problem down or articulating the details to a rubber duck? There’s something about writing a problem down or articulating the issue to another person. Even a rubber duck will do, see figure <a href="writing#fig:rubber-duck-fig">4.15</a>.

<p>When you are writing a CV, résumé or a covering letter, the <em>product</em> of your writing is the most important output. But sometimes, it is the <em>process</em> of writing that matters more than the product, see figure <a href="writing#fig:process-fig">4.16</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some examples where the process of writing can be more important than its product:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking notes helps you concentrate on what a speaker is saying</li>
<li>Writing a reflection which forces you to analyse on what has happened and what you’ll do next, see section <a href="starting#reflecting">18.6</a>. Cognitive psychologists call this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition">metacognition</a>, thinking about thinking</li>
<li>Writing down a problem helps you to solve it, as described in section <a href="writing#solving">4.5.5</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So writing is important as a <em>process</em> as well as a <em>product</em>. That process might include slowing down (section <a href="writing#slowing">4.5.4</a>), speeding up (section <a href="writing#accelerating">4.5.8</a>) or both. Either way, writing forces you to be clear and focus, it is a <em>process</em> for working, not just the <em>product</em> (output) of working. When you write a dissertation or thesis for your bachelors or masters degree the process of writing is as important as the product. The computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Peyton_Jones">Simon Peyton Jones</a> outlines how recognising this can help you to write a better dissertation or thesis in figure <a href="writing#fig:peyton-jones-vid">4.17</a>.</p>

Figure 4.17: Computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Peyton_Jones">Simon Peyton Jones</a> explains how to write a better dissertation or thesis by writing early and often, rather than waiting to write it all at the end. He’s talking about writing papers here, but what he says applies to writing a thesis too: Writing helps you be clear by crystallizing what you understand. It’s important as a <em>process</em> as well as a product.

<p>As well as slowing your brain down discussed in section <a href="writing#slowing">4.5.4</a>, writing can also speed it up by <em>wicking</em> ideas like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_wick">candle wick</a> does for candle wax. Without the wick, the candle wax can’t undergo the chemical reaction that transforms it into carbon dioxide and water. As the software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)">Paul Graham</a> puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
“If I can’t write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets in the way of having the next. Pen and paper wick ideas”
<footer>
— Paul Graham <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-theislandtest">Graham 2006</a>)</span>
</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>and also</p>
<blockquote>
“I think it’s far more important to write well than most people realise. Writing doesn’t just communicate ideas; it generates them. If you’re bad at writing and don’t like to do it, you’ll miss out on most of the ideas writing would have generated”

<p>Dogfooding is a simple technique for testing your own writing. Let’s say you’ve just written a personal statement or covering letter (see section <a href="debugging#covering-letters">8.10</a>). It’s natural to read it over in your head to check for errors, before you send it. However, <strong>reading it aloud</strong> will pick up errors you may not have spotted by reading silently. Your ears and tongue will pick up on awkward phrases and sentences that your eyes didn’t spot. There’s something about articulating words out loud that flushes out errors you don’t pick up when you read them in your head. Dogfooding is a tried and tested technique. It also means you’re ready to vocalise those answers in an interview.</p>
<p>You might want to choose carefully where you do this as it might look a bit strange, but it works well. If you talk into a mobile phone while looking at a piece of paper, people won’t notice you’re talking to yourself. But you’ll probably need some privacy as the stuff you’re talking about is likely to be personal. Alternatively, find a critical friend who you can read out loud to. You can also use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen reader</a>, for example :</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Teams has an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/education/products/learning-tools">immersive reader</a>
</li>
<li>Android devices have <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6007100">TalkBack</a>
</li>
<li>Apple devices have <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph3e2e415f/ios">VoiceOver</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A screen reader will often reveal mistakes you haven’t spotted by reading your text silently.</p>

<p>All of these tools will be biased by whatever data they’ve been trained on and encode some of the prejudices of the engineers that wrote their algorithms. You need to be careful about plagirism (if it is academic work) and writing generic job applications that are de-personalised and de-humanised. Employers will be able to spot these a mile off.</p>
<p>Another problem with using writing machines to help you communicate is that while the more sophisticated software might help overcome some of the dreaded <em>writer’s block</em>, they bypass the important <em>process</em> of writing discussed in section <a href="writing#product">4.5.6</a>. Writing about something is one of the best ways to learn about it, and sometimes the best time to write is when you’re trying to figure out the subject for yourself. If you wait until you’re an expert, it will be too late to start. If you get a machine like ChatGPT to write for you, you won’t identify gaps in your knowledge and develop the expertise to fill them.</p>
<p>So viewing writing as just another kind of <code>output</code>, overlooks a lot of the value of writing in the first place.</p>
<p>Despite their limitations, and the fact that we’re still trying to figure out what their long term impacts will be, writing machines may help you to communicate more clearly and quickly. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-mairead">Pratschke 2023</a>; <a href="reading#ref-noordenai">Stokel-Walker and Noorden 2023</a>; <a href="reading#ref-hutsonai">Hutson 2021</a>)</span></p>

<p>Another technique for improving your written communication is to deliberately write something every day, that might be a personal diary that only you read, or it could be something more public like blog. Schedule a time every day, say 15 to 30 minutes when you will do this without fail. Sometimes this will be easy, other times it will be hard. What’s important is that you write something, see figure <a href="debugging#fig:jodi-picoult-fig">8.5</a>. That writing could take several forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>public web log or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blog</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal">gratitude journal</a> see section <a href="nurturing#lays">3.4</a>

</ul>
<p>The technique of <em>30 minutes per day</em> can be a very effective way of getting things done, incrementally over time. In my experience it works for lots of things besides writing including getting exercise (discussed in chapter <a href="nurturing#nurturing">3</a>) to gardening. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-leendertz">Leendertz 2006</a>)</span></p>

<p>You don’t get good at communicating with computers (coding) by just <em>writing</em> lots of code. You also need to <em>read</em> other people’s code too and be able to understand and modify it. Likewise, you don’t get good at communicating with people by just <em>writing</em> stuff in natural languages like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English language</a>. You need to <em>read</em> stuff too.

In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs. [@googleteams]-->
<!--Professionalism can be defined several ways but [Robert C. Martins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin)'s definition is a good starting point. In *The Clean Coder* [@cleancoder], he defines a professional as someone who is accountable and responsible, not just taking responsibility for what they build but being responsible for their own career. Being a professional relies on both soft and hard skills.-->
<!--Employers often talk about skills gaps, skills crises [@oilandgaskills; @mindthegap] and labour shortages of various kinds. [@digitalskillscrisis; @softskillscrisis; @shadboltreview] They frequently point out that various combinations of skills can be problematic to find and develop in their employees, [@brucetulgan] and even that they fight a “war for talent” [@warfortalent]. As a science and engineering student you get lots of opportunities to develop hard skills. However, while hard technical skills are important for your future, your soft skills are just as likely to get you hired, promoted or even fired. [@nicegirls; @rocketscience; @jonathanblack; @paulredmond; @helpihaveamanager] Soft skills are hard to learn but well worth spending your time and effort to develop.-->

<!--Application of numeracy – manipulation of numbers, general mathematical awareness and its application in practical contexts
(e.g. measuring, weighing, estimating and applying formulae).-->
<!--Application of information technology – basic IT skills, including familiarity with word processing, spreadsheets, file management and use of internet search engines.-->
<!-- Underpinning all these attributes, the key foundation, must be a positive attitude: a ‘can-do’ approach, a readiness to take part and contribute, openness to new ideas and a drive to make these happen.-->

<p>Your future is bright, your future needs writing. Writing your future will help you design your future. Designing your future will help you to start coding your future.</p>
<p>You’ll need both soft and hard skills to compete in the workplace. Are you underestimating the importance of softer skills? We’ve looked briefly at the softer written communication skills in this chapter and some simple techniques for improving them. You can go a step further by enrolling on some humanities courses where you’ll develop your these skills even more.</p>
<p>Written communication skills are only the tip of the soft skills iceberg. Teamwork, negotiation, conflict resolution, public speaking, motivating others and leadership are also important soft skills too. How can you develop these skills while at University? How can you demonstrate to potential employers that you have these skills? Your technical skills are of limited use without people skills, to allow you to work with others see figure <a href="writing#fig:otherpeople-fig">4.26</a>.</p>
