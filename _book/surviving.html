<p>Congratulations, you’ve just accepted an offer of employment. You nailed that interview (or interviews) and you’re just about to embark on the exciting journey from the world of study to the world of employment. This <em>might</em> be your first SERIOUS job, so what do you need to survive? Even better, how can you thrive in your new role and take on the challenges that are coming your way? How will you optimise your trajectory to reach new heights? 🚀</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Survive, thrive or dive?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scenarios"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Starting a new job is a bit like starting a new relationship. You’ve been through the courtship of recruitment, this might have been quick or may have had many rounds of first and second dates. Now you’re both committed to each other and starting the relationship for real. Simply put, there are three scenarios for you as a new employee. You’ll survive, thrive or dive.</p>
<div id="survive" class="section level3" number="11.2.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.2.1</span> Survive<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#survive"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It will go OK, you’ll meet the expectations of your employer and become and valued employee. Most employees fit in to this category. 🆗</p>
</div>
<div id="thrive" class="section level3" number="11.2.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.2.2</span> Thrive<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#thrive"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It will go brilliantly, you’ll exceed the expectations of your employer. If you’re on a fixed term contract, such as a summer internship or year long placement, they’ll make you a job offer during or soon after your contract of employment expires. If you’re on a more permanent contract, such as a graduate job or graduate scheme you’ll be promoted and given more responsibility. 💪</p>
<p>You’re doing really well if you can impress your manager. Some lucky people make it into this category.</p>
</div>
<div id="dive" class="section level3" number="11.2.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.2.3</span> Dive<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dive"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It will go badly, you will struggle to fit in and won’t meet the expectations of your employer. Once you were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-crossed">star-crossed lovers</a>, but the relationship has turned sour and may end in tragedy. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-romeo" role="doc-biblioref">Shakespeare 1597</a>; <a href="reading.html#ref-goblewroe" role="doc-biblioref">Goble and Wroe 2004</a>)</span> There are several relationship problems that could lead to you breaking up with (or being dumped by) your newly estranged lover. 💔</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Grievance</strong> You tried solving a problem or concern informally by talking to your manager but you’re not satisfied with the response and want to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/raise-grievance-at-work">raise a formal grievance complaint in writing</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-grievance" role="doc-biblioref">UK 2021c</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>It’s not you, it’s me</strong> You might ultimately decide to you want to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/handing-in-your-notice">hand in your notice</a> to terminate your contract of employment and leave. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-iquit" role="doc-biblioref">UK 2020b</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>It’s not me, it’s you</strong> If things get really bad, your employer may <a href="https://www.gov.uk/disciplinary-procedures-and-action-at-work">take disciplinary action against you</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-dive" role="doc-biblioref">UK 2021a</a>)</span> and in the worst case scenario, you’ll be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/dismissal">fired (dismissed)</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-yourefired" role="doc-biblioref">UK 2021b</a>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dismissal is rare, but it <strong>does</strong> happen, even to interns and placement students. In this scenario in the UK, the employer has a duty to do everything they reasonably can to prevent this from happening. It’s not your employers interests to fire you because they’ve invested a lot of time and money in you by this point. If they have sensible recruitment procedures, those procedures will root out unsuitable candidates long before they make it to the workplace where they can cause real and lasting damage to the organisation once in post.</p>
<p>All employers have procedures for making sure that your get and can agree on work that suits both of you. Better employers will have better procedures to ensure this happens. Employers don’t want their employees to dive. Both your employer and you do not want this to happen.</p>

<div id="visits" class="section level2" number="11.3">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">11.3</span> Placement visits<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#visits"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>During your placement you will be visited by an academic member of staff who will meet with you and your manager at the same time.[^If you want to meet with your academic tutor without your manager being around, please let your tutor know] The visit is a good opportunity to reflect on what progress you have made during the year alongside areas you need to improve. You will probably already have had similar meetings with your manager or managers, for examples as part of your personal development review (or whatever your employer calls performance reviews). There are three basic questions your tutor will ask you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What have you been doing?</li>
<li>WWW: What Went Well?</li>
<li>EBI: Even Better If?</li>
</ol>
<div id="what-have-you-been-doing" class="section level3" number="11.3.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.3.1</span> What have you been doing?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-have-you-been-doing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Briefly describe your roles and responsibilities during your placement to date. What projects have you worked on? What were the main technologies that you used?</p>
</div>
<div id="www-what-went-well" class="section level3" number="11.3.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.3.2</span> WWW: What went well?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#www-what-went-well"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Are there any projects you are particularly proud of? What new knowledge or skills have your learnt or improved? Remember to include both non-technical as well as technical aspects of your job. Non-technical skills include organisation, time-management, confidence, communication etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="ebi-even-better-if" class="section level3" number="11.3.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.3.3</span> EBI: Even Better If?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ebi-even-better-if"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>What areas have you identified for improvement in the future? Again, this includes non-technical as well as technical skills.</p>
</div>
<div id="managers-comments" class="section level3" number="11.3.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.3.4</span> Managers comments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#managers-comments"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Your tutor will ask your manager to ask the same questions. Are there any differences between your view and your managers view of your placement? If so, why do you differ?</p>
</div>
<div id="placement-report" class="section level3" number="11.3.5">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.3.5</span> Placement report<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#placement-report"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Both your tutor and you need to fill in the placement report, no more than two pages. See the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/industrial-placement-report/vcjymrgmcpzh">industrial placement report template on overleaf</a></p>
