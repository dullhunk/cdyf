<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a student, an employee or even both at the same time. To be successful at studying or working, you need to take your well-being seriously. By well-being, I mean your health and happiness. Your health isn’t just about your physical health but also your mental health and the two are very closely linked. It’s all too easy when you are busy or stressed to neglect your well-being and then <strong>bad-stuff™</strong> happens. This chapter looks at your well-being, and how you can nurture it. Because looking after yourself now will also nurture your future. 😀</p>

<p>One of the main target audiences for this textbook is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">Generation Z</a>, that’s people born sometime between the mid-nineties to early 2000’s. There’s some evidence to suggest that Gen-Z-ers like you have a higher probability than previous generations of being, as <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist">The Economist</a></em> puts it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stressed</li>
<li>Depressed</li>
<li>Exam obsessed</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you stressed? Depressed? Exam obsessed? Have smartphones and social media had a negative effect on your mental health? <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-twenge">Twenge 2017</a>; <a href="reading#ref-destroying">Murdoch 2023</a>)</span> Are you more worried about getting good grades than drinking too much or having unplanned pregnancies? According to <em>The Economist</em> members of Generation Z are more likely to be affected by mental health issues. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-generationz">Economist 2019</a>)</span> If that’s you then you are not alone. Stress, depression and results obsession have been around a while. Many people struggle with them so let’s look at them in a bit more detail.</p>

<p>University is a positive experience for many people, however like Alan, you may also experience periods of stress. This may also be accompanied by anxiety, loneliness and depression. Financial, social and academic pressures alongside concerns about employability, fallout from COVID-19, war, AI taking over the world and climate change (<em>etc</em>) can all have an impact on your wellbeing. Statistically, one in four of us will be affected by mental ill health during our lifetime. Two of the most common forms of mental ill health are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Anxiety</strong>: <em>persistent</em> feelings of unease, such as worry or fear</li>
<li>
<strong>Depression</strong>: a low mood that <em>lasts for a long time</em> and affects your everyday life. Being affected by depression is <strong>not</strong> the same as feeling sad
<!--* loneliness and isolation
* stress, how you feel under pressure-->
<!--Your brain is a complex organ that is not fully understood, so it is not surprising that brains sometimes need treatment when things go wrong.-->
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>persistent</em> and <em>lasting a long time</em> are important here because while its part of the human condition to worry and feel sad, that doesn’t <em>necessarily</em> mean you are affected by poor mental health. How long is a long time? Definitions vary, but around two weeks is a good rule of thumb. There are many forces (<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>) at play, feelings of sadness or anxiousness are normally balanced out by counteracting feelings of calm or happiness shown in figure <a href="nurturing#fig:free-body-fig">3.3</a>:</p>
<!--$F_S_A_D$-->
<ul>
<li>Forces that make you unhappy: <strong><span class="math inline">\(F\)</span><sub>SAD</sub></strong>
</li>
<li>Forces that make you happy: <strong><span class="math inline">\(F\)</span><sub>HAPPY</sub></strong>
</li>
<li>Forces that make you anxious: <strong><span class="math inline">\(F\)</span><sub>ANXIOUS</sub></strong>

<p>Millions of people around the world live with depression. If you are affected by depression it can be really hard to talk about it as there are many social stigmas around mental health. Thankfully depression is largely preventable and treatable. Recognising depression and seeking help is the first and most critical step towards recovery. To mark <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day">World Mental Health Day</a> writer and illustrator Matthew Johnstone tells the story of how he overcame the “black dog of depression” in the video in Figure <a href="nurturing#fig:sad-vid">3.5</a> made in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>

<p>A common issue with poor mental health is that the people affected often don’t realise they need help, partly because of the social stigmas that prevent people talking about mental health in the first place.

<p>Just <em>talking</em> about mental health issues is an important step in removing the social stigmas that surround them. Talk to somebody, anybody about your mental halth, or be that person for somebody else to talk to about theirs.</p>

<p>Looking after yourself can serve to both prevent and treat mental health issues that can affect you in life. You might be your own worst critic, or perhaps when you’re under pressure you neglect things that are proven to be beneficial for your mental health, like sleep, exercise, mindfulness and friendship. Looking after yourself means at least three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>being mindful of your feelings and learning to manage your inner critic</li>
<li>being kind to yourself in various ways</li>
<li>deliberately scheduling protected time to do the non-work things that matter.</li>

<p>Harvard Psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_R._Santos">Laurie Santos</a> describes five evidence-based strategies for coping when times are really challenging and tough in the video in figure <a href="nurturing#fig:laurie-vid">3.11</a>. Those strategies are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Exercise</strong>: getting regular exercise improves both physical AND mental health.</li>
<li>
<strong>Gratitude</strong>: research shows that being grateful can significantly improve your mental health. One way to do this is by keeping a gratitude journal, a log you fill in everyday of things you are grateful for. This can include both the small and big things in life.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sleep</strong>: actively developing healthier sleep patterns. Poor sleep hygiene can be both cause and effect of poor mental health. See the discussion of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Sleep">Why We Sleep</a></em> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-whywesleep">M. Walker 2018</a>)</span> in section <a href="nurturing#signposts3">3.8</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Socialising</strong>: give a higher priority to spending time with friends and family. There is good evidence to show this will make you happier than turning inward or diving deeper into work which could just make you more stressed, depressed or anxious <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-lauranxiety">Marchese 2022</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mindfulness</strong>: be mindful of emotions using the R.A.I.N. technique:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>R</strong>ecognise: negative emotions</li>
<li>
<strong>A</strong>ccept: accept and allow emotions rather than fighting or ignoring them</li>
<li>
<strong>I</strong>nvestigate: notice how the emotion feels inside your body</li>
<li>
<strong>N</strong>urture: be kind to yourself, step away from your emotions by distancing yourself from them.<!--Ruby Wax calls this non-identification which is the same thing-->
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It can help to think of negative emotions as coming from another person, an inner critic, rather than yourself. You are not your emotions and thoughts. Laurie explains the R.A.I.N. technique in figure <a href="nurturing#fig:laurie-vid">3.11</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes a desire to be productive by overworking has exactly the opposite effect, because the sacrifices you make for work can be counter-productive. If you burn too brightly you might burnout completely, see <a href="https://mentalhealth-uk.org/burnout/">mentalhealth-uk.org/burnout</a>. 🔥</p>

<!--## Physical Turing Test {#turingtest}  

Turing took up long-distance running and was good enough to come close to being selected for the English national team and competing in the Olympics.  It is no coincidence that alongside Turing's extraordinary mental capabilities he had good physical health because these abilities complement each other. If you look after your physical health, you will be able to relieve the stresses and anxieties in your life to improve your mental health. You'll also ensure you can perform to the best of your mental abilities while at University and beyond.

<p>Learning at University can be hard because you might have gone from being at (or near) the top of the class in high school to no longer being top of the class at University.</p>
<p>Likewise the job hunting described in chapter <a href="finding#finding">11</a> can take a heavy toll on your mental health because repeated rejection is an ordinary part of the process. It can be time consuming, stressful and demoralising. You may find your applications disappear into a black hole. They will be ghosted (ignored) by employers. Interviewers will blank you and refuse to give you meaningful feedback because they’re too busy. This could happen multiple times. This is all <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/par_for_the_course">par for the course</a></em>, normal and expected, and is not necessarily a reflection on your abilities or potential. See the examples in the coding interview section <a href="speaking#codinginterview">13.2.3</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-youtube-petia">Davidova 2021</a>)</span></p>

<p>Adopting a growth mindset can be a successful strategy for maintaining your wellbeing, see figure <a href="nurturing#fig:fixedminset-fig">3.18</a>. If your grades aren’t has good as you hoped or your search for employment is being met with repeated rejection, a growth mindset can help. Let’s take rejection from potential employers as an example, there are two ways you can react to it:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong><em>Fixed mindset</em></strong>: responding with a fixed mindset will mean you are likely to take rejection personally. You might even assume that this confirms what you’ve always suspected. You’re not good enough or that you made some fatal mistake in your applications or interviews. Ouch.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Growth mindset</em></strong>: by responding to rejection with a growth mindset, you focus on what happens next. Rejection is not failure but a “not yet” described in figure <a href="nurturing#fig:not-vid">3.19</a>. Maybe you’re not yet ready for that employer, but you’ll definitely have a good idea of what you learned from the process and how can you do better next time.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Stanford psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck">Carol Dweck</a> we can all be placed on a spectrum describing where we think our abilities come from. At one end, the fixed mindset assumes all kinds of abilities are fixed traits while at the other end, a growth mindset assumes these abilities can be developed over time. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-dweck">Dweck 2017</a>)</span> There is good evidence that adopting a growth mindset will make you a better learner who can cope with the inevitable failures and rejections in life better. This approach can be used in a range of different disciplines such as learning programming languages <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-Cutts2010">Cutts et al. 2010</a>)</span>, music <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-Davis2016">V.

<p>This chapter has looked at your wellbeing and especially the role that both your mental health and physical health play in your future. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Haig">Matt Haig</a>’s first-hand accounts of poor mental health will be comforting to anyone who is affected by mental ill health. Even if you’re not affected, there is a 25% chance you will be at some point in your life. There’s also a high probability someone close to you will suffer from mental health issues. It might be a colleague, friend, family member, fellow student or partner, so it is worth educating yourself on the issues by reading his two short books:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Notes on a Nervous Planet</em> is a personal account of anxiety <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-nervousplanet">Haig 2019</a>)</span>

<li>
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasons_to_Stay_Alive">Reasons to Stay Alive</a></em> is a personal account of depression <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-stayalive">Haig 2016</a>)</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s good about Matt Haig’s books is they are quick and easy to read, but give plenty of first-hand insight into what mental ill-health can do to people (including you). Matt describes his top five tips for good mental health in figure <a href="nurturing#fig:haig-vid">3.20</a></p>

<p>There’s plenty of evidence that social media can have a detrimental effect on health. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier">Jaron Lanier</a>’s skeptical polemic <em>Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-lanier">Lanier 2018</a>)</span> is a thought-provoking romp through some of the pitfalls of social media that may have you reaching for the delete or un-install button fairly quickly.

<p>If all these books are making you sleepy, neuroscientist Matthew Walker’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Sleep">Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams</a></em> may change your view on the importance of a good nights sleep. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-whywesleep">M.

<p>Finally, it’s well worth taking a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_R._Santos">Laurie Santos</a> course on <em>The Science of Wellbeing</em> (TSOWB) at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being">coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-lauriesantos">Santos 2022b</a>)</span> TSOWB course provides an alternative to medication as it follows the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).</p>
<p>TSOWB is the most popular course at Yale University and looks at some simple techniques you can use to improve your happiness. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-happinessny">Shimer 2018</a>)</span> The course will help you increase your happiness and build more productive habits. Using the latest research, Santos describes the misconceptions about happiness and “annoying features” of your mind that can impair your well-being. The course takes about 19 hours to complete but you can spread this over a whole semester (or longer) if you choose. The short clip in figure <a href="nurturing#fig:laurie-vid">3.11</a> gives you a brief taster of Laurie’s style and work.</p>

<p>Anxiety and depression are serious conditions that are very likely to affect you or somebody close to you while you are at University. There’s a one in four chance that you will be affected by mental health issues at some point in your life.</p>
<p>We’ve only talked about two particular mental health issues, anxiety and depression, but there are many other conditions such as phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, self-harm and more that are beyond the scope of this chapter. They do have one thing in common, and that is that talking about them is an important part of starting to develop better mental health. Mental health can affect everyone, all genders, classes and races.</p>

<p>If you are affected by mental ill health, talking about it is the best place to start, but often the hardest. You can continue by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Accepting yourself for who you are, see chapter <a href="exploring#exploring">2</a>
</li>
<li>Learning to identify and challenge unhelpful thinking patterns</li>
<li>Avoiding the trap of compare yourself to other people too much</li>
</ol>
<p>… are three more steps you can take to help yourself, see figure <a href="nurturing#fig:mindyourhealth-fig">3.22</a>. In this chapter, I’ve outlined some ways you can help yourself alongside some of the services and people you can talk to if you need to.</p>
<p>Despite how you might feel, you are not alone.</p>
