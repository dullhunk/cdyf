That future you is the <em>best possible version of you</em> shown in <a href="knowing.html#fig:goal-fig">2.1</a>.

<p>Your identity, who you are, is:</p>
<ul>
<li>complex</li>
<li>dynamic</li>
<li>high-dimensional</li>
</ul>
<p>… so you need to use different techniques to develop better self-awareness. Your education is a big part of your identity and what you’ve learned from and taught to you peers is a big part of that. Before we look at some techniques for improving your self-awareness, we’ll look at the <em>protected</em> parts of your identity.</p>
<div id="protected" class="section level3" number="2.2.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Your protected characteristics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#protected"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Some of your identity includes characteristics that are protected. In the UK, the Equality Act of 2010<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> protects you from discrimination at work or in education, based on what are known as “protected characteristics”. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-equality" role="doc-biblioref">Servant 2020a</a>)</span>. This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>age</strong> should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>disabilities</strong> should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>gender</strong> should not determine how you are treated <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-inferior" role="doc-biblioref">Saini 2018</a>; <a href="reading.html#ref-damore" role="doc-biblioref">Damore 2017</a>; <a href="reading.html#ref-damoreguardian" role="doc-biblioref">Lewis 2017</a>; <a href="reading.html#ref-everydaysexism" role="doc-biblioref">Bates 2016</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>Your <strong>gender re-assignment</strong> should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>marriage</strong> or civil partnership should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>pregnancy</strong> and maternity should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>race</strong> (including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin) should not determine how you are treated <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-nottalking" role="doc-biblioref">Eddo-Lodge 2017</a>; <a href="reading.html#ref-superior" role="doc-biblioref">Saini 2019</a>)</span>

<li>Your <strong>religion</strong> or beliefs should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>sex</strong> should not determine how you are treated <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-harassment" role="doc-biblioref">Price 2019</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>Your <strong>sexual orientation</strong> should not determine how you are treated <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-nosex" role="doc-biblioref">Britton 2019</a>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are a special part of your identity because they are protected. This means they shouldn’t be a factor in apply for a job or a subject for discussion in a job interview. Let’s look at them in more detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="genderid" class="section level3" number="2.2.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Gender<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#genderid"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Gender is something most people <em>believe</em> they understand, but many people actually don’t. One way to understand gender better is to break it down into four characteristics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Identity</strong>: your gender identity</li>
<li>
<strong>Expression</strong>: your gender expression</li>
<li>
<strong>Sex</strong>: your biological sex</li>
<li>
<strong>Attraction</strong>: your sexual and romantic orientation</li>
</ol>
<p>These protected characteristics are often conflated, because people tend to confuse gender, sex and sexual orientation. They are <em>not</em> the same thing as shown in equation <a href="knowing.html#eq:gender">(2.1)</a></p>
<div class="rmdnote">
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:gender">\[\begin{equation}
Identity ≠ Expression ≠ Sex ≠ Attraction
  \tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Lets have a look at each of those in turn:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Identity</strong> 🧠 is who you know yourself to be in your own head. Gender identity is based on how much you align (or don’t align) with the options for gender based on your psychological sense of self. This includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>
<code>Woman | Genderqueer | Man</code> see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Expression</strong> 🎨 is how you demonstrate your gender based on gender roles through the ways that you act, dress, behave and interact. These are not exclusive categories, you might choose to express yourself in all three ways including:
<ul>
<li>
<code>Feminine | Androgynous | Masculine</code> see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Sex</strong> ⚧️ is often conflated with gender. Sometimes called anatomical sex or physical sex, your biological sex is objectively measurable using features such as your genitalia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome">chromosomes</a> (your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-determination_system">sex-determination system</a> <code>XX</code>, <code>XY</code> etc), hormones, body hair, ovaries and testes. Your biological sex includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>
<code>Female | Intersex | Male</code> see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Attraction</strong> ❤️ is who you are physically, spiritually and emotionally attracted to. Like biological sex, sexual orientation is often conflated with gender but isn’t always a component of gender. We categorise the attraction we experience in gendered ways. Your sexual orientation includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>
<code>Asexual | Heterosexual | Bisexual | Homosexual</code> see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These characteristics are summarised in the genderbread person shown in figure <a href="knowing.html#fig:genderbread-fig">2.3</a></p>

<p>Self-awareness, understanding who you are, is important for leading a healthy and happy life, and likely to be an important factor in your future success. One way to develop better self-awareness is to think about the finer details of your story. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-freeyourstory" role="doc-biblioref">Box and Mocine-McQueen 2019</a>)</span> How did you get here, where are you going, what has inspired you? Who is the authentic you? <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-regrets" role="doc-biblioref">Ware 2011</a>)</span> What are your hopes and dreams? By starting to answer these questions you will gain a better understanding of who you are. This includes strengths, weaknesses, motivation and values. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-parachute2020" role="doc-biblioref">Bolles 2019</a>)</span></p>
<p>Your story is probably complex but you need to know it so you can distill the details of it into <em>much</em> shorter stories on your job applications described in section <a href="debugging.html#mycvst">7.6</a>. Things to think about are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters: who are the key people in your story so far?</li>
<li>Settings: where have your stories taken place?</li>
<li>Action, conflict and change : what has changed you and how?</li>
<li>Emotions: how did you feel at the time, sad, happy, excited?</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the learning outcomes described above are non-trivial. You may have good self-awareness and be able to describe aspects of who you are in a matter of minutes.

<p>If you have privileges, it is important to recognise and acknowledge any advantages these have given you in life. They are a key part of your identity and who you are. If you don’t recognise your privileges then you don’t know yourself. Ask yourself <em>honestly</em>, what privileges do you have? For example, is it <em>just</em> your skills and knowledge that have got you into higher education, or have you been fortunate?</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to think of any privileges, see section <a href="knowing.html#privileged">2.4.4</a> for some suggestions.</p>
<p>Being mindful of any privileges that you have is not just a part of your identity. Being grateful for those privileges is beneficial for your mental health too, see the discussion of section <a href="nurturing.html#lays">3.4</a>.</p>

<p>One of the things you’ll probably want to do is reflect on your life and wonder:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you achieve?</li>
<li>Do you have any regrets, if so what are they?</li>
<li>What would you change if you could carry on living?</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be a useful technique for forcing you to think about who you are and what you value. If you find this activity difficult, see section <a href="knowing.html#regret">2.4.1</a> for some hints. The Roman’s called this <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">Memento mori</a></em> which roughly translates from latin as “remember that you are mortal” or “remember that you have to die” .</p>
<p>Co-founder of <a href="https://desana.io/">desana.io</a> Michael Cockburn argues that you should “make decisions as if you were on your deathbed”. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-cockburn" role="doc-biblioref">Cockburn 2022</a>)</span> Remember that you have to die. <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">Memento mori</a></em>.

<p>This chapter has looked at knowing yourself and who you are. Being self aware, understanding your strengths and weaknesses is key to getting what you need from your future. Questions about your identity are non-trivial, hopefully this chapter has started you thinking about who you are, what motivates you and what you want out of life. You will need to keep revisiting these questions about your identity because some aspects of your identity may change over time.</p>

<p>What do you know and what don’t you know about yourself, see figure <a href="knowing.html#fig:mathers-known-fig">2.12</a>? These fundamental design questions you’ll need to address when you starting building your future. We touched on understanding any privileges you may have as being important for understanding who you are but also in being beneficial for your mental health.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll look at mental health in more detail.</p>

## Exercise: Sail Boat
# SITUATION:

* You are on an island with four other people
* You can see the mainland in the distance
* It is too far to swim there
* There is a sailing boat on the island
* You don’t know how to sail
* You only have enough supplies to survive one day
* Next to the sailing boat are some resources

### Your options

Prioritise the following options by writing a number `1` next to your first choice and number `2` next to your second choice, and so on.

* Discuss only the realistic options available
* Tell everyone how motivated you are to find an answer
* Read the ‘Manual of Sailing Techniques’
* Test that the sailboat is ready and prepared to sail
* Work out the different ways that the sail boat could be used
* Make a full analysis of the situation, the island, and all the available resources
* Discuss the importance of getting off the island
* Ask individuals to show everyone whatever they know about sailing
