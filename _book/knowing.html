<p>‚ÄúIf you are human, you love stories. Why? We‚Äôre hardwired to love stories because they help us understand
our world and are essential to our evolution. We use stories to organise and communicate our surroundings
and our past, present and future‚Äù ‚ÄîHeather Box and Julian Mocine-McQueen <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-freeyourstory" role="doc-biblioref">Box and Mocine-McQueen 2019</a>)</span></p>

<p>Self-awareness, understanding who you are, is important for leading a healthy and happy life, and likely to be an important factor in your future success. One way to develop self-awareness is to think about what your story is. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-freeyourstory" role="doc-biblioref">Box and Mocine-McQueen 2019</a>)</span> How did you get here, where are you going, what has inspired you? Who is the authentic you? <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-regrets" role="doc-biblioref">Ware 2011</a>)</span> What are your hopes and dreams? By starting to answer these questions you will gain a better understanding of who you are.

<p>Universities offer many opportunities for self improvement, self discovery and developing your unique skills. One way to build your self-awareness is to reflect on your knowledge, values and skills. In Waldorf education this is characterised as ‚Äúhead, heart and hands.‚Äù <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-headhearthands" role="doc-biblioref">Easton 1997</a>)</span></p>

<p>Many of the learning outcomes described above are non-trivial. You may have good self-awareness and be able to describe aspects of who you are in a matter of minutes. Other personality traits make take longer to realise. You can develop better self-awareness by describing four attributes shown in Figure <a href="knowing.html#fig:iki-fig">2.2</a>, together these are known as your ikigai (Áîü„ÅçÁî≤Êñê) or ‚Äúreason for being.‚Äù</p>
<ul>

<!--luke: I'm not sure of the link to coding challenges here.-->
<p>This chapter has looked at some big issues around identity, by inviting you to think about some fundamental questions. Another way to think about these questions is as coding challenges. They are non-trivial questions to answer, it might take you weeks, months or even years to answer some of them. But they are worth spending time thinking about</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your values?</li>
<li>What makes you happy?</li>
<li>What do you want to get from your time at University?</li>

Figuring out exactly who your authentic self is can be challenging. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronnie_Ware">Bronnie Ware‚Äôs</a> book might help, it has some very moving, personal and insightful true stories of peoples regrets that will illuminate your own values and might just change your life. The top five regrets, outlined in the book are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I wish I‚Äôd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me</li>
<li>I wish I hadn‚Äôt worked so hard</li>
<li>I wish I‚Äôd had the courage to express my feelings</li>
<li>I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends</li>
<li>I wish that I had let myself be happier</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to be courageous to live a regret-free life but the alternative is to die full of regret, see Bronnie‚Äôs video in figure <a href="knowing.html#fig:bronnie-fig">2.4</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>Since first being published in 1972, over ten million copies of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Color_is_Your_Parachute%3F">What Colour is Your Parachute?</a></em> have been sold. It has been translated into 20 languages and is used in 26 countries. What is good about <em>Parachute</em> is that it has some useful <em>self-inventory</em> exercises that go beyond the introductory ones in this guidebook, particularly in the context of your future career. While the style and examples can be U.S. centric, it‚Äôs a classic self-help book that looks at a broad variety of issues around job hunting. The author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nelson_Bolles">Richard Nelson Bolles</a> was a Harvard educated chemical engineer and he explains how you can‚Äôt possibly decide what to do in five years time in the video in figure <a href="knowing.html#fig:bolles-fig">2.5</a>. Where do you see yourself in five years time? is a question some interviewers like to ask.</p>

<p>Reflecting on your identity should lead you to check any privileges you might have. Being grateful for any privileges you may have is also beneficial for your mental health which we talk about in the chapter on <a href="wellbeing.html#wellbeing">your well-being</a> So:</p>
<ul>

<p><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read">Too long, didn‚Äôt read</a> (TL;DR)? Here‚Äôs a summary:</p>
<p>This chapter has looked at who you are. Being self aware, understanding your strengths and weaknesses is key to getting what you want from your career. Questions about your identity are non-trivial, hopefully this chapter has started you thinking about who you are, what motivates you and what you want out of life. You need to keep thinking about your identity because some aspects of your identity may be constantly changing.</p>
<p>These are fundamental design questions you‚Äôll need to address when you starting building your future. We touched on understanding any privileges you may have as being important for understanding who you are but also in being beneficial for your mental health.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we‚Äôll look at mental health in more detail.</p>
