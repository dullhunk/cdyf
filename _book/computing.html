<p>It’s difficult to think of any aspect of our lives that hasn’t been changed by the invention of the digital computer, just 70 short years ago. Consequently, computing is a crucial skill in a wide range of careers across every sector of business and society. You don’t have to have studied Computer Science at University to take advantage of all the exciting opportunities provided by computing. This chapter looks at why computing is a subject for everyone. If you’re studying computing, this chapter isn’t aimed at you, unless you are struggling to stay motivated with your subject! 👨🏿‍💻👨‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩‍💻👨🏿‍💻</p>

<p>Reading this chapter and doing the activities will help you to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify where you can get started with computing, if you’re not studying computer science as a major part of your degree</li>
<li>Describe why NOT studying computer science doesn’t necessarily “lock you out” of computing as a career</li>
</ol>
<!--* Describe why computing is a stimulating and challenging subject to study in its own right
* Identify creative opportunities in computing, whatever your background--><p>But why should everyone be studying computing? There are social and economic arguments:</p>

<div id="creative" class="section level2" number="6.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Computing is for everybody<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creative"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>At school, everyone learns to read, write and do maths. These are sometimes known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_three_Rs">the three Rs</a> but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did you learn to read and write? Was it so that you could become a professional writer?</li>
<li>Why did you study mathematics? Was it so that you could become a professional mathematician?</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course not, that would be ludicrous! You learned to read and write because they are fundamental tools for expressing yourself and communicating with other people. You studied maths so that you could develop numeracy, reason about the world around you, analyse data and solve problems.</p>
<p>So why should everyone learn about computing? Is it so that everyone can become software engineers? Again, this is patently ludicrous.</p>
<p>Everyone should study computing for the same reasons everyone studies maths and english at school. Like writing, computing is one of the most creative tools for expression and communication that we have today. Just like mathematics, studying computing will also help you to solve important problems too. Sam Aaron, creator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Pi">Sonic Pi</a>, puts exactly this case for creative computing in his TEDx talk <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-youtube-sonicpi" role="doc-biblioref">Aaron 2016</a>)</span> shown in figure <a href="computing.html#fig:sonicpi-fig">6.2</a>.</p>

<p>Computing is also an intellectually stimulating and challenging subject to study in its own right. If you don’t believe me, I’m not going to make the case here. Have a look at Silvio Peroni’s free computational thinking and programming book at <a href="https://comp-think.github.io/">comp-think.github.io</a> which is written for people with a background in the humanities. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-peroni" role="doc-biblioref">Peroni 2021</a>)</span></p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Software is eating your future<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#seating"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Whatever future world you enter into after you graduate, there’s a good chance it has already been eaten by software. In 2011, the software engineer and billionaire investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreesen</a> outlined why (in his opinion, figure <a href="computing.html#fig:eating-fig">6.3</a>) software is eating the world, in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-eatingtheworld" role="doc-biblioref">Andreessen 2011</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many people lack the digital skills required to take advantage of all the opportunities provided by software and computing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)">Robert Sedgwick</a> at Princeton University has, like many others, argued that Computer Science should be a <strong>required</strong> topic of study for <em>all</em> undergraduate students in University. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-robertsedgwick" role="doc-biblioref">Sedgwick 2019</a>)</span> We’re not there yet because computing is a subject that has historically been siloed in Computer Science Departments, but this is changing as we’ll see in this chapter. It’s not that everyone should jump ship to Computer Science, but that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.bcs.org/content-hub/computings-too-important-to-be-left-to-men/">Computing is too important to be left to men</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-sparckjones" role="doc-biblioref">Spärck-Jones and Runciman 2007</a>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever subject you are currently studying, adding some computing to your education will empower you with the computational thinking skills you need to be an active producer, not just a passive consumer in modern society. Computing can open up new opportunities for you and improve your social mobility.</p>
<!--
The gist of his argument is that Computer Science is too important to be left to Computer Scientists, because it influences every field of human endeavour.

<p>Besides the social arguments, there are also strong economic reasons for studying computing. It’s not just software that’s eating the world, but its combination with hardware that dominates the list of the world’s largest corporations by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization">market capitalisation</a>, shown in figure <a href="computing.html#fig:market-fig">6.4</a>.

<p>What figure <a href="computing.html#fig:market-fig">6.4</a> and figure <a href="computing.html#fig:market-again-fig">6.5</a> show is that computing is eating the stock market. This means that commercial demand for software developers is high, comparable to teaching and nursing in terms of raw numbers. In the UK, the most common jobs for graduates from 2019 are shown in figure <a href="computing.html#fig:nurses-fig">6.6</a>, based on data taken from an <a href="https://luminate.prospects.ac.uk/uk-graduate-labour-market-update-11-january">update on the graduate labour market in 2022</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-labourmarket2022" role="doc-biblioref">Ball 2022b</a>)</span></p>

<p>So if you can develop software, there’s lots of choice and opportunities on offer. Although the data in figure <a href="computing.html#fig:nurses-fig">6.6</a> is from the UK, the story is the same in many other countries around the world.

<p>All this choice is a great thing but what sort of role do you want computing to play in your career? You can either be a passive consumer of computing or you can be an active producer, shaping the world of computing to get want you want from it, rather than what it wants from you. Going back to Andreesen’s eating analogy in section <a href="computing.html#seating">6.3</a>, the choice is to be an <em>eater</em> or be <em>eaten</em>. Or to use a gaming analogy, <em>play</em> or be <em>played</em>.</p>

<p>Because of its social and economic importance, computing also gives you flexible career options. If academic disciplines are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card_suit">playing card suits</a>, then Computer Science is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(playing_card)">joker in the pack</a> shown in figure <a href="computing.html#fig:joker-fig">6.7</a>. A versatile card, the computational joker can be played with (and without) <em>any</em> of the traditional four suits: diamonds, clubs, hearts and spades. That’s because computing is a science <em>and</em> an art. It allows us to study human society and culture, so it’s part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities">humanities</a> too (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities">digital humanities</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science">computational social science</a> for example). Last but not least, computing is also an engineering discipline and a branch of mathematics too. What all this means is that the computational joker is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(cards)">wild card</a> that can be played <em>whenever and wherever</em> you like, making it an incredibly powerful but dangerous card, depending on the game you are playing (see chapter <a href="broadening.html#broadening">9</a>). ♣♥♠♦🃏</p>

<p>The flexibility of computing as a career means you have a broad range of options on where you can apply your computational skills. You don’t <em>have</em> to be studying Computer Science to take advantage of these opportunities, but it helps.</p>

## Google Summer of Code

see
https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-advice

and also

look
advice via  Bujanca:

1. Read the entire GSoC site including materials
1. What computer science subject area or specific issue or problem interests you? What are your skills? What languages do you know? What tools are you familiar with?
1. Look through the list of organisations. There's a lot of them, it might be slightly overwhelming, but you'll need to narrow it down. Pick at most 5 of them. You won't have time to look at all of them in depth so follow your interests and gut feeling.
1. Visit the org's site and repos. Look at the code, look at feature requests, issues and bug reports

* Look at the past projects of those 5. It'll become clear that some of them are generally very competitive and usually take final year or masters students for their projects. Narrow it down to 3 organisations.

1. Start engaging with mentors and other students or the community around those 3 organisations. Again, it'll become clear which projects within each organisation are the most popular. Ask for advice. Read project descriptions and draft lists of questions.
1. By the time the student application period begins, you should know which organisation you are going for, even if you're not sure about the project yet.
1. As soon as you picked a project, start working on your proposal, and start asking for feedback early on. You don't have to have a finished proposal to ask for feedback, mentors are more often than not willing to guide you.
1. Your proposal has to highlight two things well: how your background and experience are relevant to the project, and your understanding of the project. The understanding of the project part is crucial: successful applicants usually have a draft timeline. Given that there are 12 weeks, you are expected to mention what you expect to be doing each week. Importantly, after each 4 weeks, you'll have a review / milestone. Make sure it's very clear what your milestones will be.
1. Optional: if you are proposing your own project rather than picking one proposed by the organisation, you'll need to convince the organisation that your idea brings them more value than what they've already proposed. This will require a good understanding of the scope of the organisation and isn't always easy.-->
