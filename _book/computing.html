</h1>
<p>It’s difficult to think of any aspect of our lives that hasn’t been changed by the invention of the digital computer, just 70 short years ago. Consequently, computing is a crucial skill in a wide range of careers across every sector of business and society. You don’t have to have studied Computer Science at University to take advantage of all the exciting opportunities provided by computing. This chapter looks at some of those opportunities for those with, and without, degrees in Computer Science. 👩‍💻👨‍💻</p>

<p>Reading this chapter and doing the activities will help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe why computing is a stimulating and challenging subject to study in its own right</li>
<li>Identify roles where studying computer science is relevant, beyond software engineering</li>
<li>Describe why NOT studying computer science doesn’t necessarily “lock you out” of doing taking on some of these roles</li>

</h2>
<p>What role will computing play in your future career? A Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)">Robert Sedgwick</a>, has, like many others, argued that Computer Science should be required of all students:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every college student needs a computer science course, and most need two or more. More and more educators are
beginning to recognize this truth, but we are a long way from meeting the need. –Robert Sedgwick <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-robertsedgwick" role="doc-biblioref">Sedgwick 2019</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--
The gist of his argument is that Computer Science is too important to be left to Computer Scientists, because it influences every field of human endeavour.

and also

look
advice via  Bujanca:

1. Read the entire GSoC site including materials
1. What computer science subject area or specific issue or problem interests you? What are your skills? What languages do you know? What tools are you familiar with?
1. Look through the list of organisations. There's a lot of them, it might be slightly overwhelming, but you'll need to narrow it down. Pick at most 5 of them. You won't have time to look at all of them in depth so follow your interests and gut feeling.
1. Visit the org's site and repos. Look at the code, look at feature requests, issues and bug reports

* Look at the past projects of those 5. It'll become clear that some of them are generally very competitive and usually take final year or masters students for their projects. Narrow it down to 3 organisations.

1. Start engaging with mentors and other students or the community around those 3 organisations. Again, it'll become clear which projects within each organisation are the most popular. Ask for advice. Read project descriptions and draft lists of questions.
1. By the time the student application period begins, you should know which organisation you are going for, even if you're not sure about the project yet.
1. As soon as you picked a project, start working on your proposal, and start asking for feedback early on. You don't have to have a finished proposal to ask for feedback, mentors are more often than not willing to guide you.
1. Your proposal has to highlight two things well: how your background and experience are relevant to the project, and your understanding of the project. The understanding of the project part is crucial: successful applicants usually have a draft timeline. Given that there are 12 weeks, you are expected to mention what you expect to be doing each week. Importantly, after each 4 weeks, you'll have a review / milestone. Make sure it's very clear what your milestones will be.
1. Optional: if you are proposing your own project rather than picking one proposed by the organisation, you'll need to convince the organisation that your idea brings them more value than what they've already proposed. This will require a good understanding of the scope of the organisation and isn't always easy.-->
