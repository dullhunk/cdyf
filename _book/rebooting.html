<p>The first part of this book is about <em>designing</em> your future. Before we get started, we need to reboot and tackle a fundamental design issue. Why the hell would you want to bother reading this guidebook when you have so many other things to do right now?</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ You are a busy person, <em>YES</em>!</li>
<li>✅ Your time is a precious and finite resource, <em>YES</em>!</li>
<li>✅ You could be spending that precious time right now in lots of other ways, <em>YES</em>!</li>
<li>✅ There are mountains of self-help guides and courses already, <em>YES</em>!</li>
<li>✅ Do you really need <em>yet another</em> guidebook? <em>YES! YES! YES</em>!</li>
</ul>
<p>You should read this guidebook because it is different to all the other guidebooks! It will help you design, test, build, debug and <code>code</code> your future in computing.</p>
<p>Before you start coding, we need to reboot. Come with me down the rabbit hole in figure <a href="rebooting#fig:rabbit-fig">1.1</a> and let me explain… 🐇</p>

What she discovers is a strange underground world populated by weird and wonderful characters. The world of work can sometimes be a mysterious underworld where you adventure in wonderland accompanied by colourful characters.</p>
<p>You will spend lots of time in this wonderland, potentially as much as 80,000 hours as part of the 4000 weeks of your life. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-iip1" role="doc-biblioref">Investor 2019</a>, <a href="reading#ref-iip2" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>; <a href="reading#ref-fourthousandweeks" role="doc-biblioref">Burkeman 2021</a>)</span> So join me down the rabbit hole, it’s fun (honest), and sooner or later you’ll have to come down here anyway.

<p>Studying at University opens new doors to your future, some of which will take you down rabbit holes. As the poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemn_Sissay">Lemn Sissay</a> puts it (figure <a href="rebooting#fig:lemn-fig">1.2</a>):</p>

<p>As well as opening your future, studying at University is about <em>investing</em> in your future. You’re spending lots of your time and money at University. Hopefully, you’ve picked a subject that stimulates and challenges you intellectually while allowing you to find and develop your unique talents. But there’s another reason that you probably chose to study at University and that was to improve your job prospects. This guidebook will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Help you maximise the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment">return on investment</a> (ROI) of the substantial amount of your time and money you have already put into your education, from high school through to University</li>
<li>Give you an overview of important professional issues that are sometimes neglected or sidelined in school and University curricula</li>
<li>Highlight and review essential resources beyond this guidebook that will help with the above</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the resources that can help you are scattered around in lots of different places. There are books, there are videos, there are podcasts, there are websites and jobs boards. There are online courses, blogs, social media, newspaper columns, journal articles, marketing material and many other good resources. It is overwhelming.</p>

<p>When Andy Stanford-Clark started working at IBM as a graduate fresh out of University, his manager gave him the career advice shown in figure <a href="rebooting#fig:andysc-fig">1.3</a>:</p>

<p>Andy is now Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of IBM in the UK and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Master_Inventor">IBM Master inventor</a>, so it was probably good advice. There are plenty people who can help design and build your future, ultimately it is <strong>YOU</strong> who has to take responsibility for the implementation (if you like, the <code>code</code>). The sooner you get coding the better.</p>
<p>At University, there are lots of people can help design and build your future: peers, friends, academic staff, your careers service, employers and your wider social and professional networks but ultimately it is <em>your</em> responsibility to sort out whatever comes next. That might sound obvious but don’t wait to get started later or for somebody else to do it for you, because it probably won’t happen.</p>

<!--Luke comments: One thing I would add in this section that you don't really think about until you go through it is the difference between going for a CS job and that job you really want. Most grads will get a job in CS, but few will get those really prized ones that they really enjoy.-->
<p>You have worked hard to get the grades you needed to get into University. You’ve spent (or are spending) a significant amount of time and money studying your chosen discipline. You are really <em>geeking out</em> by going deep into your subject for a substantial period of time. Geekery, by which I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek">being interested in a subject for its own sake</a>, is a <em>good</em> thing. Earning the title <em>geek</em> is a compliment, not an insult, and you should wear your geek badge with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Pride_Day">geek pride</a>! Some people even say:</p>
<ul>
<li>The geeks will inherit the earth, see figure <a href="rebooting#fig:geekout-fig">1.4</a>

<p>As a studious geek you might be tempted to believe that the world owes you something in return for all your geekiness. Unfortunately that’s not the case.</p>
<p>At some point during or after your study, you might find yourself applying for a graduate job or graduate scheme. EVERYONE applying for these opportunities will have a degree or be rapidly on their way to getting one. So having a degree, even a really geeky one, isn’t going to set you apart much from your competition. Even having a first class degree may not distinguish you that much your competitors <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-gradeinflation" role="doc-biblioref">Coughlan 2019a</a>; <a href="reading#ref-firstclass" role="doc-biblioref">Borrett 2019</a>)</span>. Some employers would rather not know (or don’t care) what University you went to, so your education might not make you stand out as much as you might like anyway. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-bigfour" role="doc-biblioref">Agnew 2016</a>; <a href="reading#ref-eyfirm" role="doc-biblioref">Garner 2015</a>)</span></p>
<!--Reducing the Stress of Perfectionism
Perfectionism has a way of robbing us of that glow of achievement and ultimately making us miserable. Having high standards is good but not if they make everything in life so challenging that we are exhausted before we have even started!

If you find that you are never really satisfied with your achievements, spend a lot of time procrastinating rather than working and are increasingly self-critical, then this could be the workshop for you. You will learn:

* About the psychology of the perfectionist
* how perfectionism becomes self-defeating.
* ways of challenging the rigid perfectionist mindset

<p>Now, don’t be disillusioned by the statistics because any degree can open doors to many careers in computing. Studying <em>computing</em> opens up plenty of doors, see figure <a href="computing#fig:nurses-fig">5.7</a>. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/lmicharlie">Charlie Ball</a>, it is a myth that there aren’t enough graduate jobs; one of four myths in the UK about the graduate labour market:</p>

<p>What the data in figure <a href="rebooting#fig:lotsofgrads-fig">1.5</a> show is that you’ll need to look <strong>beyond</strong> your formal education to distinguish yourself from your competition. Your degree can certainly help you start a career, and computer geekery is a commercially valuable skill but a degree (however geeky) is typically not enough by itself.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of graduate jobs for you to apply for, but that doesn’t mean its going to be easy to walk into one when you graduate. Employers are looking for more from their employees than just <em>having</em> a degree, see chapter <a href="experiencing#experiencing">7</a>.</p>

Software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)">Paul Graham</a> and journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Burkeman">Oliver Burkeman</a> describe three types of procrastination:</p>

<p>Postponing decisions about your future is usually bad procrastination, because you risk neglecting the wrong things. You are relying on doing all your (career) testing at the end, when you graduate. You are procrastinating the <code>testing</code> stage of your career development, when its often better to test early and test often, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ “test-last (career) development” where you get experience at the end, <em>after</em> you graduate</li>
<li>✅ “test-driven (career) development” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>) where you get experience <em>before</em> you graduate</li>
</ul>
<p>It probably doesn’t help that many of the issues described and discussed in this book are typically not closely integrated into the curriculum in Higher Education. You’ll often find them on the edges, or completely outside of, standard University curricula.</p>
<!--Broadly speaking, the professional issues described in this book are usually covered by

* pastoral support systems
* counselling services
* careers services
* trade organisations
* professional bodies
* student unions and their societies.-->
<p>Despite being sidelined, these issues matter and it is in your own self interests to start thinking about them right now. According to recent estimates by <em>Investors in People</em>, the average person spends <strong>80,000 hours</strong> working during their lifetime. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-iip2" role="doc-biblioref">Investor 2020</a>)</span> So, <em>whatever</em> you end up doing after University, you’ll be spending a lot of time doing it. Difficult decisions often get sidelined but it is never too early to <em>experiencing your future</em>, see chapter <a href="experiencing#experiencing">7</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to work for a big name like those in section <a href="experiencing#bignames">7.3.3</a> or <a href="finding#studentjobs">8.3.1</a>, many of the larger graduate employers expect you to have <em>some</em> experience (see chapter <a href="experiencing#experiencing">7</a>) <em>before</em> you graduate. A large chunk of vacancies on graduate schemes are filled with people who have already been employed as interns or placement students within that (or another) organisation. So the sooner you start investigating employers by getting some experience the better decisions you’ll be able to make about what comes next. It’s (usually) too late when you graduate.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean you have to know EXACTLY what you want to do when you finish. Lots of students don’t and I certainly didn’t when I graduated. I’d done a gap year teaching in India, two summer internships (in Sweden and the United States) and a year-in-industry in the UK and I <em>still</em> graduated with <strong>no clue</strong> as to what I wanted to do next! The important thing is that you make a start by getting some experience, paid or otherwise, see chapter <a href="experiencing#experiencing">7</a>. Sometimes knowing what you <strong>don’t</strong> want to do is just as valuable as knowing what you <em>DO</em> want to do. Either way, your future starts now, see figure <a href="rebooting#fig:future-now-fig">1.8</a>.</p>

<p>So, <em>yes</em>, this will be on the exam, but <em>no</em>, the exams are obviously not set, administered, invigilated and marked by academics at your University. The exams are set by employers and the results are <strong>brutally binary</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>PASS</strong>: you’ve got the interview, job or promotion or…</li>
<li>
<strong>FAIL</strong>: none of the above. Next!</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the challenging things about employers exams are, they typically do not have the bandwidth to give applicants useful feedback, other than a simple pass or fail. When it comes to job applications software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell">Gayle Laakmann McDowell</a> calls this the “black hole”. The gravitational force of employers black holes is so strong that no CV or Résumé can escape, we’ll say more about this in chapter <a href="debugging#debugging">6</a> on debugging your future.</p>

<li>
<strong>PACE</strong>: By giving you greater control over how much, at what level, and what kind of intensity you study, I encourage you to set your own pace. Take as much or as little as you want, see section <a href="https://www.cdyf.me#gut">0.4.2</a>

<p>Some career resources claim (or imply) that they are the <em>all you will need</em> to solve a particular problem or worse: solve <em>all of your problems</em>! Just buy this book, do this course, watch these videos, listen to this podcast, pass this test and all your problems will go away! Rather than continue this trend, this book <strong>signposts</strong> some of the most useful resources, see figure <a href="rebooting#fig:signposting-fig">1.11</a>.</p>

<p>Scientists call signposting <strong>citation</strong>, so I’ve signposted and cited sources in this guidebook so that you can :</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Follow them if the destinations are interesting or useful</li>
<li>Check and verify any facts and claims I make in this book for yourself</li>
</ol>
<p>While this guidebook cites lots of resources, some of them are more important than others. Each chapter summarises these in a signposts section. You’ll find everything else in the references, chapter <a href="reading#reading">27</a>. University and public libraries may also have physical and electronic copies of some of the books listed here.</p>
<!--If you're studying at the University of Manchester, these signposts are available as a library reading list at [library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/reading-lists](https://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/reading-lists).-->
<p>I’m not suggesting that you read <em>all</em> these books right now, but that if a particular chapter has piqued your interest, these signposts are good places to keep going, if you haven’t already read them. I hope you’ll find these signposts handy for navigating the mountains of advice. Not all who wander are lost. 🗺️🧭</p>

<p>This guidebook to your future accompanies a course that has been co-designed by students for students, with input from academics and employers. It unites several disparate themes into one coherent story, from fundamental questions about identity and wellbeing through to more applied and practical advice on job hunting, career progression and life after University. Resources that do this are typically scattered around in many different places. There is usually no narrative to tie them all together to help students navigate the mountains of advice as they embark on the first stages of their careers. I’ll guide you through the narrative, but it is a flexible <em>descriptive</em> story rather than an inflexible <em>prescriptive</em> one, see figure <a href="rebooting#fig:descriptive-fig">1.12</a>.</p>

<p>A lot of scientific and technical writing is written in the third person or passive voice. It can be cold and impersonal which is fine for academic writing, but can alienate readers. I have opted to use first person narrative where possible as it is shorter, and hopefully more engaging for you to read. Where relevant, I’ve told people’s stories, to illustrate key points. There’s plenty of emotion here too, because job searching can be an emotional rollercoaster: from anxiety, joy, depression, frustration, hope, anger and englightenment - it’s all here.</p>

</h2>
<p>Each chapter in this book has a signposts section, highlighting key reading, watching or listening you could do next. This chapter has addressed the question of <strong>why should you bother coding your future</strong>? The answer is that your future is your responsibility and no-one elses. There are lots of people can help shape your future, but none more than yourself. Software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin">Robert C. Martin</a> argues this point in his book <em>The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</em>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-cleancoder" role="doc-biblioref">Martin 2011</a>)</span></p>
<p>What’s good about <em>The Clean Coder</em> is that it is short (only 200 pages), well written and to the point. The main part of the book covers professional issues in software engineering, some of which I discuss further in chapter <a href="surviving#surviving">11</a>, <em>surviving your future</em>.</p>

<p>The TL;DR for this chapter is, you should read this guidebook because it is different to all the other guidebooks. It will help you take responsibility for maximising your future. No-one else is going to do this for you. Your degree will help open up future options, but it is not enough by itself so you’ll need to maximise the return on your investment. Don’t procrastinate because it’s too late when you graduate and <em>YES</em> this will be on the exam (set by future employers). This guidebook has signposts to help you navigate, design, build, test, debug and code your future in computing.</p>
<p>It looks like the reboot has finished, so we’re ready to go. In the next chapter, you will reflect on who you are. What’s your story, coding glory?
