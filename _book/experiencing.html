<p>So what counts as experience?</p>
<ul>
<li>Freelance work: being self-employed</li>
<li>Insight programmes and spring weeks: work shadowing</li>
<li>Part-time jobs: casual or part-time work</li>

<span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Big names experience<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bignames"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s easier than you might think to get a big name on your CV. For example, many large employers run <a href="https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights">insight days, vacation schemes and spring weeks</a>. These are often aimed at first years, and are sometimes less competitive to get into than a longer term commitment such as a summer internship, year-long placement or even graduate job. A big name on your CV early in your degree can help it stand out later, as fluff bucket the grinning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Cat">Cheshire Cat</a> demonstrates on their CV shown in <a href="experiencing.html#fig:bigname-fig">5.3</a>. ðŸ˜»</p>

<p>Other ways to get a big name on your CV include joining a big name competition or event, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google has Code Jam, HashCode and Kick Start <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/">codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com</a> and Summer of Code <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">summerofcode.withgoogle.com</a>
</li>
<li>Facebook has hackathons <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/hackathon">facebook.com/hackathon</a>
</li>
<li>Microsoft hosts the Imagine Cup <a href="https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/">imaginecup.microsoft.com</a>
</li>
<li>There are many others like it listed at <a href="https://devpost.com">devpost.com</a> and Major League Hacking <a href="https://mlh.io/">mlh.io</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Big names look good on your CV, but they are not the only way to stand out.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Voluntary experience<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#volunteering"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Experience in the CV sense usually means paid work. However, experience in the context of <em>are you experienced?</em> means anything where you can show youâ€™ve been part of a bigger team, taken responsibility for something or tried to make the world a better place somehow. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteering: Doing voluntary work is a good way to pick up new skills</li>
<li>Being involved in societies: e.g.Â taking responsibility for things in a student society</li>
<li>Getting involved in your local community</li>
</ul>

## Excuses, excuses   {#excuses}

When I tell students this, I'm often given an excuses some of which are given below.


### I missed the deadline  {#deadlines}

Stuff

### I'm busy waiting  {#busywaiting}


<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/is-it-just-me.png" alt="(ref:justme)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:justme-fig)(ref:justme)</p>
</div>
(ref:justme) The biggest waste of time is the time spent being busy waiting, and not making a start. Starting a career by getting some experience can be a daunting project, but don't allow yourself to be held captive by irrational worries about the job market. Once you start a daunting project, you will begin to see it for what it is. The ideas will come and and you won't need to fear it anymore, you may even start to enjoy the process of figuring out what your career options you are most interested in. [New Project?

###Â I don't know what I want to do  {#noclue}  

I don't know what I want to do

### I don't have any experience  

Stuff


###Â I do not have the grades  

Whatever you are studying, its easy to fall into a trap of thinking that your grades aren't good enough. While there are some employers who really care about your grades, there are plenty who don't. These employers are more interested in what you're like as a person, so any projects, experience or other activities you've done that demonstrate will help you stand out against rival candidates with better grades.




###Â I am too busy  

Stuff


###Â I keep getting rejected  

Stuff


###Â I am overwhelmed by the choices  

Stuff


###Â It is too competitive  

Stuff


### All my friends have found jobs already  

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/not-very-good-at-this.png" alt="(ref:captionnotverygood)" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:grades-fig)(ref:captionnotverygood)</p>
</div>

(ref:captionnotverygood) Do you have the grades? Not all employers care about your academic grades because they're only a small part of what you have to offer as an employee.

What have you done


### I didn't get my dream job  

didn't get graduate scheme (look at graduate jobs), missed my dream job at CERN, Google, Facebook etc.
