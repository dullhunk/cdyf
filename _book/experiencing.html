<p>It’s common for students to be focused on their grades, whether those grades are low, middling or or high. At the extremes, if you have got lower grades than you’d like, you might be anxious or unhappy about them. If you’ve got higher grades, you’re probably focussed on keeping them high. Either way, you are <em>much more</em> than your grades, because your education is only a part of who you are. You are the sum total of your experiences, this is one of the reasons that experience is so valuable, see figure <a href="experiencing.html#fig:experience-fig">5.3</a></p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:experience-fig"></span>
<img src="images/experience.jpeg" alt="Experience is one of the best ways to develop know-how. While your formal education and academic study can help you develop know-what, you need to complement this knowledge with a range of experiences and on-the-job learning.

<p>Your experience tells a story about who you are and what you’re capable of. Experience makes you more <em>employable</em> which means:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>experience will improve your chances of being invited to interview</li>
<li>experience will improve your chances of being offered a job after an interview</li>
<li>experience will broaden and deepen your skills and knowledge, see figure <a href="knowing.html#fig:goal-fig">2.1</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Paul Redmond at the University of Liverpool describes experience as a key part of employability <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-paulredmond" role="doc-biblioref">Redmond 2010</a>)</span> as expressed in his graduate jobs formula shown in equation <a href="experiencing.html#eq:redmond">(5.1)</a>.</p>
<div class="rmdnote">
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:redmond">\[\begin{equation}
  E = Q + WE + S \times C
  \tag{5.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>According to Redmond, your employability (<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>) is the sum of your qualifications (<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>), your work experience (<span class="math inline">\(WE\)</span>) and your strategies (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) multiplied by your contacts (<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>). It is difficult to quantify employability so precisely but Redmond’s equation <a href="experiencing.html#eq:redmond">(5.1)</a> is a good starting point for discussion. We will look at some strategies and contacts in chapter <a href="finding.html#finding">8</a>, this chapter will focus on how to maximise your experience (<span class="math inline">\(WE\)</span>).</p>

<p>So what counts as experience? Employers use terms to describe jobs and experience for undergraduates and graduates inconsistently. So I’ve defined and outlined terms for relevant kinds of experience shown in table <a href="experiencing.html#tab:jobterms">5.1</a> and we’ll use these definitions throughout the book.</p>

<!-- to do compare and contrast summer vs year long--><p>Some of the experience outlined in table <a href="experiencing.html#tab:jobterms">5.1</a> was probably what you were already thinking of as experience, however there are three important sources of experience that students often overlook:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Voluntary work</strong>: Any kind of work where you’ve given your time and labour to a community. That could be non-technical (working for a charity) or technical, such as contributing to open-source software, see section <a href="experiencing.html#opensource">5.3.3</a> and figure <a href="experiencing.html#fig:volunthero-fig">5.4</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Casual work</strong>: Working in hospitality or retail (etc) is often overlooked by students as an important source of relevant experience. It doesn’t have to be technical to be relevant to employers, see section <a href="experiencing.html#casual">5.3.5</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Student societies</strong> Your students’ union will have hundreds of official societies you can get involved in, and they’ll be plenty of unofficial fringe communities too. As well as helping you develop new or existing interests, these societies give you an opportunity to serve a particular community of interest. Many societies seek members to take on positions of responsibility, above and beyond merely participating in their events. They provide fantastic opportunities to build new skills in a safe and supportive environment.</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:volunthero-fig"></span>
<img src="images/volunthero.jpeg" alt="Volunteering is a great source of experience that employers value.

<p>Before we discuss these experiences, lets look at some of the more conventional places for getting experience:</p>
<!--* Competitions: participating in competitions and hackathons will make your CV stand out-->
<div id="bignames" class="section level3" number="5.3.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Big name experience<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bignames"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It’s probably easier than you might think to get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">big tech</a> or big employer name on your CV. For example, many large employers run <a href="https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights">insight days, vacation schemes and spring weeks</a>. These are often aimed at first year undergraduates, and are sometimes less competitive to get into than a longer term commitment such as a summer internship, year-long placement or even graduate job. A big name on your CV early in your degree can help it stand out later, as fluff bucket the grinning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Cat">cheshire cat</a> demonstrates on their CV shown in figure <a href="experiencing.html#fig:bigname-fig">5.5</a>. 😻</p>

<p>Any experience will help your CV stand out. Smaller employers have the advantage that they tend to be less picky than big names so it is often easier to get a foot in the door. It might not be what you see yourself doing for long, but the experience gained in a small company can be invaluable. You might even prefer working in a small company to a big corporation or conglomeration.</p>

<li>Raise a new issue via the project’s issue tracker, such as <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">github issues</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-githubissues" role="doc-biblioref">Octocat 2020</a>)</span>

</ol>
<p>There are lots of different motivations for getting involved in open source, shown in figure <a href="experiencing.html#fig:opensource-fig">5.7</a>. Whatever your motivation, contributing to open source software is fun, you’ll learn heaps and it will look <em>great</em> on your CV. Open source software is widely used by, so contributing is a great way to get some real world experience of software development. Many open source projects are funded by employers both large and small, and you can get paid to develop open source software through projects like Google’s Summer of Code. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-gsoc" role="doc-biblioref">Anonymous Googler 2021</a>)</span></p>

<p>If you’re looking for a project to get stuck into, here are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diomidis_Spinellis">Diomidis Spinellis</a> tips for getting started <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-Spinellis" role="doc-biblioref">Spinellis 2021</a>)</span>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose a project with several active contributors, so that there is a community to help you</li>
<li>Choose a relatively popular project (with some GitHub stars) so that you can avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware">abandonware</a> but…</li>
<li>… Avoid “blockbuster” projects like <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow">tensorflow</a> or <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">vscode</a> , so that your contributions will not get lost in the politics and bureaucracy of a large project</li>
<li>Verify that you can build and run the project from your own setup</li>
<li>Ensure the project regularly accepts pull requests from outsiders, so that yours contributions will have a chance of being accepted</li>
<li>Contribute a trivial fix to start with to test your ability use the project’s workflows</li>
</ol>
<p>The guidelines for prospective contributors to Google’s Summer of Code (GSoC) at <a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/">google.github.io/gsocguides/student</a> go into more depth about how you can get involved in open source software development.

<p>Experience as a section of your CV usually means <em>paid</em> work. However, experience in the context of this chapter means anything where you can show you’ve been part of a bigger team, taken responsibility for something or tried to make the world a better place somehow. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteering: Doing voluntary work is a good way to pick up new skills</li>
<li>Being involved in societies: e.g. taking responsibility for things in a society</li>
<li>Getting involved in a community, either physical or online</li>

<span class="header-section-number">5.3.5</span> Casual experience<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#casual"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>You may already have experience of paid employment as a casual or part-time worker. This could include jobs such as waiting tables, serving in a bar or working in other areas of hospitality or retail, for example as a Saturday job.</p>

<p>It is important to recognise that these jobs have value. Many students make the mistake of overlooking their casual work experience because they disregard it as non-technical or consider it “low-skilled.” In the section <a href="debugging.html#mycvst">7.6</a> we saw that one of the stories you want to tell in your job applications is that you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>take responsibility</li>
<li>achieve things</li>
<li>are nice to have around</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing casual work can demonstrate all of these things. For example, from the ages of 12 to 18 I was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy">paperboy</a>, except unlike the Titanic paperboy selling newspapers in the street in figure <a href="experiencing.html#fig:paperboy-fig">5.8</a>, I delivered newspapers directly to the doors of paying customers every morning. This was not a particularly highly skilled job, but it <em>does</em> demonstrate:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_ethic">work ethic</a>: getting up early <em>every</em> morning (including Saturdays). Sometimes work is about just turning up everyday!</li>
<li>taking responsibility and being reliable</li>
<li>understanding the value of money by earning a wage</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve often spoken to students who neglect to tell me about their paid work in retail or hospitality. “But it’s not technical” they say, “it’s low skilled and irrelevant.” However, serving customers demonstrates your ability to provide good customer service and work as part of a team, often under pressure, see figure <a href="experiencing.html#fig:budgens-fig">5.9</a>. This is good evidence of the “nice to have around” bit that Jonathan Black refers to <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-topnotchcv" role="doc-biblioref">Black 2019</a>)</span> and is something your formal education will not typically provide much evidence of. So, don’t fall into the trap of discounting the value of casual or part-time labour.</p>

## Excuses, excuses   {#excuses}

When I tell students this, I'm often given an excuses some of which are given below.


### I missed the deadline  {#deadlines}

Stuff

### I'm busy waiting  {#busywaiting}


<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p class="caption">(\#fig:justme-fig)(ref:justme)</p>
</div>
(ref:justme) The biggest waste of time is the time spent being busy waiting, and not making a start. Starting a career by getting some experience can be a daunting project, but don't allow yourself to be held captive by irrational worries about the job market. Once you start a daunting project, you will begin to see it for what it is. The ideas will come and and you won't need to fear it anymore, you may even start to enjoy the process of figuring out what your career options you are most interested in. [New Project?

### I don't know what I want to do  {#noclue}  

I don't know what I want to do

### I don't have any experience  

Stuff


### I do not have the grades  

Whatever you are studying, its easy to fall into a trap of thinking that your grades aren't good enough. While there are some employers who really care about your grades, there are plenty who don't. These employers are more interested in what you're like as a person, so any projects, experience or other activities you've done that demonstrate will help you stand out against rival candidates with better grades.




### I am too busy  

Stuff


### I keep getting rejected  

Stuff


### I am overwhelmed by the choices  

Stuff


### It is too competitive  

Stuff


### All my friends have found jobs already  

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/not-very-good-at-this.png" alt="(ref:captionnotverygood)" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:grades-fig)(ref:captionnotverygood)</p>
</div>

(ref:captionnotverygood) Do you have the grades? Not all employers care about your academic grades because they're only a small part of what you have to offer as an employee.

What have you done


### I didn't get my dream job  

didn't get graduate scheme (look at graduate jobs), missed my dream job at CERN, Google, Facebook etc.
