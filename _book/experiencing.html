</h2>
<p>You are <em>much more</em> than your grades, because your education is only a part of who you are. You are the sum total of your experiences, this is one of the reasons that experience is so valuable, see figure <a href="experiencing#fig:experience-fig">5.3</a>. It’s common for students to be focused on their grades, whether those grades are low, middling or or high. At the extremes, if you have got lower grades than you’d like, you might be anxious or unhappy about them. If you’ve got higher grades, you’re probably focussed on keeping them high. While its important to focus on getting the best grades you can, employers are interested in the whole you rather than narrowly focusing on your academic education. Alongside your academic achievements, there is also your:</p>

<p>Your experience tells a story about who you are, what you’re capable of and what you have learned. Experience is a crucial part of <em>how</em> you learn and allows you to demonstrate <em>what</em> you have learned. Experience makes you more <em>employable</em> which means:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>experience tests and validates what you have already learned, see Sneha’s story in chapter <a href="sneha#sneha">29</a>
</li>
<li>experience motivates you to learn more by helping you decide what to learn next</li>
<li>experience improves your confidence <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-jackiecarter">Carter 2021</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>experience broadens and deepens your skills and knowledge, see figure <a href="exploring#fig:goal-fig">2.1</a>
</li>
<li>experience improves your chances of being invited to interview</li>
<li>experience improves your chances of being offered a job after an interview</li>
<li>experience builds your professional network of contacts, both the stronger and the weaker ties described in section <a href="finding#weakties">11.2.5</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Paul Redmond at the University of Liverpool describes experience as a key part of employability <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-paulredmond">Redmond 2010</a>)</span> as expressed in his graduate jobs formula shown in equation <a href="experiencing#eq:redmond">(5.1)</a>.</p>
<div class="rmdnote">
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:redmond">\[\begin{equation}
  E = Q + WE + S \times C
  \tag{5.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>According to Redmond, your employability (<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>) is the sum of your qualifications (<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>), your work experience (<span class="math inline">\(WE\)</span>) and your strategies (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) multiplied by your contacts (<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>). It is difficult to quantify employability so precisely but Redmond’s equation <a href="experiencing#eq:redmond">(5.1)</a> is a good starting point for discussion. We will look at some strategies</p>
<ul>
<li>For qualifcations (<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>), see section <a href="debugging#mycved">8.6.2</a> on your <code>Education</code>
</li>
<li>For strategies (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) and contacts (<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>) see chapter <a href="finding#finding">11</a> on <em>Finding your Future</em>
</li>
<li>For experience (<span class="math inline">\(WE\)</span>) read on, this chapter is all about your <code>experience</code>

<p>So what counts as <code>experience</code>? I’m going to use experience to mean applying what you’ve learnt in your formal education <em>outside</em> of school or University, this includes but is not limited to, paid employment. Employers use terms to describe jobs and experience for undergraduates and graduates inconsistently. So I’ve defined and outlined terms for relevant kinds of experience shown in table <a href="experiencing#tab:jobterms">5.1</a> and we’ll use these definitions throughout this guidebook.</p>

<p>Some of the experience outlined in table <a href="experiencing#tab:jobterms">5.1</a> was probably what you were already thinking of as experience, however there are four other important sources of experience that students often overlook:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Voluntary work</strong>: Any kind of work where you’ve given your time and labour to a community. That could be non-technical (working for a charity) or technical, such as contributing to open-source software, see section <a href="experiencing#opensource">5.3.5</a> and figure <a href="experiencing#fig:volunthero-fig">5.4</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Casual work</strong>: Working in hospitality or retail (etc) is often overlooked by students as an important source of relevant experience. It doesn’t have to be technical to be relevant to employers, see section <a href="experiencing#casual">5.3.8</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tinkering</strong>: having passion projects as a playground to help you learn new skills and knowledge, either solo or collaboratively see section <a href="experiencing#tinkering">5.3.7</a>. For more competitive employers, passion projects are likely to be more important. To get into ultra-competitive industries like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry">video game industry</a>, candidates are often expected to have a portfolio of one or two games developed <em>outside</em> of University, and these will be more interesting to employers than what (or where) you’ve studied <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-aswift">Hanuk et al. 2022</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Student societies</strong> Your students’ union will have hundreds of official societies you can get involved in, and they’ll be plenty of unofficial fringe communities too. As well as helping you develop new or existing interests, these societies give you an opportunity to serve a particular community of interest. Many societies seek members to take on positions of responsibility, above and beyond merely participating in their events. They provide fantastic opportunities to build new skills in a safe and supportive environment.</li>

<p>Before we discuss these experiences, lets look at some of the more conventional places for getting experience.</p>
<!--* Competitions: participating in competitions and hackathons will make your CV stand out-->

<p>It’s probably easier than you might think to get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">big tech</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_chip_(stock_market)">blue chip name</a> on your CV. For example, many large employers run <a href="https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights">insight days, vacation schemes and spring weeks</a>. These are often aimed at first year undergraduates, and are sometimes less competitive to get into than a longer term commitment such as a summer internship, year-long placement or even graduate job. A big name on your CV early in your degree can help it stand out later, as fluff bucket the grinning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Cat">cheshire cat</a> demonstrates on their CV shown in figure <a href="experiencing#fig:bigname-fig">5.5</a>. 😻</p>

<p>Big names can look good on your CV, but they are not the only way to make your CV stand out.</p>
</div>
<div id="smallnames" class="section level3" number="5.3.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.3.4</span> Smaller name experience<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#smallnames"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><em>Any</em> experience will help your CV stand out. Smaller name employers have the advantage that they tend to be less picky than big household names so it is often easier to get a foot in the door. It might not be what you see yourself doing in the longer term, but the experience and opportunities you gain working in a small company can be invaluable.</p>
<p>To use a footballing analogy, let’s imagine you dream of playing for the world’s greatest football team: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.">Manchester United</a>. Unfortunately, the talent scouts at United don’t return any of your calls or emails about vacancies for younger players and its incredibly hard to get a chance to speak to them in person. However, if you prove yourself at a smaller club, that would be a start. This is how most professional footballers start, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford">Marcus Rashford</a> shown in figure <a href="experiencing#fig:rashford-fig">5.7</a>. What works in football can also work in employment too. You might even decide that big clubs are over-rated and you prefer playing for smaller clubs anyway <em>or</em> a smaller employer could be your stepping stone to bigger things. Of course, you want to be ambitious and find what is best for you but ignoring opportunities with smaller employers will severely restrict your options. At the very least, small name experience will get some evidence on your CV and start to buid your professional network.</p>

<p>There are lots of different motivations for getting involved in open source, shown in figure <a href="experiencing#fig:opensource-fig">5.9</a>. Whatever your motivation, contributing to open source software is fun, you’ll learn heaps and it will look <em>great</em> on your CV. Open source software is widely used by, so contributing is a great way to get some real world experience of software development.

<p>If you’re looking for a project to get stuck into, here are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diomidis_Spinellis">Diomidis Spinellis</a> tips for getting started <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-sigman18">Spinellis 2021</a>)</span>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose a project with several active contributors, so that there is a community to help you</li>
<li>Choose a relatively popular project (with some GitHub stars) so that you can avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware">abandonware</a> but…</li>
<li>… Avoid “blockbuster” projects like <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow">tensorflow</a> or <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">vscode</a> , so that your contributions will not get lost in the politics and bureaucracy of a large project</li>
<li>Verify that you can build and run the project from your own setup</li>
<li>Ensure the project regularly accepts pull requests from outsiders, so that your contributions will have a chance of being accepted</li>
<li>Contribute a trivial fix to start with to test your ability use the project’s workflows</li>
</ol>
<p>The guidelines for prospective contributors to Google’s Summer of Code (GSoC) at <a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/">google.github.io/gsocguides/student</a> go into more depth about how you can get involved in open source software development.

<p>Experience as a section on your CV usually means <em>paid</em> work. However, experience in the context of this chapter means anything where you can show you’ve been part of a bigger team, taken responsibility for something or tried to make the world a better place somehow. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteering: Doing voluntary work is a good way to pick up new skills</li>

<li>Getting involved in a community, either physical or online</li>

<p>Another good source of experience is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker">tinkering</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture">hacking</a>. Hackers and tinkerers improve or repair things in their spare time for fun, either as passion projects or in collaboration with others. For example, why not build an experimental:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hackable burglar alarm?<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;hackable by you, not the burglars, obvs&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a>

<p>Yes, these projects are amateur, but tinkering and hacking clearly demonstrates your passion for learning and engineering. Apart from being fun, weekend hacks can look <em>great</em> in the <code>projects</code> section of your CV, see section <a href="debugging#mycvpj">8.6.4</a>.</p>

<p>Attending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">Hackathons</a> is another way to learn and gain <code>experience</code> by tinkering, in a collaborative and social environment, see figure <a href="experiencing#fig:hackathon-fig">5.10</a>. The word hackathon is a portmanteau of hacking (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture">hacker culture</a> not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker">security hacking</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon">marathon</a>. Hackathons tend to be short (24 to 48 hours) but intense, see for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.hackathons.org.uk/">hackathons.org.uk</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://greatunihack.com/">greatunihack.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.studenthack.com/">studenthack.com</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://codeforces.com/">codeforces.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://devpost.com/hackathons">devpost.com/hackathons</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://mlh.io/">mlh.io</a> (Major League Hacking)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/">hackerearth.com</a> <!--more like hackerrank than an event?-->
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackzurich.com/">hackzurich.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside these competitions, there are other hackathon-type events which are organised by a single employer, see section <a href="experiencing#bignames">5.3.3</a>. There are also opportunities to build your technical experience by practicing coding interviews online such as hackerrank and leetcode, described in section <a href="speaking#codinginterview">13.2.3</a>.</p>
<p>Passion projects like these help to distinguish you from your peers, but they don’t <em>have</em> to be technical, see section <a href="experiencing#casual">5.3.8</a> and <a href="experiencing#volunteering">5.3.6</a>. You might feel that you are too busy to do any passion projects, but if working hard on academic study and getting top grades means that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neglect hobbies, interests and friends</li>
<li>Start to suffer from anxiety or depression</li>
<li>Only have <code>projects</code> that were a compulsory part of your formal education</li>
</ul>
<p>It might be time to reflect and consider re-balancing your priorities if you can.</p>

<p>You may already have experience of paid employment as a casual or part-time worker. This could include jobs such as waiting tables, serving in a bar or working in other areas of hospitality or retail, for example as a Saturday job.</p>

<p>It is important to recognise that these jobs have value. Many students make the mistake of overlooking their casual work experience because they discount it as non-technical and “low-skilled”. In section <a href="debugging#mycvst">8.6</a> we saw that one of the stories you want to tell in your job applications is that you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>take responsibility</li>
<li>achieve things</li>
<li>are nice to have around</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing casual work can demonstrate all of these things. For example, from the ages of 12 to 18 I was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy">paperboy</a>, except unlike the Titanic paperboy selling newspapers in the street in figure <a href="experiencing#fig:paperboy-fig">5.11</a>, I delivered newspapers directly to the doors of paying customers every morning. This was not a particularly highly skilled job, but it <em>does</em> demonstrate:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_ethic">work ethic</a>: getting up early <em>every</em> morning (including Saturdays). Sometimes work is about just turning up everyday!</li>
<li>taking responsibility and being reliable</li>
<li>understanding the value of money by earning a wage</li>
</ol>
<!-- this is repetitive, see earlier in the section--><p>I’ve often spoken to students who neglect to tell me about their paid work in retail or hospitality. “But it’s not technical” they say, “it’s low skilled and irrelevant”. However, serving customers demonstrates your ability to provide good customer service and work as part of a team, often under pressure, see figure <a href="experiencing#fig:budgens-fig">5.12</a>. This is good evidence of the “nice to have around” bit that Jonathan Black refers to <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-topnotchcv">Jonathan Black 2019b</a>)</span> and is something your formal education will not typically provide much evidence of. So, don’t fall into the trap of discounting the value of casual or part-time labour.</p>

<p>Too long, didn’t read (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read">TL;DR</a>)? Here’s a summary:</p>
<p>Your future is bright, your future needs experiencing. Experiencing your future will help you design your future. Designing your future will help you to start coding your future.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you have reflected on what your experience is to date, not just the paid experience but all your other experiences that prospective employers will care about. If you feel like you don’t have much experience, we’ve outlined actions you can take to do something about it.</p>
<p>In the next part, chapter <a href="choosing#choosing">6</a>: <em>Choosing your Future</em>, we’ll look at roles you might interested in for paid experience. What are the possibilities, and how are you going to decide between them?</p>
<p>This chapter is under construction because I’m using agile book development methods, see figure <a href="experiencing#fig:deathstar2-fig">5.13</a>.</p>
