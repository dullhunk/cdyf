<p>It’s common for students to be focused on their grades, whether those grades are low, middling or or high. At the extremes, if you have got lower grades than you’d like, you might be anxious or unhappy about them. If you’ve got higher grades, you’re probably focussed on keeping them high. Either way, you are <em>much more</em> than your grades, because your education is only a part of who you are. You are the sum total of your experiences, this is one of the reasons that experience is so valuable, see figure <a href="experiencing#fig:experience-fig">5.3</a></p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p>Your experience tells a story about who you are, what you’re capable of and what you have learned. Experience is a crucial part of <em>how</em> you learn and allows you to demonstrate <em>what</em> you have learned. Experience makes you more <em>employable</em> which means:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>experience validates what you have already learned, see Sneha’s story in chapter <a href="sneha#sneha">25</a>
</li>
<li>experience motivates you to learn more by helping you decide what to learn next</li>
<li>experience improves your confidence <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-jackiecarter" role="doc-biblioref">Carter 2021</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>experience broadens and deepens your skills and knowledge, see figure <a href="knowing#fig:goal-fig">2.1</a>
</li>
<li>experience improves your chances of being invited to interview</li>
<li>experience improves your chances of being offered a job after an interview</li>
<li>experience builds your professional network of contacts, particuarly the crucial weaker ties described in section <a href="finding#weakties">8.2.5</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Paul Redmond at the University of Liverpool describes experience as a key part of employability <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-paulredmond" role="doc-biblioref">Redmond 2010</a>)</span> as expressed in his graduate jobs formula shown in equation <a href="experiencing#eq:redmond">(5.1)</a>.</p>
<div class="rmdnote">
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:redmond">\[\begin{equation}
  E = Q + WE + S \times C
  \tag{5.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>According to Redmond, your employability (<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>) is the sum of your qualifications (<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>), your work experience (<span class="math inline">\(WE\)</span>) and your strategies (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) multiplied by your contacts (<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>). It is difficult to quantify employability so precisely but Redmond’s equation <a href="experiencing#eq:redmond">(5.1)</a> is a good starting point for discussion. We will look at some strategies</p>
<ul>
<li>For qualifcations (<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>), see section <a href="debugging#mycved">7.6.2</a> on your <code>Education</code>
</li>
<li>For strategies (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) and contacts (<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>) see chapter <a href="finding#finding">8</a> on <em>Finding your Future</em>
</li>
<li>For experience (<span class="math inline">\(WE\)</span>) read on, this chapter is all about your <code>experience</code>

<p>So what counts as <code>experience</code>? I’m going to use experience to mean applying what you’ve learnt in your formal education outside of school or University, this includes but its not limited to, paid work. Employers use terms to describe jobs and experience for undergraduates and graduates inconsistently. So I’ve defined and outlined terms for relevant kinds of experience shown in table <a href="experiencing#tab:jobterms">5.1</a> and we’ll use these definitions throughout the book.</p>

<!-- to do compare and contrast summer vs year long-->
<p>Some of the experience outlined in table <a href="experiencing#tab:jobterms">5.1</a> was probably what you were already thinking of as experience, however there are three important sources of experience that students often overlook:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Voluntary work</strong>: Any kind of work where you’ve given your time and labour to a community. That could be non-technical (working for a charity) or technical, such as contributing to open-source software, see section <a href="experiencing#opensource">5.3.4</a> and figure <a href="experiencing#fig:volunthero-fig">5.4</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Casual work</strong>: Working in hospitality or retail (etc) is often overlooked by students as an important source of relevant experience. It doesn’t have to be technical to be relevant to employers, see section <a href="experiencing#casual">5.3.7</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tinkering</strong>: having side projects as a playground to help you learn new skills and knowledge, either solo or collaboratively see section <a href="experiencing#tinkering">5.3.6</a>. For more competitive employers, side projects are likely to be more important. To get into ultra-competitive industries like gaming, candidates are often expected to have a portfolio of one or two games developed outside of University</li>
<li>
<strong>Student societies</strong> Your students’ union will have hundreds of official societies you can get involved in, and they’ll be plenty of unofficial fringe communities too. As well as helping you develop new or existing interests, these societies give you an opportunity to serve a particular community of interest. Many societies seek members to take on positions of responsibility, above and beyond merely participating in their events. They provide fantastic opportunities to build new skills in a safe and supportive environment.</li>

<p>Before we discuss these experiences, lets look at some of the more conventional places for getting experience:</p>
<!--* Competitions: participating in competitions and hackathons will make your CV stand out-->

</h3>
<p>It’s probably easier than you might think to get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">big tech</a> or big employer name on your CV. For example, many large employers run <a href="https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights">insight days, vacation schemes and spring weeks</a>. These are often aimed at first year undergraduates, and are sometimes less competitive to get into than a longer term commitment such as a summer internship, year-long placement or even graduate job. A big name on your CV early in your degree can help it stand out later, as fluff bucket the grinning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Cat">cheshire cat</a> demonstrates on their CV shown in figure <a href="experiencing#fig:bigname-fig">5.5</a>. 😻</p>

<p>Any experience will help your CV stand out. Smaller employers have the advantage that they tend to be less picky than big names so it is often easier to get a foot in the door. It might not be what you see yourself doing for long, but the experience gained in a small company can be invaluable. You might even prefer working in a small company to a big corporation or conglomeration.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.3.4</span> Open source experience<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#opensource"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Open source software projects are a great way to get some solid experience of software engineering, see for example <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/7/253459-why-computing-students-should-contribute-to-open-source-software-projects/fulltext">Why Computing Students Should Contribute to Open Source Software Projects</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-sigman18" role="doc-biblioref">Spinellis 2021</a>)</span> There’s two ways to get started:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Raise a new issue via the project’s issue tracker, such as <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">github issues</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-githubissues" role="doc-biblioref">Octocat 2020</a>)</span>

See <a href="https://firstcontributions.github.io/">firstcontributions.github.io</a> and the <code>&lt;good first issue&gt;</code> tag which helps new contributors identify starting points, see <a href="https://goodfirstissue.dev/">goodfirstissue.dev</a> for some aggregated examples.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are lots of different motivations for getting involved in open source, shown in figure <a href="experiencing#fig:opensource-fig">5.7</a>. Whatever your motivation, contributing to open source software is fun, you’ll learn heaps and it will look <em>great</em> on your CV. Open source software is widely used by, so contributing is a great way to get some real world experience of software development. Many open source projects are funded by employers both large and small, and you can get paid to develop open source software through projects like Google’s Summer of Code. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-gsoc" role="doc-biblioref">Googler 2022</a>)</span></p>

<p>If you’re looking for a project to get stuck into, here are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diomidis_Spinellis">Diomidis Spinellis</a> tips for getting started <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-sigman18" role="doc-biblioref">Spinellis 2021</a>)</span>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose a project with several active contributors, so that there is a community to help you</li>
<li>Choose a relatively popular project (with some GitHub stars) so that you can avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware">abandonware</a> but…</li>
<li>… Avoid “blockbuster” projects like <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow">tensorflow</a> or <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">vscode</a> , so that your contributions will not get lost in the politics and bureaucracy of a large project</li>
<li>Verify that you can build and run the project from your own setup</li>
<li>Ensure the project regularly accepts pull requests from outsiders, so that your contributions will have a chance of being accepted</li>
<li>Contribute a trivial fix to start with to test your ability use the project’s workflows</li>
</ol>
<p>The guidelines for prospective contributors to Google’s Summer of Code (GSoC) at <a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/">google.github.io/gsocguides/student</a> go into more depth about how you can get involved in open source software development. Many of these general guidelines apply both inside (paid) and outside (unpaid) of GSoC. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-gsoc" role="doc-biblioref">Googler 2022</a>)</span></p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.3.5</span> Voluntary experience<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#volunteering"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Experience as a section of your CV usually means <em>paid</em> work. However, experience in the context of this chapter means anything where you can show you’ve been part of a bigger team, taken responsibility for something or tried to make the world a better place somehow. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteering: Doing voluntary work is a good way to pick up new skills</li>
<li>Being involved in societies: e.g. taking responsibility for things in a society</li>
<li>Getting involved in a community, either physical or online</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.3.6</span> Hacking &amp; tinkering experience<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tinkering"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Another good source of experience is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker">tinkering</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture">hacking</a>. Hackers and tinkerers improve or repair things in their spare time for fun, either as a solo project or collaboratively. For example, why not build an experimental:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home media centre?</li>
<li>DIY smart energy meter?</li>
<li>Plant watering system for when you go on holiday?</li>
<li>See also <a href="https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x">github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x</a> for inspiration</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, these projects are amateurish, but tinkering and hacking will clearly demonstrate your passion for learning and engineering. Weekend hacks can look <em>great</em> in the <code>projects</code> section of your CV, see section <a href="debugging#mycvpj">7.6.4</a>.</p>

<p>Attending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">Hackathons</a> is another way to learn and gain <code>experience</code> by tinkering, in a collaborative and social environment, see figure <a href="experiencing#fig:hackathon-fig">5.8</a>. The word hackathon is a portmanteau of hacking from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture">hacker culture</a> (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker">security hacking</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon">marathon</a>. Hackathons tend to be short (24 to 48 hours) but intense, see for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.hackathons.org.uk/">hackathons.org.uk</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://greatunihack.com/">greatunihack.com</a></li>

</li>
<li><a href="https://hackzurich.com/">hackzurich.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside these competitions, there are other hackathon-type events which are organised by a single employer, see section <a href="experiencing#bignames">5.3.2</a>. There are also opportunities to build your technical experience by practicing coding interviews online such as hackerrank and leetcode, described in section <a href="speaking#codinginterview">10.2.3</a>.</p>
<p>Side projects like these help to distinguish you from your peers, but they don’t <em>have</em> to be technical, see section <a href="experiencing#casual">5.3.7</a> and <a href="experiencing#volunteering">5.3.5</a>. You might feel that you are too busy to do any side projects, but if working hard on academic study and getting top grades means that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neglect hobbies, interests and friends</li>
<li>Start to suffer from anxiety or depression</li>
<li>Only have <code>projects</code> that were a compulsory part of your formal education</li>
</ul>
<p>It might be time to reflect and consider re-balancing your priorities if you can.</p>

<p>You may already have experience of paid employment as a casual or part-time worker. This could include jobs such as waiting tables, serving in a bar or working in other areas of hospitality or retail, for example as a Saturday job.</p>

<p>It is important to recognise that these jobs have value. Many students make the mistake of overlooking their casual work experience because they discount it as non-technical and “low-skilled”. In section <a href="debugging#mycvst">7.6</a> we saw that one of the stories you want to tell in your job applications is that you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>take responsibility</li>
<li>achieve things</li>
<li>are nice to have around</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing casual work can demonstrate all of these things. For example, from the ages of 12 to 18 I was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy">paperboy</a>, except unlike the Titanic paperboy selling newspapers in the street in figure <a href="experiencing#fig:paperboy-fig">5.9</a>, I delivered newspapers directly to the doors of paying customers every morning. This was not a particularly highly skilled job, but it <em>does</em> demonstrate:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_ethic">work ethic</a>: getting up early <em>every</em> morning (including Saturdays). Sometimes work is about just turning up everyday!</li>
<li>taking responsibility and being reliable</li>
<li>understanding the value of money by earning a wage</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve often spoken to students who neglect to tell me about their paid work in retail or hospitality. “But it’s not technical” they say, “it’s low skilled and irrelevant”. However, serving customers demonstrates your ability to provide good customer service and work as part of a team, often under pressure, see figure <a href="experiencing#fig:budgens-fig">5.10</a>. This is good evidence of the “nice to have around” bit that Jonathan Black refers to <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-topnotchcv" role="doc-biblioref">J. Black 2019b</a>)</span> and is something your formal education will not typically provide much evidence of. So, don’t fall into the trap of discounting the value of casual or part-time labour.</p>
