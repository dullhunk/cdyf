<p>The first half of this book is about designing your future. So before we get started, let‚Äôs tackle a fundamental design issue. Why the hell should you bother reading this guidebook?</p>
<ul>
<li>you are a busy person, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è</li>
<li>your time is a precious and finite resource, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è</li>
<li>you could be spending that precious time right now in lots of other ways, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è</li>
<li>there are mountains of self-help guides and courses already, YES! ‚òëÔ∏è</li>
<li>do you really need <em>yet another</em> guidebook? YES! ‚òëÔ∏è</li>
</ul>
<p>You need this guidebook because it is different to all the other guidebooks! It will help you design, test, build and code your future in computing.

What she discovers is a strange underground world populated by weird and wonderful characters. The world of work can sometimes be a mysterious underworld where you adventure in wonderland accompanied by colourful characters.</p>

</h2>
<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Stanford-Clark">Andy Stanford-Clark</a> started working at IBM, fresh out of University, his boss gave him the following advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúNobody cares about your career except you.‚Äù ‚ÄîAnon <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-andystanfordclark" role="doc-biblioref">Stanford-Clark 2019</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andy is now Master Inventor and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at IBM in the UK so it was probably good advice. Another, slightly more positive way of putting the advice is, the person who cares <em>most</em> about your career is you. So while there are people who can help design and build your future, ultimately it is <strong>YOU</strong> who has to take responsibility for the implementation (if you like, the code). The sooner you get coding the better.</p>
<p>At University, there are lots of people can help design and build your future: peers, academic staff, friends, your careers service, employers and your wider network but ultimately it is <em>your</em> responsibility to sort out whatever comes next. That might sound obvious but don‚Äôt wait for somebody else to do it for you, because it probably won‚Äôt happen.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Your degree is not enough<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#entitled"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>You‚Äôve worked incredibly hard to get the grades you needed to get into University. You‚Äôve spent (or are spending) a significant amount of time and money studying whatever it is you are studying at University.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, you might be tempted to believe that the world owes you something in return for your hard work. Unfortunately that‚Äôs not the case.</p>
<p>At some point during or after your study, you might find yourself applying for a graduate job or graduate scheme. EVERYONE applying for these opportunities will have a degree or be rapidly on their way to getting one. So having a degree isn‚Äôt going to set you apart much from your competition. Even having a first class degree <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-gradeinflation" role="doc-biblioref">Coughlan 2019a</a>; <a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-firstclass" role="doc-biblioref">Borrett 2019</a>)</span> may not distinguish you that much your competitors. Some employers would rather not know (or don‚Äôt care) what University you went to, so your education might not make you stand out as much as you might like anyway. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-bigfour" role="doc-biblioref">Agnew 2016</a>)</span></p>
<p>What <strong>will</strong> distinguish you from your competitors will be your <a href="experiencing.html">experience</a>, your projects, your <a href="communicating.html">communication skills</a> and any awards or honours you might have picked up along the way. If you think that your degree will be enough to get you the job you want, bear in mind that:</p>

<p>Now, don‚Äôt be disillusioned by the statistics because a degree can open doors to many careers in computing. What the data in Figure <a href="bothering.html#fig:lotsofgrads-fig">1.2</a> show is that you‚Äôll need to look beyond your formal education to distinguish yourself from your competition. Your degree can certainly help you start a career, but it is typically not enough by itself.</p>

<p>Studying at University is a significant investment of your time and money. Hopefully, you‚Äôve picked a subject that stimulates and challenges you intellectually while allowing you to find and develop your unique talents. But there‚Äôs another reason that you probably chose to study at University and that was to improve your job prospects. This guidebook will:</p>

<li>Highlight and review essential resources beyond this guidebook that will help with the above</li>

<p>All of the resources that can help you are scattered around in lots of different places. There are books, there are videos, there are podcasts, there are websites and jobs boards.

<p>You might be tempted to postpone making difficult career decisions. I‚Äôll do it tomorrow. I‚Äôll do it next week. I‚Äôll do it next year. I‚Äôll finish this assignment. I‚Äôll finish this exam. I‚Äôll finish this semester.

<p>It probably doesn‚Äôt help that many of issues described and discussed in this book are typically not closely integrated into the curriculum in Higher Education. You‚Äôll often find them on the edges, or completely outside of, standard University curricula. Broadly speaking, the professional issues described in this book are usually covered by pastoral support systems, counselling services, careers services, trade organisations, professional bodies, student unions and their societies,.</p>
<p>Despite being sidelined, these issues matter and it is in your own selfish interests to start thinking about them right now. According to recent estimates by <em>Investors in People</em>, the average person spends <strong>80,000 hours</strong> working during their lifetime. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-iip2" role="doc-biblioref">Investor 2020</a>)</span> So, <em>whatever</em> you end up doing after University, you‚Äôll be spending a lot of time doing it. Difficult decisions often get sidelined but it is never too early to start thinking about them and doing something. The sooner you start thinking about them the better decisions you‚Äôll make about what comes next. It‚Äôs too late when you graduate.</p>
<p>That doesn‚Äôt mean you have to know EXACTLY what you want to do when you finish. Lots of students don‚Äôt and I certainly didn‚Äôt when I graduated. I‚Äôd done a gap year teaching in India, two summer internships (in Sweden and the United States) and a year-in-industry in the UK and I <em>still</em> graduated with <strong>no clue</strong> as to what I wanted to do next! The important thing is that you make a start, and sometimes knowing what you <strong>don‚Äôt</strong> want to do is just as valuable as knowing what you do.</p>

<p>Students love to ask their teachers ‚Äú<em>will this be on the exam</em>?‚Äù The short answer is <strong>YES</strong> (and <strong>NO</strong>)! Yes, this will be on the exam, but NO the exam won‚Äôt be set by your University. Unlike other courses you‚Äôve done, the examinations for this course aren‚Äôt set by your University but by employers.

<p>So, <em>yes</em>, this will be on the exam, but <em>no</em>, the exams are obviously not set, administered, invigilated and marked by academics at your University. The exams are set by employers and the results are <strong>brutally binary</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>PASS</strong>: you‚Äôve got the interview, job or promotion or‚Ä¶</li>
<li>
<strong>FAIL</strong>: none of the above. Next!</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the challenging things about employers exams are, they typically do not have the bandwidth to give applicants useful feedback, other than a simple pass or fail. When it comes to job applications software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell">Gayle Laakmann McDowell</a> calls this the ‚Äúblack hole.‚Äù The gravitational force of employers black holes is so strong that no CV or Resume can escape, we‚Äôll say more about this in chapter on <a href="debugging.html#debugging">debugging your CV</a>.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.11</span> This book is different<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#thinkdifferent"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I wrote this guidebook because I needed a resource for students to help them design, build, test and debug their futures. I wanted a single resource that could help students compete for jobs while at University, or shortly after graduating. I could not find anything suitable that met all the requirements of the students I was teaching. So I wrote this one which contains some new material and recommends the best resources if you want to know more. These are found in the signposts sections of each chapter.</p>
<!--Good though these many resources are, they all have their own limitations. Some have dated quickly and are not refreshed, others are published under a restrictive copyright licenses that can prevent reuse, sharing and access. Some resources only tackle a single issue, while many can't easily be adapted for your own needs. -->
<!--Others neglect the student voice or fail to tell the story of students with first-hand experience of a rapidly changing and sometimes brutally competitive job market. Many are written from the point of view of employers, recruiters or careers advisors [@samfranklin]. These people all have valuable advice for students but they often lack first hand experience of working in a given sector and in some cases are trying sell you something! Another common shortcoming is excluding all parts of the story which combine four overlapping perspectives:

1. Students and recent graduates
1. Employers and recruiters
1. Careers advisors, authors and journalists
1. Scientists and engineers, in industry and academia-->
<p>This book aims to combine these perspectives and to be different from existing resources in the following ways:</p>
<div id="signposted" class="section level3" number="1.11.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.11.1</span> Well signposted<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#signposted"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Some career resources claim (or imply) that they are the <em>all you will need</em> to solve a particular problem or worse: solve <em>all of your problems</em>! Just buy this book, do this course, watch this video, listen to this podcast and all your problems will go away! Rather than continue this trend, this book <strong>signposts</strong> some of the most useful resources. <!--We don't want to re-invent the wheel but signpost useful wheels that other people have already made. --></p>
<p>Scientists call this <strong>citation</strong>, rather than signposting. I‚Äôve signposted and cited sources in this guidebook so that you can :</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Check and verify any facts and claims I make in this book for yourself</li>
<li>Go and consult the original sources if you think they might be useful</li>
</ol>
<p>While this guidebook cites lots of resources, some of them are more important than others. Each chapter summarises these in a signposts section. You‚Äôll find everything else in the <a href="#referencing">references</a> section. The University of Manchester has physical and electronic copies of many (but sadly not all) of the books listed here.</p>
<!--If you're studying at the University of Manchester, these signposts are available as a library reading list at [library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/reading-lists](https://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/reading-lists).-->
<p>We‚Äôre not suggesting that you read <em>all</em> these books right now, but that if a particular chapter has piqued your interest, these signposts are good places to keep going, if you haven‚Äôt already read them. I hope you‚Äôll find these signposts handy for navigating the mountains of advice. Not all who wander are lost. üó∫Ô∏èüß≠</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.11.2</span> Your future guidebook<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#study"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This guidebook to your future accompanies a course that has been co-designed by students for students, with input from academics and employers. It unites several disparate themes into one coherent story, from fundamental questions about identity and wellbeing through to more applied and practical advice on job hunting, career progression and life after University. Resources that do this are typically scattered around in many different places. There is usually no narrative to tie them all together to help students navigate the mountains of advice as embark on the first stages of their careers.</p>
<p>Although this is a course guidebook used in the second year undergraduate teaching, you don‚Äôt need to be enrolled on the course to benefit from reading it, watching the videos and doing the exercises and coding challenges.</p>

<p>A lot of scientific and technical writing is written in the third person or passive voice, which is fine for academic writing, but can alienate readers.

</h2>
<p>Each chapter in this book has a signposts section, highlighting key activities or reading you can do from here. This chapter has addressed the question of <strong>why should you bother coding your future</strong>? The answer is that your future is your responsibility and no-one elses. There are lots of people can help shape your future, but none more than yourself. Software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin">Robert C. Martin</a> argues this point in his book <em>The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</em>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-cleancoder" role="doc-biblioref">Martin 2011</a>)</span></p>
<p>What‚Äôs good about <em>The Clean Coder</em> is that it is short (only 200 pages), well written and to the point. The main part of the book covers professional issues in software engineering, some of which I discuss in <a href="surviving.html#surviving">your survival and promotion</a>, so <em>The Clean Coder</em> is an essential signpost for chapter 10 as well.</p>
