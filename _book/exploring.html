<!-- this doesn't really fit or flow here, what's the connection between education, identity and self-knowlege -->
<p>Your identity, who you are, is complex, dynamic and high-dimensional so you will need to experiment with several different techniques to improve your self-awareness. Here are seven techniques to get you started exploring who you are:</p>
<!-- Your education is a big part of your identity so being conscious of how your education has already changed you is an important step in developing self-awareness. Identifying what your formal education *can't* do for you, is just as crucial too. Before we look at some techniques for improving your self-awareness, let's look at the fundamental *protected* parts of your identity. Some parts of your identity are so important that they are protected by legislation, in the UK and in other countries. -->
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>🔒 your protected characteristics, see section <a href="exploring#protected">2.2.1</a>
</li>
<li>📕 your story so far, see section <a href="exploring#story">2.2.2</a>
</li>
<li>🙂 your head, heart and hands, see section <a href="exploring#hhh">2.2.3</a>
</li>
<li>🤔 your reason for being (ikigai), see section <a href="exploring#no42">2.2.4</a>

<li>📊 your personality profile, see section <a href="exploring#personality">2.2.5</a>

<li>☠️ your deathbed <em>thought experiment</em>, see section <a href="exploring#regrets">2.2.7</a>

</ol>
<!--being aware of what your formal education can, and can't do for you is key to being more self-ware--><div id="protected" class="section level3" number="2.2.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Your protected characteristics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#protected"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Some of your identity includes characteristics that are protected. In the UK, the Equality Act of 2010<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> protects you from discrimination at work or in education, based on what are known as “protected characteristics”. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-equality">Servant 2020a</a>)</span>. This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>age</strong> should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>disabilities</strong> should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>gender</strong> should not determine how you are treated <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-inferior">Saini 2018</a>; <a href="reading#ref-damore">Damore 2017</a>; <a href="reading#ref-damoreguardian">Lewis 2017</a>; <a href="reading#ref-everydaysexism">Bates 2016</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>Your <strong>gender re-assignment</strong> should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>marriage</strong> or civil partnership should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>pregnancy</strong> and maternity should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>race</strong> (including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin) should not determine how you are treated <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-nottalking">Eddo-Lodge 2017</a>; <a href="reading#ref-superior">Saini 2019</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>Your <strong>religion</strong> or beliefs should not determine how you are treated</li>
<li>Your <strong>sex</strong> should not determine how you are treated <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-harassment">Price 2019</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>Your <strong>sexual orientation</strong> should not determine how you are treated <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-nosex">B. Britton 2019</a>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are a special part of your identity because they are protected. This means they shouldn’t be a factor in apply for a job or a subject for discussion in a job interview. Let’s look at gender, sex and sexual orientation in more detail because they can be easily misunderstood. One way to understand gender better is to break it down into four characteristics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Identity</strong>: your gender identity</li>
<li>
<strong>Expression</strong>: your gender expression</li>
<li>
<strong>Sex</strong>: your biological sex</li>
<li>
<strong>Attraction</strong>: your sexual and romantic orientation</li>
</ol>
<p>These protected characteristics are often conflated, because people tend to confuse gender, sex and sexual orientation. They are <em>not</em> the same thing as shown in equation <a href="exploring#eq:gender">(2.1)</a></p>
<div class="rmdnote">
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:gender">\[\begin{equation}
Identity ≠ Expression ≠ Sex ≠ Attraction
  \tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Lets have a look at each of those in turn:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Identity</strong> 🧠 is who you know yourself to be in your own head. Gender identity is based on how much you align (or don’t align) with the options for gender based on your psychological sense of self. This includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>
<code>Woman | Genderqueer | Man</code> see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Expression</strong> 🎨 is how you demonstrate your gender based on gender roles through the ways that you act, dress, behave and interact. These are not exclusive categories, you might choose to express yourself in all three ways including:
<ul>
<li>
<code>Feminine | Androgynous | Masculine</code> see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Sex</strong> ⚧️ is often conflated with gender. Sometimes called anatomical sex or physical sex, your biological sex is objectively measurable using features such as your genitalia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome">chromosomes</a> (your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-determination_system">sex-determination system</a> <code>XX</code>, <code>XY</code> etc), hormones, body hair, ovaries and testes. Your biological sex includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>
<code>Female | Intersex | Male</code> see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Attraction</strong> ❤️ is who you are physically, spiritually and emotionally attracted to. Like biological sex, sexual orientation is often conflated with gender but isn’t always a component of gender. We categorise the attraction we experience in gendered ways. Your sexual orientation includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>
<code>Asexual | Heterosexual | Bisexual | Homosexual</code> see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These characteristics are summarised in the genderbread person shown in figure <a href="exploring#fig:genderbread-fig">2.3</a></p>

<p>The protected characteristics described above are the part of your story you’ll be most aware of. But there’s much more to your story than these characteristics. We’re hardwired to love storytelling because it helps us understand the world around us, see figure <a href="exploring#fig:storytelling-fig">2.4</a>.

<p>Self-awareness, understanding who you are, is important for leading a healthy and happy life, and likely to be an important factor in your future success. One way to develop better self-awareness is to think about the finer details of your story. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-freeyourstory">Box and Mocine-McQueen 2019</a>)</span></p>

<li>How did you get here?</li>

<li>Who is the authentic you? <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-regrets">Ware 2011</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>What are your hopes and dreams?</li>
</ul>
<p>By starting to answer these (admittedly <strong>BIG!</strong>) questions you will gain a better understanding of who you are. This includes your strengths, weaknesses, motivation and values. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-parachute2020">Bolles 2019</a>)</span> Your story is complex but you need to know it so you can distil the details into <em>much</em> shorter stories on your job applications described in section <a href="debugging#structure">8.6</a>. Crucial parts of your story are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Characters</strong>: <em>Who</em> are the key people who have influenced your story so far?</li>
<li>
<strong>Settings</strong>: <em>Where</em> and <em>when</em> have your stories taken place?</li>
<li>
<strong>Conflict and change</strong>: Education means bettering yourself which inevitably involves change so:
<ul>
<li>
<em>How</em> have your experiences changed you?</li>
<li>
<em>What</em> did you learn from these experiences?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Emotions</strong>: how did you <em>feel</em> at the time? Fearful, happy, excited, surprised, empowered? Looking back, how do you feel about these stories now? Have your feelings changed and if so, why?</li>
</ul>
<!-- give example and worksheet--><p>Write these stories down. By reflecting on them and articulating them, you will improve your self awareness. Ultimately, some of these stories can eventually be distilled down into content on your CV (with emotions edited out!), see section <a href="debugging#care">8.6.7</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the learning outcomes described above are non-trivial. You may have good self-awareness and be able to describe aspects of who you are in a matter of minutes.

<p>One of the things you’ll probably want to do is reflect on your life and wonder:</p>

<li>What did you achieve?</li>
<li>Do you have any regrets, if so what are they?</li>

</h3>
<p>A useful technique for developing self-awareness is to think about what your story is. Heather Box and Julian Mocine-McQueen’s book <em>How Your Story Sets You Free</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-freeyourstory">Box and Mocine-McQueen 2019</a>)</span> takes a storytelling approach to help you gain a better picture of who you are and what you value. What’s good about this book is its short, less than 100 pages and contains practical exercises which extend those in this chapter.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.4.4</span> Check your privileges<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#privileged"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Reflecting on your identity should lead you to check any privileges you might have. Being grateful for any privileges you may have is also beneficial for your mental health which we talk about in chapter <a href="nurturing#nurturing">3</a> so:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>If you are white</strong> a good place to start understanding your white privileges is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_I'm_No_Longer_Talking_to_White_People_About_Race">Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race</a></em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reni_Eddo-Lodge">Reni Eddo Lodge</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-nottalking">Eddo-Lodge 2017</a>)</span> and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior:_The_Return_of_Race_Science">Superior: The Return of Race Science</a></em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Saini">Angela Saini</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If you are male</strong> a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of being a man is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_(book)">Inferior</a></em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Saini">Angela Saini</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-inferior">Saini 2018</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If you are socially privileged</strong> a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of your class is <em>The Class Ceiling: Why it Pays to be Privileged</em> by Sam Friedman and Daniel Laurison <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-classceiling">Friedman and Laurison 2020</a>)</span>.
<ul>
<li>If you were privately (or selectively) educated in Britain (or elsewhere) you should read <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engines_of_Privilege">Engines of Privilege: Britain’s Private School Problem</a></em> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-nicebutdim">Green and Kynaston 2019</a>)</span> or <em>Posh Boys</em> by Robert Verkaik <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-poshboys">Verkaik 2019</a>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If you are heterosexual</strong> a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of your sexual orientation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Britton">Ben Britton</a>’s presentation on <em>No sexuality please, we’re scientists</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-nosex">B. Britton 2019</a>)</span> which covers bisexuality and homosexuality, including lesbian and gay homosexuality</li>
<li>
<strong>If you are gender binary</strong> a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary">gender binary</a> is Ben Britton’s presentation <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-nosex">B. Britton 2019</a>)</span> which also covers transgender, genderqueer, non-binary and plus identities.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you got to where you are purely because of your talents, think again: there’s good evidence to show that luck plays a much bigger role than many of us would like to imagine. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-luckynottalented">Pluchino, Biondo, and Rapisarda 2018</a>)</span> Luck is as much a part of your identity as your talents.</p>
<p>There is a lot more to your identity than your race, class, gender and sexual orientation, see your protected characteristics in section <a href="exploring#protected">2.2.1</a>.</p>

<p>Too long, didn’t read (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read">TL;DR</a>)? Here’s a summary:</p>
<p>Your future is bright, your future needs exploring. Exploring your future will help you design you future. Designing your future will help you to start coding your future.</p>
<p><strong>Know thyself</strong> was one of three maxims, or codes of conduct, proposed for coding your future and inscribed on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Apollo_(Delphi)">Temple of Apollo in Delphi</a>, in ancient Greece, shown in figure <a href="exploring#fig:delphi-fig">2.13</a>. It’s still an important code thousands of years later. To explore your future, you must first know thyself. If you don’t know who you are know, it will be harder to expore who you might become in the future.</p>

<p>This chapter has looked at exploring yourself and who you are. Being self aware, understanding your strengths and weaknesses is key to getting what you need from your future. Questions about your identity are non-trivial, hopefully this chapter has improved your self-awareness and helped you answer some of the questions about what motivates you and what you want out of life. You will need to keep exploring your future because some aspects of your identity are bound to change over time.</p>

<p>What do you know and what don’t you know about yourself, see figure <a href="exploring#fig:mathers-known-fig">2.14</a>? These fundamental design questions you’ll need to address when you starting building your future. This chapter has looked at some simple techniques for exploring your unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve improved your self-awareness, in the next part we’ll investigate techniques for looking after your self in chapter <a href="nurturing#nurturing">3</a>: <em>Nurturing your Future</em>.</p>

## Exercise: Sail Boat
# SITUATION:

* You are on an island with four other people
* You can see the mainland in the distance
* It is too far to swim there
* There is a sailing boat on the island
* You don’t know how to sail
* You only have enough supplies to survive one day
* Next to the sailing boat are some resources

### Your options

Prioritise the following options by writing a number `1` next to your first choice and number `2` next to your second choice, and so on.

* Discuss only the realistic options available
* Tell everyone how motivated you are to find an answer
* Read the ‘Manual of Sailing Techniques’
* Test that the sailboat is ready and prepared to sail
* Work out the different ways that the sail boat could be used
* Make a full analysis of the situation, the island, and all the available resources
* Discuss the importance of getting off the island
* Ask individuals to show everyone whatever they know about sailing
