Hello and welcome to \emph{Coding Your Future} at \href{https://www.cdyf.me}{\texttt{www.cdyf.me}}. This guidebook will help you to design, build, test and \texttt{code} your future in computing. Also available as a free ebook and pdf (see section \ref{downloading}), this guide is aimed at ALL students in higher education. While the guide supports undergraduate teaching at the University of Manchester, it doesn't actually matter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{where} in the world you are studying
\item
  what \emph{stage} of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year
\item
  what \emph{level} you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate
\item
  what \emph{institution} you are studying at, this book is University and institution agnostic
\item
  what \emph{subject} you are studying, as long as you are \textbf{computationally curious}
\end{itemize}

There is something in this guidebook for \emph{any} student of computing, both those inside and outside of Computer Science departments. 👨🏿‍💻👨‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩‍💻👩🏿‍💻

\hypertarget{picturethis}{%
\section{Imagining your future}\label{picturethis}}

This is a self-help guide but a lot of self-help literature can be dry, dull, textbooky, generic and boring with few illustrations and conversations. In the novel \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice\%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland}{Alice's Adventures in Wonderland}} \citep{wonderland} shown in figure \ref{fig:aiw-fig}, the protagonist Alice wonders why her sister is reading a book without pictures.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/alicequotation} \caption{Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ``and what is the use of a book,'' thought Alice ``without pictures or conversations? \citep{wonderland} Public domain image of the cover of the 1898 edition of the novel \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice\%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland}{Alice's Adventures in Wonderland}} via Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/3S4C}{w.wiki/3S4C} adapted using the \href{https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238}{Wikipedia app}}\label{fig:aiw-fig}
\end{figure}



Pictures tell stories, pictures explain. Pictures help you understand. Pictures help you imagine. So this book uses pictures (and conversations) to help you visualise your future. Other key differences between this and other guidebooks are outlined in section \ref{thinkdifferent}.

\hypertarget{vaccine}{%
\section{Your future aims}\label{vaccine}}

This guidebook aims to help you develop stronger habits of mind, body and soul using five key ingredients: \textbf{\texttt{C}}, \textbf{\texttt{D}}, \textbf{\texttt{Y}}, \textbf{\texttt{F}} and \textbf{\texttt{.me}}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\texttt{C\ is\ for\ CODE}}: Instructions, algorithms, recipes, methods and strategies contained in this guidebook. This \texttt{code} is for your consumption, not for a machine.
\item
  \textbf{\texttt{D\ is\ for\ DATA}}: From big data to microdata, your data to my data. Structured data, un-structured data and semi-structured data. Facts, statistics, graphs, pictures and our data. Bytes, bits and bobs collected together for your analysis and amusement
\item
  \textbf{\texttt{Y\ is\ for\ YOU}}: This book is all about you, with activities and other \emph{coding challenges} for you to do in addition to just passively reading
\item
  \textbf{\texttt{F\ is\ for\ FUTURES}}: Possible futures for you to think about. Try not to dwell on the past. Think about the future. Think about \emph{your} future. \citep{thinkaboutthefuture, wroteforluck}
\item
  \textbf{\texttt{.me\ is\ for\ ME}}: Hello, my name is Duncan, see figure \ref{fig:hello-my-name-fig}. I'm your tour guide here. If you're feeling a bit lost, follow me and together we can starting coding your future.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.89\linewidth]{images/Hello-my-name-is-Duncan} 

}

\caption{Hello, my name is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_(given_name)}{Duncan}. If you're feeling a bit lost, follow me and together we can starting coding your future. Please don't call me \texttt{Sir}, \texttt{Professor} or \texttt{Doctor}, just call me \textbf{Duncan}. Titles are tinsel! \citep{shelley} Image adapted from \emph{Hello my name is \ldots{} sticker} by Eviatar Bach, public domain \href{https://w.wiki/32RV}{w.wiki/32RV}}\label{fig:hello-my-name-fig}
\end{figure}



\emph{Coding your future} explores techniques for investigating career possibilities, job searching, making career decisions, submitting applications and competing successfully in interviews and the workplace.

Alongside these practical engineering issues, this guidebook also encourages you to \emph{design your future} by taking a step back and reflecting on the bigger picture. You will apply \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking}{computational thinking} techniques, to reflect on who you are, what your story is, how you communicate with other people and what your experience is. As there is a computational theme, you will also need to reflect on what your \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output}{inputs and outputs (I/O)} are, both now and in the future. You'll also need to think about what recipes (or algorithms) you might start experimenting with

This guidebook investigates professional and pastoral issues in computing, for those with and without Computer Science degrees in the early stage of their careers.

\hypertarget{nilo}{%
\section{What you won't learn}\label{nilo}}

This guidebook will NOT teach you how to write code, there's already lots of fantastic resources to help you do that. We discuss some of them in chapter \ref{computing} on \emph{computing your future}.

\hypertarget{bilo}{%
\section{Learning your future}\label{bilo}}

So what \emph{will} you learn from this guidebook? After reading this guidebook, watching the videos and doing the exercises you will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Improve your self-awareness by describing who you are, what motivates you and your strengths and weaknesses
\item
  Decide on and adjust your job search strategies
\item
  Identify employers, sectors and roles that are of interest to you\\
\item
  Improve your written communication skills both for job applications and communicating with other people
\item
  Plan and prepare competitive written applications using standard techniques including CVs, covering letters, application forms and digital profiles
\item
  Compete confidently and successfully in interviews. Anticipate and prepare for technical and non-technical questions
\item
  Plan further possibilities in your career such as promotion, postgraduate study \& research, alternative employment and longer term goals
\item
  Search and navigate a large ``wordbase'' (this guidebook and the work it cites). A wordbase is like a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebase}{\texttt{codebase}}, only written predominantly in natural language.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{prereq}{%
\subsection{Your future requirements}\label{prereq}}

As the title of this guidebook implies, there is a computational flavour here, but you do not have to be studying Computer Science to benefit. There are two main target audiences for this guidebook:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying Computer Science as a major or minor part of their degree. This includes software engineering, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction (HCI), information systems, health informatics, data science, gaming, cybersecurity and all the other myriad flavours of Computer Science
\item
  Undergraduate and postgraduate students studying \emph{any} subject, with little or no Computer Science at all. You are curious to know about what role computing could play in your future career because computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists, see chapter \ref{computing} on \emph{Computing your Future}
\end{enumerate}

So the prerequisites for this book are that you are studying (or have studied) at University where English is one of the main spoken languages. You \emph{may} have some experience already, either casual, voluntary or otherwise, but this book does \textbf{not} assume that you have already been employed in some capacity.

\hypertarget{gut}{%
\subsection{Gutting your future}\label{gut}}

Reading this book from cover to cover like a novel is not recommended. That would be foolish.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/fish-gutting} 

}

\caption{Don't \emph{read} this book, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disembowelment}{disembowel it}! Eviscerate it! Gut it like a fish! Enjoy the nourishing flesh and discard the less appetising organs of its gastrointestinal tract. You'll need to decide which is which, depending on your tastes and appetite. CC0 Public domain image of fish gutting by Wilfredor via Wikimedia commons \href{https://w.wiki/_23m}{w.wiki/\_23m} adapted using the \href{https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238}{Wikipedia app}}\label{fig:gut-fig}
\end{figure}



Instead of reading this book, I suggest you follow the advice given to historian \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodruff}{William Woodruff} about reading books when he was at University:

\begin{quote}
``You don't READ books, you GUT them!''
\hfill --- William Woodruff \citep{nabend}
\end{quote}

So, gut this book like the fish in figure \ref{fig:gut-fig}. Identify the chapters that are most useful to you (the flesh), and skip the rest (the guts). Which chapters are flesh and which are guts will depend on what stage of the journey you are at. This guidebook is designed to be as ``guttable'' as possible. To aid gutting, the version published at \href{https://www.cdyf.me/}{cdyf.me} has a built in search and tables of contents. Before you can gut the fish, you'll need an anatomical map shown in figure \ref{fig:map-fig}.

\hypertarget{mapping}{%
\section{Mapping your future}\label{mapping}}

This guidebook is split into four parts, shown in the map in figure \ref{fig:map-fig}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In chapters \ref{rebooting} to \ref{computing} we look at \emph{designing} your future
\item
  In chapters \ref{debugging} to \ref{researching} we look at \emph{building} and \emph{testing} your future
\item
  In chapters \ref{ruling} to \ref{scheduling} we look at \emph{deploying} your future
\item
  In chapters \ref{raluca} to \ref{reading} we hear from students who are \emph{coding} their future
\end{enumerate}

Let's look in a bit more detail at the content of each of the four parts of this guidebook:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Course Map V3} 

}

\caption{Mapping your future: Each yellow dot on this diagram is a chapter in \emph{Coding Your Future}. The chapters on the left tackle design issues like \emph{who are you}? Chapters on the right tackle the practicalities of executing and testing your career choices, such as \emph{debugging your CV}.

\end{figure}



\hypertarget{parti}{%
\subsection{Designing your future}\label{parti}}

The first six chapters of this guidebook look at what engineers call \emph{design}. When you build anything, a bridge, a piece of software, a car or a plane you'll need to do some design like the blueprint in figure \ref{fig:brooklyn-fig}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/brooklyn-bridge-blueprint} 

}

\caption{Designing your future is about drawing up a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint}{blueprint}, like this one for the elevation of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge}{Brooklyn Bridge} in New York. What does your blueprint look like? Chapter's \ref{rebooting} through to \ref{computing} will help you design your future.}\label{fig:brooklyn-fig}
\end{figure}



Building a career isn't that different to building anything else, you'll need to do some design work and it will probably be iterative. Designing things often involves answering tricky questions. So when you're designing your future you'll need to cover the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Chapter \ref{rebooting}: \emph{Rebooting your future} discusses why you should bother reading this guidebook
\item
  Chapter \ref{knowing}: \emph{Knowing your future} challenges you to reflect on who you are, what makes you unique and what you have to offer
\item
  Chapter \ref{nurturing}: \emph{Nurturing your future} encourages you to pay attention to your mental and physical health
\item
  Chapter \ref{writing}: \emph{Writing your future} explores your soft communication skills, how they complement your hard skills and why employers value them so much
\item
  Chapter \ref{computing}: \emph{Computing your future} looks at the role computing can play in your career, especially if Computer Science is not a major part of your degree
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{partii}{%
\subsection{Building and testing your future}\label{partii}}

The next seven chapters look at building (and testing) your future, what engineers like to call \emph{implementation} or \emph{execution} shown in figure \ref{fig:manhattan-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/manhattan_bridge} 

}

\caption{Just like the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Bridge}{Manhattan Bridge}, your future will be easier to build once you've done some preliminary design. You don't need a grand design with tonnes of details, a simple sketch will do. Design questions are covered in the first part of this guidebook on designing your future. Picture of the Manhattan bridge under construction in 1909 adapted from a public domain image via Wikimedia commons \href{https://w.wiki/32Rg}{w.wiki/32Rg}}\label{fig:manhattan-fig}
\end{figure}



Once you've started to answer the design questions in the first part, you can start to implement (or build) your career and think about what the next steps will be.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Chapter \ref{debugging}: \emph{Debugging your future} looks at debugging your written communication such as covering letters, application forms and digital portfolios.
\item
  Chapter \ref{experiencing}: \emph{Experiencing your future} asks you to reflect on your experience and help identify where you can improve it
\item
  Chapter \ref{finding}: \emph{Finding your future} looks at where and how can you look for interesting opportunities
\item
  Chapter \ref{broadening}: \emph{Broadening your future} encourages you to broaden your horizons. What are the possibilities beyond the obvious?
\item
  Chapter \ref{speaking}: \emph{Speaking your future} looks how can you turn interviews to your advantage and negotiate any offers you receive
\item
  Chapter \ref{surviving}: \emph{Surviving your future} looks at the next steps. Once you've landed a job, how will you survive and thrive outside (and after) University
\item
  Chapter \ref{achieving}: \emph{Achieving your future} looks at evidence you can collect of your learning and development using various kinds of certifiable evidence
\item
  Chapter \ref{researching}: \emph{Researching your future} discusses if a Masters degree or a PhD right for you?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{partiii}{%
\subsection{Deploying your future}\label{partiii}}

The third part of this book, looks at deployment issues that follow from the design, build and test phases above. You'll need good deployment strategies to help with the inevitable stresses and strains of building your future as shown in \ref{fig:clifton-fig}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/clifton} 

}

\caption{Huge supporting chains on the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton_Suspension_Bridge}{Clifton Suspension Bridge} in Bristol allow heavy loads pass over the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Avon,_Bristol}{river Avon}. You'll need good support to cope with the stresses and strains of building, testing and deploying your future. Clifton suspension bridge picture adapted from original by Nic Trott via Wikimedia commons \href{https://w.wiki/32tu}{w.wiki/32tu}}\label{fig:clifton-fig}
\end{figure}



\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Chapter \ref{ruling}: \emph{Ruling your future} provides \emph{Ten Simple Rules for Coding your Future}, this book in a nutshell
\item
  Chapter \ref{hacking}: \emph{Hacking your future} invites you to put yourself in the employers shoes by hacking other people's CVs
\item
  Chapter \ref{moving}: \emph{Moving your future} looks at opportunities outside of capital cities like London
\item
  Chapter \ref{enjoying}: \emph{Enjoying your future} provides a soundtrack that might help with your wellbeing
\item
  Chapter \ref{actioning}: \emph{Actioning your future} gets you to think about your actions by emphasising verbs on your job applications
\item
  Chapter \ref{scheduling}: \emph{Scheduling your future} is the live synchronous sessions for this course, if you're not participating in these, schedule a time every day or week for personal development
\end{itemize}

The final part, \emph{Coding your Future}, from chapter \ref{hearing} gives an overview of the podcast which accompanies this book: \emph{Hearing your Future}. Each subsequent chapter meets a student who is \emph{Coding their Future} and asks, how did they get to where they are and where are they going next? The final chapter \ref{reading}: \emph{Reading your future} lists everything cited in this guidebook.

\hypertarget{themes}{%
\section{Your future themes}\label{themes}}

This guidebook aims to help you build a bridge from where you are now to where you'd like to be in the future. Each chapter of the book contains the following recurring themes:

\begin{figure}

I'm looking for feedback and contributions on everything in this guidebook from the small things like typos, grammatical errors and spelling mistakes through to bigger issues for each chapter such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Does the chapter make sense, is it clear?
\item
  Does it strike the right tone, is it pitched at the right level? Not patronising? Too many platitudes?
\item
  Are there too many motivational (or \href{https://despair.com/collections/demotivators}{demotivational}) quotations?
\item
  Where is it too long and waffly (see figure \ref{fig:shorterletter-fig}) or too short?
\item
  Are there too many (or too few) pictures? What needs more illustration?
\item
  Is it well scoped? Too broad or too narrow?
\item
  Are the stated learning objectives met by the chapter?
\item
  Are the activities clear? Can students understand why the activities are recommended? What other activities could be added?
\item
  Will it make sense to global readers e.g.~will students from America, China and India etc understand the quirks and idioms of English language and culture
\item
  Are there too many metaphors? Mixed metaphors? Awkward analogies? Idiotic idioms? Annoying alliterations?
\item
  Too many citations? Not enough citations? Missed any key citations?
\item
  What's missing?
\item
  Where are the unstated assumptions? Where is the unconscious bias?
\item
  What are the issues with equality, diversity and inclusion?
\item
  Are there too many musical references or annoying emoji? Please bear in mind I'm trying to strike an irreverent, light-hearted and playful tone to improve readability 😜
\item
  What else should be ruthlessly edited out?
\end{itemize}

All suggestions welcome! Don't be shy. There are several ways you can contribute, depending on how comfortable you are with Git:

\hypertarget{techies}{%
\subsection{For git contributors}\label{techies}}

If you're familiar with \texttt{git} and \texttt{markdown}, there are several options if you have a github account (see \href{https://github.com/join}{github.com/join}) including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Join the discussion at \href{https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/discussions}{github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/discussions}
\item
  Raise new issues at \href{https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/new}{github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/new}
\item
  Click on the \texttt{Edit\ this\ page} link, which appears on the bottom right hand side of every page published at \href{https://www.cdyf.me}{cdyf.me} when viewed with a reasonably large screen (not a phone)
\item
  Contribute at \href{https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/contribute}{github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/contribute} and help with existing issues at \href{https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues}{github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues}
\item
  Fork the repository, make changes and submit a pull request \href{https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/pulls}{github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/pulls}. If you need to brush-up on your pulling skills see \href{http://makeapullrequest.com/}{makeapullrequest.com}
\item
  From the command line, clone the repository and submit pull requests from your own setup:
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{git clone https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf.git}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Most of the guidebook is generated from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown}{RMarkdown}, that's \href{https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/search?l=RMarkdown}{all the \texttt{*.Rmd} files}. So markdown files are the only ones you should edit because everything else is generated from them including the \texttt{*.html}, \texttt{*.tex}, \texttt{*.pdf},\texttt{*.epub} and \texttt{*.docx} files.

\hypertarget{elseif}{%
\subsection{For everyone else}\label{elseif}}

If you don't want to (or can't) use \texttt{git} and \href{https://github.com/}{github.com} then you can:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Add comments by annotating \href{https://www.cdyf.me/cdyf.pdf}{cdyf.pdf} or \href{https://cdyf.me/cdyf.epub}{cdyf.epub} using your personal tablet of choice (iPad, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReMarkable}{reMarkable} or whatever) and \href{https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact}{emailing your updated version to me}
\item
  Suggest changes by editing the Microsoft Word version at \href{http://cdyf.me/cdyf.docx}{cdyf.docx}. The text is all there, but the images are all over the place. This is because the typesetting algorithms in Word aren't anything like as good as the \href{https://latex4year1.netlify.app/}{LaTeX ones} used to create the \href{https://www.cdyf.me/cdyf.pdf}{cdyf.pdf} (output) from the \href{https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/blob/master/_book/cdyf.tex}{cdyf.tex} (input).\footnote{Don't say I didn't warn you!} Make sure you've \href{https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/track-changes-in-word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a}{turned on track changes in Word}, one of it's \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_feature}{killer features} that allows your corrections to be easily identified from the original text.
\item
  Just \href{https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact}{email me suggestions for improvements}
\end{itemize}

Any corrections or suggestions will be gratefully received and noted in the acknowledgements section \ref{thanks}, unless you tell me otherwise. I welcome all improvements, big and small.

\hypertarget{thanks}{%
\section{Acknowledgements}\label{thanks}}

The content of this book is based on hundreds of conversations I have had with students of (mostly) Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics and Engineering, since 2012. It is also based on conversations I've had with their employers too.

\textbf{\texttt{\#\ Coding\ Comment}}

This acknowledgements section is really looooooong because I try to practice what I preach about the importance of expressing gratitude, see section \ref{lays}. It also serves as a live demonstration of a (public) \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal}{gratitude journal}. Expressing gratitude, publicly and privately, is a simple and proven technique for improving your mental health. It will also improve the mental health of the people who you thank, and strengthen the communities that you are part of, see \ref{signposts3}.

If you want to get to the main content of this book you can skip this and go straight to chapter \ref{rebooting}.

\hypertarget{students}{%
\subsection{Thank you students}\label{students}}

First and foremost, I would like to thank all the students who have helped with this book, both directly and indirectly see figure \ref{fig:giants-fig}.

So, if you have studied some flavour of Computer Science at the University of Manchester since 2012, there's a high probability you have contributed to this book. Thank you for having the courage to tell me your stories. Thank you for being ambitious, hard working, talented, fearless, creative, inspirational and listening to me (sometimes). It has been my pleasure and privilege to work with you all.

I'd especially like to thank current and former industrial experience (IE) students who have completed a year in industry as part of their degree as well as those who have done summer internships, either as part of the Master of Engineering (MEng) program or otherwise, particularly (in alphabetical order) Matt Akerman, \href{https://github.com/samialabed}{Sami Alabed}, Teodora Balmos, Luke Beamish, Eirik Björnerstedt, Liam Breeze, Jingxuan Chen, \href{https://www.cdyf.me/raluca}{Raluca Cruceru}, \href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDmn8CxaXGxZSKq83vhzULw}{Petia Davidova}, Maximilian Gama, Mihail Ghinea, David Green, \href{https://github.com/eldog}{Lloyd Henning}, Cristian Ilin, \href{https://github.com/calini}{Călin Ilie}, \href{https://www.cdyf.me/sneha}{Sneha Kandane}, Joshua Langley, Struan McDonough, Milen Orfeev, \href{https://www.cdyf.me/jason}{Jason Ozuzu}, \href{https://www.cdyf.me/alice}{Alice Păcuraru}, \href{https://www.cdyf.me/carmen}{Carmen Práxedes}, Kristina Radinova, Tom Robinson, \href{https://github.com/teostoleru}{Teodora Stoleru}, \href{https://github.com/dj-foxxy}{Peter Sutton}, Kamil Synak, Boris Vasilev and \href{https://www.cdyf.me/brian}{Brian Yim Tam}. In addition, the \href{http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk}{PASS leaders} and facilitators, (\href{https://sites.google.com/view/compscipass2-2021}{PASS2-2021}, \href{https://sites.google.com/view/compsci-pass}{PASS2-2020}, PASS2-2019 etc), \href{https://unicsmcr.com/}{UniCSmcr.com}, \href{https://github.com/unicsmcr/hacksoc.com}{HackSoc}, \href{https://github.com/cssoc}{CSSoc} and \href{https://github.com/Man-UP}{Manchester Ultimate Programming} members have all been influential on the content of this book. I've learned heaps by manually trawling through thousands of your CVs too, so if you've shown me a copy of your CV, thanks! Chapter \ref{debugging} on \emph{Debugging your future} (self assessment) and chapter \ref{hacking} on \emph{Hacking your future} (peer assessment) are based on the most common bugs (or are they features?) I've seen in CVs.

So, thank you students for being studious. 🙏

\hypertarget{employers}{%
\subsection{Thank you employers}\label{employers}}

Thanks to all the organisations who have employed students from the Department of Computer Science as either summer interns, year long placements or graduates. A big chunk of this guidebook documents their experience of employers and their graduate recruitment programs.

Thanks to Niall Beard and \href{https://github.com/sharifsalah}{Sharif Salah} at Google for introducing me to Google's Technical Writing course in section \ref{techwriting}. Writing is rewriting!

So, thanks employers for employing our students. 🙏

\hypertarget{colleagues}{%
\subsection{Thank you colleagues}\label{colleagues}}

I've also had significant support from colleagues in the Department of Computer Science (\href{https://twitter.com/csmcr}{@csmcr}), and many other parts of the University: (engineering, natural sciences, social sciences, biology, medicine and health etc) and support staff at the University of Manchester. (\href{https://twitter.com/UoMCareers}{@UoMCareers}, \href{https://twitter.com/alumniUoM}{@alumniUoM}, \href{https://twitter.com/OfficialUoM}{@OfficialUoM})

Thank you \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Goble}{Carole Goble} for building the community that supported me through postgraduate study. Thanks for creating the environment which this book was written in, especially the \href{https://esciencelab.org.uk/}{e-Science lab}, Information Management Group (IMG), Software Sustainability Institute (\href{https://software.ac.uk/}{software.ac.uk}) and their spin-offs. Thanks for patiently re-teaching me how to write better by covering early drafts of my Masters thesis in red ink and less patiently (on subsequent revisions) swear words. 🤬

Thank you \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber}{Steve Furber} for playing guitar in our ``boy band'' \href{https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/research\#tuningcomplete}{Tuning Complete}. All we've got is your bass guitar, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Chords_and_the_Truth}{three chords and the truth}. \citep{harlan, allalongthewatchtower} 🎸

Thank you \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_John_Miles}{Jim Miles} for encouraging me to write a book shortly after you offered me a job. I thought you were joking (about the book) but it actually turned out to be another one of your great ideas. Thanks Jim. 🙏

I'd also like to thank the only three people in the whole world who've had the \sout{misfortune} pleasure of reading all of my PhD thesis cover to cover; \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_David_Stevens}{Robert Stevens}, \href{https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/anilwipat.html}{Anil Wipat} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Pettifer}{Steve Pettifer}. I suspect it was as painful for you to read as it was for me to write it. Thanks Robert for your relentless patience and giving me a well timed, well aimed kick up the (proverbial) arse to write this book in the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Hotel,_Manchester}{Midland Hotel, Manchester} at the May ball.

So, thank you colleagues for being collegiate. You make the University of Manchester an enjoyable place to work.

\subsubsection{Thanks to academic staff}\label{academia}}

Thanks to past and present academic colleagues (see figure \ref{fig:academics-fig}), PhD students and academic staff at the University of Manchester (and elsewhere) who have contributed to this guidebook and the environment it was written in.

Thanks to St Laurence comprehensive school (\href{https://st-laurence.com/}{st-laurence.com}), a community I am proud, lucky, privileged and grateful to have grown up in and still be part of decades later: Adam, Alan, Andrea, Andrew, Anna, Bouncing Barney, Charlotte, Catherine, Clare, Dan, Doug, Debbie, James, Jenny, Jim, Jo, John, Jon, Lou, Marcus, Marjorie, Matthew, Philip, Portia, Richard, Sasha, Scott, Simon, Sophie, Sophia, Stephen, Steve \& Wilf. I'm especially grateful for the friendship of former St Laurence school students I've enjoyed music, cycling, football, walking, travelling, holidaying, drinking and camaraderie with, see figure \ref{fig:bradlads-fig}.

I used to foolishly think it was secondary schools that did all the serious teaching, but they'd be \emph{nowhere} without the crucial foundations laid in primary school. It takes a whole community (a village) to raise a child and a lot of that starts in primary school, see figure \ref{fig:clinton-fig}.

\section{About me}\label{duncan}}

Hello, my name is \href{https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/}{Duncan Hull} and I'm currently writing\footnote{As you can probably tell, it isn't finished yet} this guidebook for undergraduate and postgraduate students as part of my day job at the University of Manchester where I'm a lecturer (≈ \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_professor}{Assistant Professor}) in the \href{https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/}{Department of Computer Science}.

So what's \emph{my} story? I've been gainfully employed as a paperboy, supermarket cashier, shelf stacker, sausage packer, computer hacker, pork pie filler, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plongeur}{plongeur}, chef, dogsbody, field assistant, database administrator, deli counter server, consultant, matchday steward, envelope stuffer, high school teacher, postdoc, research scientist, chairperson, software engineer, lecturer, external examiner, tutor and scholar. Like many people, my path has been a bit of an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey}{Odyssey} or what \href{https://twitter.com/HelenTupper}{Helen Tupper} and Sarah Ellis call a ``\href{https://www.amazingif.com/books/}{squiggly career}''. \citep{squigglybook} It's highly likely that, like me, your career will not follow a neat linear trajectory either. \citep{squigglytalk}

Beyond the paid stuff, I've done a range of voluntary work too, serving as a competition judge, fundraiser, \href{https://codeclub.org}{code club} \& \href{https://coderdojo.com}{coderdojo} leader, rabble rouser, \href{https://www.manchesterdigital.com/}{digital council} member, \href{https://governorsforschools.org.uk/}{school governor}, curator, librarian, beer drinker, \href{https://wiki-loves-scientists.org.uk/}{wikipedia trainer}, \href{https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/}{journal clubber} and editor. But as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Lane}{Ronnie Lane} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Wood}{Ronnie Wood} (figure \ref{fig:faces-fig}) once said, I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/faces} 

}

\caption{Hindsight is a great teacher. Poor old grandad I laughed at all his words but I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger, see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooh_La_La_(Faces_song)}{Ooh La La} \citep{faces} I've written some of what I know now in this guidebook, I hope you find it useful.}\label{fig:faces-fig}
\end{figure}



This guidebook documents some of what I know now, that I wish I'd known, when I was younger. If you're starting your career, I hope you find these insights and exercises useful. I've sat on both sides of many interview tables, as interviewer and interviewee. I have had some spectacular failures, alongside some modest successes, and have included personal stories where they are relevant.

Most of what I have learned about employment comes from listening to, watching and helping students as they interact with employers on the first tentative steps in their careers, particularly through our industrial experience program, see figure \ref{fig:ie-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/ie-fig-1}

\caption{Number of undergraduate Computer Science students completing a year in industry as part of their degree at the University of Manchester. Since 2008 over 900 students have completed the program that I have been leading since 2012. We've managed to double the number of students doing placements per year. As you can see in the histogram, the COVID-19 pandemic started having an effect on students starting placements in 2020.}\label{fig:ie-fig}
\end{figure}



I've documented some of what our students have taught me, so reading this book may help you learn from some of their successes and failures.

\hypertarget{part-designing}{%
\part{DESIGNING}\label{part-designing}}

\hypertarget{rebooting}{%
\chapter{Rebooting your future}\label{rebooting}}

The first part of this book is about \emph{designing} your future. Before we get started, we need to reboot and tackle a fundamental design issue. Why the hell would you want to bother reading this guidebook when you have so many other things to do right now?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ✅ You are a busy person, YES!
\item
  ✅ Your time is a precious and finite resource, YES!
\item
  ✅ You could be spending that precious time right now in lots of other ways, YES!
\item
  ✅ There are mountains of self-help guides and courses already, YES!
\item
  ✅ Do you really need \emph{yet another} guidebook? YES! YES! YES!
\end{itemize}

You should read this guidebook because it is different to all the other guidebooks! It will help you design, test, build, debug and \texttt{code} your future in computing.

Before you start coding, we need to reboot. Come with me down the rabbit hole in figure \ref{fig:rabbit-fig} and let me explain\ldots{} 🐇

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/Rabbit-hole}

\end{figure}



\hypertarget{ilo1}{%
\section{What you will learn}\label{ilo1}}

After reading this chapter you will be able to reboot your future by :

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Setting your expectations for using this guidebook, and open some doors to your future
\item
  Travelling down the rabbit hole into the underworld of employment
\item
  Discussing some of the gaps that exist between formal education and employment and how you can bridge them
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{wonderland}{%
\section{Let's go down the rabbit hole}\label{wonderland}}

In the novel \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice\%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland}{Alice's Adventures in Wonderland}} \citep{wonderland}, the protagonist Alice follows a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rabbit}{white rabbit} down a hole. What she discovers is a strange underground world populated by weird and wonderful characters. The world of work can sometimes be a mysterious underworld where you adventure in wonderland accompanied by colourful characters.

You will spend lots of time in this wonderland, potentially as much as 80,000 hours of your life. \citep{iip1, iip2} So join me down the rabbit hole, it's fun (honest), and sooner or later you'll have to come down here anyway. So open up the door to the new possibilities in your future.

\hypertarget{opening}{%
\section{Opening your future}\label{opening}}

Studying at University opens new doors to your future, some of which will take you down rabbit holes. As the poet \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemn_Sissay}{Lemn Sissay} puts it (figure \ref{fig:lemn-fig}):

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/lemninspire} 

}

\caption{Open all doors, open all senses, open all defences, ask: What were these closed for? From \emph{Inspire and be Inspired} by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemn_Sissay}{Lemn Sissay} whose poetry is even better when you hear it, rather than just read it \href{https://youtu.be/WzZs1w3NWzg}{youtu.be/WzZs1w3NWzg}. \citep{sissay} Portrait of Sissay speaking in 2010 by Philosophy Football via Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/3VYT}{w.wiki/3VYT} adapted using the \href{https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238}{Wikipedia app}}\label{fig:lemn-fig}
\end{figure}



So University is a fantastic opportunity for you to open lots of new doors in your life and see where they take you.

\hypertarget{roi}{%
\section{Maximising your future}\label{roi}}

As well as opening your future, studying at University is about \emph{investing} in your future. You're spending lots of your time and money at University. Hopefully, you've picked a subject that stimulates and challenges you intellectually while allowing you to find and develop your unique talents. But there's another reason that you probably chose to study at University and that was to improve your job prospects. This guidebook will:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Help you maximise the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment}{return on investment} (ROI) of the substantial amount of your time and money you have already put into your education, from high school through to University
\item
  Give you an overview of important professional issues that are sometimes neglected or sidelined in school and University curricula
\item
  Highlight and review essential resources beyond this guidebook that will help with the above
\end{enumerate}

All of the resources that can help you are scattered around in lots of different places. There are books, there are videos, there are podcasts, there are websites and jobs boards. There are online courses, blogs, social media, newspaper columns, journal articles, marketing material and many other good resources. It is overwhelming.

\hypertarget{responsibility}{%
\section{Your future is your responsibility}\label{responsibility}}

When Andy Stanford-Clark started working at IBM as a graduate fresh out of University, his manager gave him the career advice shown in figure \ref{fig:andysc-fig}:

\begin{figure}

Andy is now Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of IBM in the UK and an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Master_Inventor}{IBM Master inventor}, so it was probably good advice. There are plenty people who can help design and build your future, ultimately it is \textbf{YOU} who has to take responsibility for the implementation (if you like, the \texttt{code}). The sooner you get coding the better.

At University, there are lots of people can help design and build your future: peers, friends, academic staff, your careers service, employers and your wider social and professional networks but ultimately it is \emph{your} responsibility to sort out whatever comes next. That might sound obvious but don't wait to get started later or for somebody else to do it for you, because it probably won't happen.

\hypertarget{entitled}{%
\section{Your degree is not enough}\label{entitled}}

You have worked hard to get the grades you needed to get into University. You've spent (or are spending) a significant amount of time and money studying your chosen discipline. You are really \emph{geeking out} by going deep into your subject for a substantial period of time. Geekery, by which I mean \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek}{being interested in a subject for its own sake}, is a \emph{good} thing. Earning the title \emph{geek} is a compliment, not an insult, and you should wear your geek badge with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Pride_Day}{geek pride}! Some people even say:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The geeks will inherit the earth, see figure \ref{fig:geekout-fig}
\item
  The (geeky) weirdness flows between us, anyone can tell to see us \citep{freakscene}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{YOU} are a geek, so where is \emph{your} inheritance?

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/blessed-are-the-geeks} 

}

\caption{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_5:5}{Blessed are the \sout{meek} geeks, for they shall inherit the earth}. \citep{inherit, blessed} You are a geek, so where is your inheritance? Image of stained glass window by Norbert Schnitzler via Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/43LN}{w.wiki/43LN} adapted using the \href{https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238}{Wikipedia app}}\label{fig:geekout-fig}
\end{figure}



As a studious geek you might be tempted to believe that the world owes you something in return for all your geekiness. Unfortunately that's not the case.

At some point during or after your study, you might find yourself applying for a graduate job or graduate scheme. EVERYONE applying for these opportunities will have a degree or be rapidly on their way to getting one. So having a degree, even a really geeky one, isn't going to set you apart much from your competition. Even having a first class degree may not distinguish you that much your competitors \citep{gradeinflation, firstclass}. Some employers would rather not know (or don't care) what University you went to, so your education might not make you stand out as much as you might like anyway. \citep{bigfour, eyfirm}

What \textbf{WILL} distinguish you from your competitors is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  your \texttt{experience}: see chapter \ref{experiencing}
\item
  your \texttt{projects}: see section \ref{mycvpj}
\item
  your communication skills:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Writing: see chapter \ref{writing}
  \item
    Speaking: see chapter \ref{speaking}
  \item
    Listening: see chapter \ref{hearing}
  \item
    Reading: see chapter \ref{reading}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  your actions: what have you \textbf{done} with all of the above? How have you applied these fundamental communication skills to perform higher level communication tasks such as understanding, negotiating, persuading and leading etc. See examples of actions in chapter \ref{actioning}
\item
  your \texttt{results} and \texttt{evidence}: see \texttt{C.A.R.E} in section \ref{care}: context, action, results and evidence. We're talking about all your results, not just exam results.
\item
  any \texttt{leadership} you can demonstrate or \texttt{awards} that you have picked up along the way, see section \ref{prizes}
\end{itemize}

If you think that your degree will be enough to get you the job you want, bear in mind that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There are more and more graduates, the UK for example recently passed the milestone of 50\% of young people going into higher education. This compares to just 15\% of over 18s who stayed in higher education in 1980 \citep{lotsofgrads}
\item
  While a degree is a \emph{necessary} condition for joining a graduate scheme or taking a graduate job it is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_and_sufficiency}{not a \emph{sufficient} condition}. Having a degree will not set you apart much from your competition, every applicant will have a Bachelors degree.
\item
  There are lots of graduates in your discipline. In the UK, for example, around 9,000 students graduate every year in Computer Science. If you're studying in the UK, what makes you different from the other 8,999 computer scientists graduating in your year?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/lotsofgrads-fig-1} 

}

\caption{Percentage of young people in the UK going into higher education between 1980 and 2018. Over the last forty years, the proportion of young people going into higher education has more than doubled from 15\% in 1980 to over 50\% in 2018. Data taken from BBC news article on \href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-49841620}{the symbolic target of 50\% at university reached} \citep{lotsofgrads}}\label{fig:lotsofgrads-fig}
\end{figure}



As \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Fincher}{Sally Fincher} puts it:

\begin{quote}
Computing is one of the largest subject areas in UK higher education, and is taught in almost every institution, graduating around 9,000 students every year
\hfill --- Sally Fincher \citep{fincherreview}
\end{quote}

Now, don't be disillusioned by the statistics because any degree can open doors to many careers in computing. Studying \emph{computing} opens up plenty of doors, see figure \ref{fig:nurses-fig}. According to \href{https://twitter.com/lmicharlie}{Charlie Ball}, it is a myth that there aren't enough graduate jobs; one of four myths in the UK about the graduate labour market:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Myth 1:} \emph{Everyone goes to university nowadays} : \textasciitilde50\% isn't everyone \citep{ballmyths}
\item
  \textbf{Myth 2:} \emph{There aren't enough graduate jobs} \citep{ballmyths}
\item
  \textbf{Myth 3:} \emph{Some degrees have little value to employers}, see chapter \ref{computing}
\item
  \textbf{Myth 4:} \emph{All the best graduate jobs are in London}, (or your local big city) see chapter \ref{moving}
\end{itemize}

What the data in figure \ref{fig:lotsofgrads-fig} show is that you'll need to look \textbf{beyond} your formal education to distinguish yourself from your competition. Your degree can certainly help you start a career, and computer geekery is a commercially valuable skill but a degree (however geeky) is typically not enough by itself.

There's plenty of graduate jobs for you to apply for, but that doesn't mean its going to be easy to walk into one when you graduate. Employers are looking for more from their employees than just \emph{having} a degree, see chapter \ref{experiencing}.

\hypertarget{thisstuffmatters}{%
\section{It's too late when you graduate}\label{thisstuffmatters}}

You might be tempted to postpone making difficult career decisions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I'll do it tomorrow \ldots{}
\item
  I'll do it next week \ldots{}
\item
  I'll do it next year \ldots{}
\item
  I'll finish this assignment \ldots{}
\item
  I'll finish this exam \ldots{}
\item
  I'll finish this semester \ldots{}
\item
  I'll finish my degree first, see figure \ref{fig:procrastination-fig} \ldots{}
\end{itemize}

Procrastination is a part of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition}{human condition} and its not necessarily a bad thing. Software engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)}{Paul Graham} and journalist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Burkeman}{Oliver Burkeman} describe three types of procrastination:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html}{bad procrastination} \citep{procrastination}
\item
  \href{http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html}{good procrastination} \citep{procrastination}
\item
  better procrastination \citep{fourthousandweeks}
\end{enumerate}

We all procrastinate because there's an infinite number of tasks we could be doing but a finite amount of time in which to do them.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/procrastinator} 

}

\caption{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination}{Procrastination}: the attitude of ``I'll get my degree out of the way first then worry about jobs and careers when I finish University'' is bad procrastination. It's too late when you graduate to start thinking about what might come next \citep{procrastination} Stressed procrastinator picture by MismibaTinasheMadando on Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/3TXo}{w.wiki/3TXo}}\label{fig:procrastination-fig}
\end{figure}



Postponing decisions about your future is usually bad procrastination, because you risk neglecting the wrong things. You are relying on doing all your (career) testing at the end, when you graduate. You are procrastinating the \texttt{testing} stage of your career development, when its often better to test early and test often, so:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ❌ ``test-last (career) development'' where you get experience at the end, \emph{after} you graduate
\item
  ✅ ``test-driven (career) development'' (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development}{TDD}) where you get experience \emph{before} you graduate
\end{itemize}

It probably doesn't help that many of the issues described and discussed in this book are typically not closely integrated into the curriculum in Higher Education. You'll often find them on the edges, or completely outside of, standard University curricula.

Despite being sidelined, these issues matter and it is in your own self interests to start thinking about them right now. According to recent estimates by \emph{Investors in People}, the average person spends \textbf{80,000 hours} working during their lifetime. \citep{iip2} So, \emph{whatever} you end up doing after University, you'll be spending a lot of time doing it. Difficult decisions often get sidelined but it is never too early to \emph{experiencing your future}, see chapter \ref{experiencing}.

If you want to work for a big name like those in section \ref{bignames} or \ref{studentjobs}, many of the larger graduate employers expect you to have \emph{some} experience (see chapter \ref{experiencing}) \emph{before} you graduate. A large chunk of vacancies on graduate schemes are filled with people who have already been employed as interns or placement students within that (or another) organisation. So the sooner you start investigating employers by getting some experience the better decisions you'll be able to make about what comes next. It's (usually) too late when you graduate.

That doesn't mean you have to know EXACTLY what you want to do when you finish. Lots of students don't and I certainly didn't when I graduated. I'd done a gap year teaching in India, two summer internships (in Sweden and the United States) and a year-in-industry in the UK and I \emph{still} graduated with \textbf{no clue} as to what I wanted to do next! The important thing is that you make a start by getting some experience, paid or otherwise, see chapter \ref{experiencing}. Sometimes knowing what you \textbf{don't} want to do is just as valuable as knowing what you \emph{DO} want to do. Either way, your future starts now, see figure \ref{fig:future-now-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/the-future-is-now} 

}

\caption{Your Future starts now, not at some point later in time like when you graduate. Whatever stage of your study you are at, there's plenty you can do to start \href{https://www.cdyf.me/experiencing}{experiencing your future} today, see chapter \ref{experiencing}. Experience will make it easier to navigate your future. \emph{THE FUTURE IS NOW} by Everydayphrase \href{https://linktr.ee/everydayphrase}{linktr.ee/everydayphrase}}\label{fig:future-now-fig}
\end{figure}



Computer scientists call this problem ``search space reduction'' \citep{searchspace}. You have a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region}{feasible region} of future possibilities and you need to narrow down the candidates. You could think of coding your future as an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem}{optimisation problem}. Start optimising now, by getting some experience because it's too late when you graduate. 🎓

\hypertarget{exams}{%
\section{Yes, this WILL be on the exam}\label{exams}}

Students love to ask their teachers ``\emph{will this be on the exam}''? The short answer is \textbf{YES} (and \textbf{NO})! Yes, this will be on the exam, but NO the exam won't be set by your University. Unlike other courses you've done, the examinations for this course aren't set by your University but by employers. Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of examinations that you'll need to get good at, shown in Table \ref{tab:examtable}

So, \emph{yes}, this will be on the exam, but \emph{no}, the exams are obviously not set, administered, invigilated and marked by academics at your University. The exams are set by employers and the results are \textbf{brutally binary}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{PASS}: you've got the interview, job or promotion or\ldots{}
\item
  \textbf{FAIL}: none of the above. Next!
\end{itemize}

One of the challenging things about employers exams are, they typically do not have the bandwidth to give applicants useful feedback, other than a simple pass or fail. When it comes to job applications software engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell}{Gayle Laakmann McDowell} calls this the ``black hole''. The gravitational force of employers black holes is so strong that no CV or Résumé can escape, we'll say more about this in chapter \ref{debugging} on debugging your future.

\begin{figure}

It's a similar story with interviews, if you fluffed an interview question or came across badly, it can be really difficult to find out from the employer what you did wrong. That makes it harder to learn from your mistakes.

\hypertarget{activities}{%
\section{Practicing your future}\label{activities}}

There are practical exercises, for you to get your hands dirty with. Each chapter incorporates activities including individual exercises, group exercises, quizzes and points for wider discussion. You'll get a lot more out of this guidebook by doing the activities, rather than just reading it.

\hypertarget{relatedwork}{%
\section{Navigating your future}\label{relatedwork}}

There are \textbf{lots} of resources out there that offer self-help, career advice and techniques for self-improvement. It can be hard to know where to start, or even how to find your way around the mountains of advice.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/shelfie}

Lots of professional advice is readily available, but how will you navigate it?

To following sections give a bit more detail on the differences outlined in table \ref{tab:difftable}.

\hypertarget{signposted}{%
\subsection{Your future is signposted}\label{signposted}}

Some career resources claim (or imply) that they are the \emph{all you will need} to solve a particular problem or worse: solve \emph{all of your problems}! Just buy this book, do this course, watch this video, listen to this podcast and all your problems will go away! Rather than continue this trend, this book \textbf{signposts} some of the most useful resources, see figure \ref{fig:signposting-fig}.

\begin{figure}

Scientists call signposting \textbf{citation}, so I've signposted and cited sources in this guidebook so that you can :

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Follow them if the destinations are interesting or useful
\item
  Check and verify any facts and claims I make in this book for yourself
\end{enumerate}

While this guidebook cites lots of resources, some of them are more important than others. Each chapter summarises these in a signposts section. You'll find everything else in the references, chapter \ref{reading}. University and public libraries may also have physical and electronic copies of some of the books listed here.

I'm not suggesting that you read \emph{all} these books right now, but that if a particular chapter has piqued your interest, these signposts are good places to keep going, if you haven't already read them. I hope you'll find these signposts handy for navigating the mountains of advice. Not all who wander are lost. 🗺️🧭

\hypertarget{study}{%
\subsection{Your future is guided}\label{study}}

This guidebook to your future accompanies a course that has been co-designed by students for students, with input from academics and employers. It unites several disparate themes into one coherent story, from fundamental questions about identity and wellbeing through to more applied and practical advice on job hunting, career progression and life after University. Resources that do this are typically scattered around in many different places. There is usually no narrative to tie them all together to help students navigate the mountains of advice as they embark on the first stages of their careers. I'll guide you through the narrative, but it is a \emph{descriptive} story rather than a \emph{prescriptive} one, see figure \ref{fig:descriptive-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/prescriptive-vs-descriptive-pathways}

\caption{Many formal education courses follow a \emph{prescriptive pathway} (right), they lead you through a story from start to finish. This is the way of the University: ``\texttt{our\ courses}'' - our prospectus.

I'll guide you through the story but you'll need to choose \emph{your} way: ``\texttt{my\ way}''. You stood tall and faced it all.

I'm taking a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often}{release early, release often} \citep{Raymond1999} approach to publishing this guidebook, you could call it agile book development or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery}{continuous book delivery}, see figure \ref{fig:agile-vs-waterfall-fig} \citep{realagile}

\hypertarget{firstperson}{%
\subsection{Your future is personal}\label{firstperson}}

A lot of scientific and technical writing is written in the third person or passive voice, which is fine for academic writing, but can alienate readers. I have opted to use first person narrative where possible as it is shorter, and hopefully more engaging for you to read. \citep{googler} Where relevant, I've told personal stories to illustrate key points.

\hypertarget{openaccess}{%
\subsection{Your future has no paywall}\label{openaccess}}

You don't need to pay anything to read this book online because its not hiding behind a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall}{paywall}, see section \ref{license}. Publishing this guidebook online makes it findable and accessible, something that isn't true of knowledge locked up inside other books.

Because this guidebook is online, it is searchable, browsable and linkable. You can link to whatever level you like, top level, chapter level and to every section and subsection level. Everything important has a Uniform Resource Locator (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL}{URL}).

\hypertarget{nologin}{%
\subsection{Your future has no login}\label{nologin}}

You don't need to login to anything to use this guidebook either. Hurrah! One less password to remember.

\hypertarget{av}{%
\subsection{Your future is audible and watchable}\label{av}}

This book is not just words and pictures, but includes audio and video as well, especially:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  videos produced by third parties that are worth watching
\item
  audio produced by third parties that are worth listening to, either individual episodes or whole series
\item
  short videos produced by me, which augment the written content of this book, see the \href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLBv_u8JmyUPqmRALIjVnLg}{Coding your Future YouTube channel}
\item
  the \emph{coding your future} podcast which interviews undergraduate students, see chapter \ref{hearing}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{engage}{%
\section{Engaging with your future}\label{engage}}

I've tried to make the content of this book as engaging as possible by including pictures and conversations. \emph{Your future} is deliberately playful and light-hearted. If you think this guidebook can be improved, let me know via the mechanisms described in section \ref{contributing}. I always welcome constructive feedback, especially when it comes via a pull request. Engage, see figure \ref{fig:startrek-fig}.

\end{figure}



\hypertarget{sign1}{%
\section{Signposting your future}\label{sign1}}

Each chapter in this book has a signposts section, highlighting key reading, watching or listening you could do next. This chapter has addressed the question of \textbf{why should you bother coding your future}? The answer is that your future is your responsibility and no-one elses. There are lots of people can help shape your future, but none more than yourself. Software engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin}{Robert C. Martin} argues this point in his book \emph{The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers}. \citep{cleancoder}

What's good about \emph{The Clean Coder} is that it is short (only 200 pages), well written and to the point. The main part of the book covers professional issues in software engineering, some of which I discuss further in chapter \ref{surviving}, \emph{surviving your future}.

\hypertarget{tldr1}{%
\section{Summarising your future}\label{tldr1}}

If all that was \href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn\%27t_read}{too long, didn't read} (TL;DR) for you, then you'll be relieved to hear that each chapter has a TL;DR (executive) summary.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/tldr} 

}

\caption{There's always more stuff you should be \href{https://cdyf.me/reading}{reading}.

\end{figure}



The TL;DR for this chapter is, you should read this guidebook because it is different to all the other guidebooks. It will help you take responsibility for maximising your future. No-one else is going to do this for you. Your degree will help open up future options, but it is not enough by itself so you'll need to maximise the return on your investment. Don't procrastinate because it's too late when you graduate and \emph{YES} this will be on the exam (set by future employers). This guidebook has signposts to help you navigate, design, build, test, debug and code your future in computing.

It looks like the reboot has finished, so we're ready to go. In the next chapter, you will reflect on who you are. What's your story, coding glory?

\hypertarget{knowing}{%
\chapter{Knowing your future}\label{knowing}}

Hello, who are you? What's your story, coding glory? What are you good at, what do you like doing and what do you value? What are your hopes and dreams for the future? Tell me about your \texttt{education} and who you are. What unique talents are you finding and developing during your education? How are you striving to become a better version of you? Having good self knowledge will help you answer these big questions, which are important for your future. Knowing your future depends on knowing who you are now. 🏆

Knowing who you are now, will help you explore and understand who you might become in the future. That future you is \sout{the best possible} a \emph{better} version of you shown in \ref{fig:goal-fig}. Since you started it as a small child, your education has been:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  about bettering yourself
\item
  a key part of your identity
\item
  inherently communal and social
\end{itemize}

At University only a fraction of your education will happen during formal lectures, labs, tutorials and seminars see figure \ref{fig:stephen-fry-lecture-fig}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}



Your identity, who you are, is complex, dynamic and high-dimensional so you will need several different techniques to improve your self-awareness. Here are seven techniques to get you started:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  🔒 your protected characteristics, see section \ref{protected}
\item
  📕 your story so far, see section \ref{story}
\item
  🙂 your head, heart and hands, see section \ref{hhh}
\item
  🤔 your reason for being (ikigai), see section \ref{no42}
\item
  📊 your personality profile, see section \ref{personality}
\item
  💰 your privileges, or lack of them, see section \ref{apriv}
\item
  ☠️ your deathbed \emph{thought experiment}, see section \ref{regrets}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{protected}{%
\subsection{Your protected characteristics}\label{protected}}

Some of your identity includes characteristics that are protected. In the UK, the Equality Act of 2010\footnote{\url{http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents}} protects you from discrimination at work or in education, based on what are known as ``protected characteristics''. \citep{equality}. This means that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Your \textbf{age} should not determine how you are treated
\item
  Your \textbf{disabilities} should not determine how you are treated
\item
  Your \textbf{gender} should not determine how you are treated \citep{inferior, damore, damoreguardian, everydaysexism}
\item
  Your \textbf{gender re-assignment} should not determine how you are treated
\item
  Your \textbf{marriage} or civil partnership should not determine how you are treated
\item
  Your \textbf{pregnancy} and maternity should not determine how you are treated
\item
  Your \textbf{race} (including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin) should not determine how you are treated \citep{nottalking, superior}
\item
  Your \textbf{religion} or beliefs should not determine how you are treated
\item
  Your \textbf{sex} should not determine how you are treated \citep{harassment}
\item
  Your \textbf{sexual orientation} should not determine how you are treated \citep{nosex}
\end{itemize}

These are a special part of your identity because they are protected. This means they shouldn't be a factor in apply for a job or a subject for discussion in a job interview. Let's look at gender, sex and sexual orientation in more detail because they can be easily misunderstood. One way to understand gender better is to break it down into four characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Identity}: your gender identity
\item
  \textbf{Expression}: your gender expression
\item
  \textbf{Sex}: your biological sex
\item
  \textbf{Attraction}: your sexual and romantic orientation
\end{enumerate}

These protected characteristics are often conflated, because people tend to confuse gender, sex and sexual orientation. They are \emph{not} the same thing as shown in equation \eqref{eq:gender}

\begin{equation}
Identity ≠ Expression ≠ Sex ≠ Attraction
  \label{eq:gender}
\end{equation}

Lets have a look at each of those in turn:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Identity} 🧠 is who you know yourself to be in your own head. Gender identity is based on how much you align (or don't align) with the options for gender based on your psychological sense of self. This includes, but is not limited to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{Woman\ \textbar{}\ Genderqueer\ \textbar{}\ Man} see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary}{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender\_binary} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender}{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary\_gender}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Expression} 🎨 is how you demonstrate your gender based on gender roles through the ways that you act, dress, behave and interact. These are not exclusive categories, you might choose to express yourself in all three ways including:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{Feminine\ \textbar{}\ Androgynous\ \textbar{}\ Masculine} see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression}{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender\_expression}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Sex} ⚧️ is often conflated with gender. Sometimes called anatomical sex or physical sex, your biological sex is objectively measurable using features such as your genitalia, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome}{chromosomes} (your \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-determination_system}{sex-determination system} \texttt{XX}, \texttt{XY} etc), hormones, body hair, ovaries and testes. Your biological sex includes, but is not limited to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{Female\ \textbar{}\ Intersex\ \textbar{}\ Male} see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex}{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Attraction} ❤️ is who you are physically, spiritually and emotionally attracted to. Like biological sex, sexual orientation is often conflated with gender but isn't always a component of gender. We categorise the attraction we experience in gendered ways. Your sexual orientation includes, but is not limited to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{Asexual\ \textbar{}\ Heterosexual\ \textbar{}\ Bisexual\ \textbar{}\ Homosexual} see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation}{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual\_orientation} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)}{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance\_(love)} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality}{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

These characteristics are summarised in the genderbread person shown in figure \ref{fig:genderbread-fig}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Genderbread-Person-v4} 

}

\caption{Decomposing gender into its components of identity (woman-ness \& man-ness), attraction (romantically and sexually), expression (feminity and masculinity) and sex (female-ness \& male-ness).

\end{figure}



Gender is probably more complicated than you realised, but the framework above will help you understand it better or help you explain the subtleties to someone else by breaking a complicated concept into bite-sized, digestible pieces.

\hypertarget{story}{%
\subsection{What's your story, coding glory?}\label{story}}

The protected characteristics described above are the part of your story you'll be most aware of. But there's much more to your story than these characteristics. We're hardwired to love storytelling because it helps us understand the world around us, see figure \ref{fig:storytelling-fig}. We use stories to organise and communicate, so knowing your story is a crucial part of knowing who you are and articulating that to other people.

So, \emph{what's your story, coding glory}? \citep{whatsthestory}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/storytelling} 

}

\caption{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling}{Storytelling} is an ancient art and who doesn't love a good story? As a species \emph{Homo sapiens}, we need to tell and hear stories to understand the world around us. What's your story, coding glory? Public domain image of a painting by John Everett Millais, with a seafarer telling the story of what happened out at sea, via Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/3VHM}{w.wiki/3VHM}}\label{fig:storytelling-fig}
\end{figure}



Self-awareness, understanding who you are, is important for leading a healthy and happy life, and likely to be an important factor in your future success. One way to develop better self-awareness is to think about the finer details of your story. \citep{freeyourstory}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How did you get here?
\item
  What has inspired you?
\item
  Where are you going next?
\item
  Who is the authentic you? \citep{regrets}
\item
  What are your hopes and dreams?
\end{itemize}

By starting to answer these (admittedly \textbf{BIG!}) questions you will gain a better understanding of who you are. This includes your strengths, weaknesses, motivation and values. \citep{parachute2020} Your story is complex but you need to know it so you can distil the details into \emph{much} shorter stories on your job applications described in section \ref{mycvst}. Crucial parts of your story are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Characters}: \emph{Who} are the key people who have influenced your story so far?
\item
  \textbf{Settings}: \emph{Where} and \emph{when} have your stories taken place?
\item
  \textbf{Conflict and change}: Education means bettering yourself which inevitably involves change so:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{How} have your experiences changed you?
  \item
    \emph{What} did you learn from these experiences?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Emotions}: how did you \emph{feel} at the time? Fearful, happy, excited, surprised, empowered? Looking back, how do you feel about these stories now? Have your feelings changed and if so, why?
\end{itemize}

Write these stories down. By reflecting on them and articulating them, you will improve your self awareness. Ultimately, some of these stories can eventually be distilled down into content on your CV (with emotions edited out!), see section \ref{care}.

\hypertarget{hhh}{%
\subsection{Head, heart, hands}\label{hhh}}

Another technique for building your self-awareness is to reflect on your knowledge, values and skills. In \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education}{Waldorf education} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education}{Montessori education} this is characterised as ``head, heart and hands'' outlined below and in figure \ref{fig:headhearthands-fig} \citep{headhearthands}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Head}: What do you \emph{know}?
\item
  \textbf{Heart}: What do you \emph{value}, what motivates you?
\item
  \textbf{Hands}: What can you \emph{do}? What have you \emph{done} so far? What will you do with your skills in the future? Your actions define your impact, see chapter \ref{actioning}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Head, heart and hands} 

}

\caption{What knowledge do you have (\textbf{head})? What are your values (\textbf{heart})? What skills and experience do you have (\textbf{hands})?

\end{figure}



Again, answering these questions will help you understand and articulate your story.

\hypertarget{no42}{%
\subsection{Ikigai: Reason for Being}\label{no42}}

Many of the learning outcomes described above are non-trivial. You may have good self-awareness and be able to describe aspects of who you are in a matter of minutes. Other personality traits make take longer to uncover. You can develop better self-awareness by describing four attributes shown in Figure \ref{fig:iki-fig}, together these are known as your \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai}{ikigai (生き甲斐)} or ``reason for being''.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  what do you love doing?
\item
  what are you good at?
\item
  what does the world need?
\item
  what can you be paid for?
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/IKIGAI-visual-thinkery} 

}

\caption{Reasons for being, a concept in Japanese known as \emph{ikigai}. According to ikigai, the most meaningful life lies at the intersection of four sets: (1) What you are good at, (2) What you love, (3) What the world needs and (4) What you can get paid for. What do \emph{you} have in each of these sets and what are on your personal intersections? Ikigai sketch by \href{https://visualthinkery.com}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:iki-fig}
\end{figure}



You'll be lucky if you can find activities at the intersection of all four sets (\texttt{ikigai}) shown in Figure \ref{fig:iki-fig}. In practice, you may realistically only be able to achieve one, two (the \texttt{Passion}, \texttt{Mission}, \texttt{Profession} and \texttt{Vocation}) or three intersections. That said, it's still a valuable exercise to think about what is in each set for you.

Take a sheet of paper, draw the four overlapping rings shown in Figure \ref{fig:iki-fig}, and spend five to ten minutes adding things in each ring.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What are your values?
\item
  What motivates you?
\item
  Are there things you like doing that you aren't particularly good at?
\item
  Why does that make them enjoyable?
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/Know who you are} 

}

\caption{How well do you know yourself? Know who you are sketch by \href{https://visualthinkery.com}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:know-fig}
\end{figure}



Thinking about your ikigai will clarify your knowledge of yourself.

\hypertarget{personality}{%
\subsection{Personality profiling}\label{personality}}

Personality tests are designed to reveal your key characteristics, see figure \ref{fig:personality-fig}. Besides helping you develop better self-awarness, they are used by some employers during the interview. Personality tests are often part of a wider set of aptitude and psychometric tests to test measure your ability at numerical reasoning, verbal reasoning, logical reasoning and
situational judgement.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/personality-test} 

}

\caption{Personality profiling has been around for a long time. Early theories proposed there were \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_temperaments}{four temperaments}: 1. \texttt{phlegmatic} 2. \texttt{choleric} 3. \texttt{sanguine} and 4. \texttt{melancholic} shown in this 18th century illustration.

\end{figure}



If you haven't done a personality test before, the 16 short questions at \href{https://icould.com/buzz-quiz}{icould.com/buzz-quiz} will give you a flavour of what to expect. Which animal are you? There are lots of tools for personality profiling which go into more depth by asking you a lot more than 16 questions. Some of these services are free such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://www.16personalities.com}{16personalities.com}: similar to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers\%E2\%80\%93Briggs_Type_Indicator}{Myers--Briggs Type Indicators} (MBTI)

\item
  \href{https://www.jobtestprep.co.uk/free-personality-test}{jobtestprep.co.uk/free-personality-test}
\end{itemize}

Different personality tests try to measure various dimensions of your personality such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  your relationship to other people
\item
  your emotional intelligence
\item
  your organisational skills
\item
  your openness to new experiences
\item
  your resilience and mindset
\end{itemize}

Your University may also pay for subscription-based personality profiling services, check with your careers service for details.

\hypertarget{apriv}{%
\subsection{Privilege audit}\label{apriv}}

If you have privileges, it is important to recognise and acknowledge any advantages these have given you in life. They are a key part of your identity, who you are and your ego. If you don't recognise your privileges then you don't know yourself. Ask yourself \emph{honestly}, what privileges do you have? For example, is it \emph{just} your skills and knowledge that have got you into higher education, or have you been fortunate?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Don't have too high an opinion of yourself and your privileges, otherwise you'll overlook your flaws and won't improve
\item
  Be wary of your ego, or as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anderson_(entrepreneur)}{Chris Anderson} puts it in his guide to public speaking: ``park your ego'' \citep{tedtalks}
\item
  If you're struggling to think of any privileges, see section \ref{privileged} for some suggestions.
\end{itemize}

Being mindful of any privileges that you have is not just a part of your identity. Being grateful for those privileges is beneficial for your mental health too, see the discussion of section \ref{lays}.

\hypertarget{regrets}{%
\subsection{Deathbed thought experiment}\label{regrets}}

Imagine for a moment you are on your deathbed. Not at some point in the future, but right now. Your heart (see figure \ref{fig:heart-fig}), which has served you well until now, starts behaving strangely. You start having palpitations, hearing your own heartbeat \citep{elektrokardiogramm} and worry what's going on with the muscle responsible for keeping you alive. Worst case scenario is, your time is up. This happened to me and its a useful \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment}{thought experiment} to force you to think about what matters in your life. \citep{deathbed}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/your-beating-heart}

\caption{One day your heart will stop beating, hopefully not for a long time yet, but it will happen. If you live for an average length of time, your heart will beat more than 2.5 billion times. Now imagine your heart will stop beating in a weeks time. As you reflect on your life, would you have any regrets? If so, what would they be? This \emph{deathbed thought experiment} will force you to think about who you are and what you value.

One of the things you'll probably want to do is reflect on your life and wonder:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What did you achieve?
\item
  Do you have any regrets, if so what are they?
\item
  What would you change if you could carry on living?
\end{itemize}

This can be a useful technique for forcing you to think about who you are and what you value. If you find this activity difficult, see section \ref{regret} for some hints. The Roman's called this \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori}{Memento mori}} which roughly translates from latin as ``remember that you are mortal'' or ``remember that you have to die'' .

Co-founder of \href{https://desana.io/}{desana.io} Michael Cockburn argues that you should ``make decisions as if you were on your deathbed''. \citep{cockburn} Remember that you have to die. \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori}{Memento mori}}. Do you realise that everyone you know someday will die? Instead of saying all of your goodbyes, let them know you realise that life goes fast. It's hard to make the good things last. \citep{doyourealise}

This chapter has looked at some big issues around identity, by inviting you to think about some fundamental questions. Another way to think about these questions is as coding challenges. They are non-trivial questions to answer, it might take you weeks, months or even years to answer some of them. But they are worth spending time thinking about

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What are your values?
\item
  What makes you happy?
\item
  What do you want to get from your time at University?
\item
  What do you want after University?
\item
  Where do you see yourself in \(x\) years time?
\item
  What are your privileges (if any), see section \ref{privileged}
\end{itemize}

The signposts in the next section may help tackle some of these coding challenges.

This chapter challenges you to reflect on who you are and what you're good at. We've only scratched the surface, so if you want to dig deeper you'll find the following resources useful:

\tightlist
\item
  \emph{The Top Five Regrets of the Dying}

\hypertarget{regret}{%
\subsection{Your dying regrets?}\label{regret}}

One of \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Top_Five_Regrets_of_the_Dying}{The Top Five Regrets of the Dying}} \citep{regrets} is that people wish they'd had the courage to live a life true to themselves, and not a life that others expected of them. Figuring out exactly who your authentic self is can be challenging. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronnie_Ware}{Bronnie Ware's} book might help, it has some very moving, personal and insightful true stories of the regrets that people have that will illuminate your own values. The top five regrets, outlined in the book are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me
\item
  I wish I hadn't worked so hard
\item
  I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings
\item
  I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends
\item
  I wish that I had let myself be happier
\end{enumerate}

You need to be courageous to live a regret-free life but the alternative is to die full of regret, see Bronnie's video in figure \ref{fig:bronnie-fig}.

\begin{figure}

\hypertarget{parachute}{%
\subsection{Colouring your parachute}\label{parachute}}

Since first being published in 1972, over ten million copies of \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Color_is_Your_Parachute\%3F}{What Colour is Your Parachute?}} have been sold. It has been translated into 20 languages and is used in 26 countries. What is good about \emph{Parachute} is that it has some useful \emph{self-inventory} exercises that go beyond the introductory ones in this guidebook, particularly in the context of your future career. While the style and examples can be U.S. centric, it's a classic self-help book that looks at a broad variety of issues around job hunting. The author, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nelson_Bolles}{Richard Nelson Bolles} was a Harvard educated chemical engineer and explains how to work out what you'll be doing in five years time in the video in figure \ref{fig:bolles-fig}. He looks at techniques for working our your direction including random luck, intuition and improving self-awareness, using similar techniques to those described in this chapter.

\end{figure}



\hypertarget{freeyourstory}{%
\subsection{What's your story?}\label{freeyourstory}}

A useful technique for developing self-awareness is to think about what your story is. Heather Box and Julian Mocine-McQueen's book \emph{How Your Story Sets You Free} \citep{freeyourstory} takes a storytelling approach to help you gain a better picture of who you are and what you value. What's good about this book is its short, less than 100 pages and contains practical exercises which extend those in this chapter.

\hypertarget{privileged}{%
\subsection{Check your privileges}\label{privileged}}

Reflecting on your identity should lead you to check any privileges you might have. Being grateful for any privileges you may have is also beneficial for your mental health which we talk about in chapter \ref{nurturing} so:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{If you are white} a good place to start understanding your white privileges is \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_I\textquotesingle{}m_No_Longer_Talking_to_White_People_About_Race}{Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race}} by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reni_Eddo-Lodge}{Reni Eddo Lodge} \citep{nottalking} and \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior:_The_Return_of_Race_Science}{Superior: The Return of Race Science}} by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Saini}{Angela Saini}
\item
  \textbf{If you are male} a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of being a man is \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_(book)}{Inferior}} by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Saini}{Angela Saini} \citep{inferior}
\item
  \textbf{If you are socially privileged} a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of your class is \emph{The Class Ceiling: Why it Pays to be Privileged} by Sam Friedman and Daniel Laurison \citep{classceiling}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you were privately (or selectively) educated in Britain (or elsewhere) you should read \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engines_of_Privilege}{Engines of Privilege: Britain's Private School Problem}} \citep{nicebutdim} or \emph{Posh Boys} by Robert Verkaik \citep{poshboys}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{If you are heterosexual} a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of your sexual orientation is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Britton}{Ben Britton}'s presentation on \emph{No sexuality please, we're scientists} \citep{nosex} which covers bisexuality and homosexuality, including lesbian and gay homosexuality
\item
  \textbf{If you are gender binary} a good place to start understanding the privileges you have as a result of being \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary}{gender binary} is Ben Britton's presentation \citep{nosex} which also covers transgender, genderqueer, non-binary and plus identities.
\end{itemize}

If you think you got to where you are purely because of your talents, think again: there's good evidence to show that luck plays a much bigger role than many of us would like to imagine. \citep{luckynottalented} Luck is as much a part of your identity as your talents.

There is a lot more to your identity than your race, class, gender and sexual orientation, see your protected characteristics in section \ref{protected}.

\hypertarget{tldr2}{%
\section{Summarising self awareness}\label{tldr2}}

Too long, didn't read (\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn\%27t_read}{TL;DR})? Here's a summary:

\textbf{Know thyself} was one of three maxims inscribed on the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Apollo_(Delphi)}{Temple of Apollo in Delphi}, in ancient Greece, see figure \ref{fig:delphi-fig}. It's still an important maxim thousands of years later. To know thy future, you must first know thyself.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/know-thyself-delphi}

\caption{\emph{Know thyself} was an important maxim in ancient Greece, written on temples like this one in Delphi. How well do you actually know yourself?

\end{figure}



This chapter has looked at knowing yourself and who you are. Being self aware, understanding your strengths and weaknesses is key to getting what you need from your future. Questions about your identity are non-trivial, hopefully this chapter has started you thinking about who you are, what motivates you and what you want out of life. You will need to keep revisiting these questions about your identity because some aspects of your identity may change over time.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/you-dont-know-you-dont-know}

\caption{You know what you know about your identity and who you are. What parts of your identity do you know you \emph{don't} know?

\end{figure}



What do you know and what don't you know about yourself, see figure \ref{fig:mathers-known-fig}? These fundamental design questions you'll need to address when you starting building your future. This chapter has looked at some simple techniques for exploring your unknown unknowns.

Knowing your future is Coding your Future.

In the next chapter, we'll look at nurturing your future with a focus on mental health.

\hypertarget{nurturing}{%
\chapter{Nurturing your future}\label{nurturing}}

It doesn't matter if you are a student, an employee or even both at the same time. To be successful at studying or working, you need to take your well-being seriously. By well-being, I mean your health and happiness. Your health isn't just about your physical health but also your mental health and the two are very closely linked. It's all too easy when you are busy or stressed to neglect your well-being and then \textbf{bad-stuff™} happens. This chapter looks at your well-being, and how you can nurture it. Because looking after yourself now will also nurture your future. 😀

\section{What you will learn}\label{ilo3}}

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify some of the symptoms of mental ill health in yourself and your peers, particularly anxiety and depression
\item
  Describe five self-help techniques for improving mental health
\item
  Describe services and other people you can approach if you (or someone you know) is being affected by mental ill health and self-help isn't enough
\item
  Schedule activities for improving mental and physical health into your daily or weekly routine
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{genz}{%
\section{Stressed, depressed and exam obsessed?}\label{genz}}

One of the main target audiences for this textbook is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z}{Generation Z}, that's people born sometime between the mid-nineties to early 2000's. There's some evidence to suggest that Gen-Z-ers like you have a higher probability than previous generations of being, as \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist}{The Economist}} puts it:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Stressed
\item
  Depressed
\item
  Exam obsessed
\end{itemize}

Are you stressed? Depressed? Exam obsessed? Are you more worried about getting good grades than drinking too much or having unplanned pregnancies? According to \emph{The Economist} members of Generation Z are more likely to be affected by mental health issues. \citep{generationz} If that's you then you are not alone. Stress, depression and results obsession have been around a while. Many people struggle with them so let's look at them in a bit more detail.

⚠️ \textbf{Coding Caution} ⚠️

I am neither a medical doctor or a psychologist!

This chapter is based on my personal experiences of clinical depression, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant}{antidepressants} and the experience of close friends and colleagues who have been affected by generalised anxiety disorder. So this chapter gives you a quick overview of mental health and points you to where you can find out more.

If you are affected by mental ill health, you should speak to a trained professional.

\hypertarget{illhealth}{%
\section{Mental ill health}\label{illhealth}}

Stress can lead to many kinds of ill health. Turing was put under lots of stress by his government bosses, people like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Denniston}{Alastair Denniston} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Menzies}{Stewart Menzies}. \citep{imitationgame} When asked why he punished himself so much in training (see figure \ref{fig:turing-fig}), Alan Turing's reply is shown in figure \ref{fig:turing-stress-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/turunning-machine} 

}

\caption{When asked why he trained so hard, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing}{Alan Turing} replied: ``I have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard; it's the only way I can get some release''. Like many, Turing found running a relief from the mental pressures he was under in his job. \citep{kottke} Studying can be stressful too and put you under pressure. Your academic performance at University can be significantly improved by taking regular exercise and it will improve your mental health too. Public domain portrait of Alan Turing aged 16 via Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/oZx}{w.wiki/oZx} adapted using the \href{https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238}{Wikipedia app}}\label{fig:turing-stress-fig}
\end{figure}



University is a positive experience for many people, however like Alan, you may also experience periods of stress. This may also be accompanied by anxiety, loneliness and depression. Financial, social and academic pressures alongside concerns about employability, fallout from COVID-19, war in Ukraine and climate change etc can all have an impact on your wellbeing. Statistically, one in four of us will be affected by mental ill health during our lifetime. Two of the most common forms of mental ill health are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Anxiety}: \emph{persistent} feelings of unease, such as worry or fear
\item
  \textbf{Depression}: a low mood that \emph{lasts for a long time} and affects your everyday life. Being affected by depression is \textbf{not} the same as feeling sad
\end{itemize}

The \emph{persistent} and \emph{lasting a long time} are important here because while its part of the human condition to worry and feel sad, that doesn't \emph{necessarily} mean you are affected by poor mental health. How long is a long time? Definitions vary, but around two weeks is a good rule of thumb. There are many forces (\(F\)) at play, feelings of sadness or anxiousness are normally balanced out by counteracting feelings of calm or happiness shown in figure \ref{fig:free-body-fig}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Forces that make you unhappy: \textbf{\(F\)\textsubscript{SAD}}
\item
  Forces that make you happy: \textbf{\(F\)\textsubscript{HAPPY}}
\item
  Forces that make you anxious: \textbf{\(F\)\textsubscript{ANXIOUS}}
\item
  Force that make you calm: \textbf{\(F\)\textsubscript{CALM}}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/Free body diagram} 

}

\caption{Your mental health is like a balloon, acted on by forces of anxiety, calmness, happiness and sadness. These opposing forces normally balance each other out over time. Crudely speaking: (😰 + 😎) + (🙂 + 🙁) = 😐. Good mental health means your balloon stays airborne, despite the inevitable up and downs. If you are affected by poor mental health, feelings of anxiety or sadness will outweigh their counterparts, leading to \emph{persistent} anxiousness or depression. This will cause your balloon (mental health) to ``crash''. This chapter introduces what these mental health issues are and what you can do if you, or someone you know, is affected by poor mental health. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_body_diagram}{Free body diagram} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND} 🎈}\label{fig:free-body-fig}

It might help to conciously list what these forces are so that you are more mindful of them.

\hypertarget{anxiety}{%
\subsection{Anxiety}\label{anxiety}}

Anxiety is one of most common mental health disorders and can lead to depression, increased risk of suicide. Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), a common form of anxiety is explained in the video in Figure \ref{fig:anxious-fig} and at \href{https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder/}{nhs.uk/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder}. People who are affected by anxiety may struggle to function normally, and find routine everyday task difficult or impossible.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/youtube-anxiety}

\end{figure}



\hypertarget{depression}{%
\subsection{Depression}\label{depression}}

Millions of people around the world live with depression. If you are affected by depression it can be really hard to talk about it as there are many social stigmas around mental health. Thankfully depression is largely preventable and treatable. Recognising depression and seeking help is the first and most critical step towards recovery. To mark \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day}{World Mental Health Day} writer and illustrator Matthew Johnstone tells the story of how he overcame the ``black dog of depression'' in the video in Figure \ref{fig:sad-fig} made in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO).

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}



A common issue with poor mental health is that the people affected often don't realise they need help, partly because of the social stigmas that prevent people talking about mental health in the first place. Computer Scientist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Cliff_(computer_scientist)}{Dave Cliff} explains how he recognised he was being affected by poor mental health in figure \ref{fig:cliff-fig}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \href{https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtELvV8-OK0}{\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/cliff-fig-1} }

\caption{``When you haven't slept a wink for five days, the madness arrives in the post very quickly afterwards''. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Cliff_(computer_scientist)}{Dave Cliff} at the University of Bristol explains how he dealth with poor mental health, severe anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. \citep{thecliff} You can also watch the watch the 7 minute video embedded in this figure at \href{https://youtu.be/OtELvV8-OK0}{youtu.be/OtELvV8-OK0} \citep{youtube-davecliff}}\label{fig:cliff-fig}

Just \emph{talking} about mental health issues is an important step in removing the social stigmas that surround them.

\hypertarget{drugs}{%
\subsection{Drugs}\label{drugs}}

Prescription medication can help some people with their mental health. For example, when I was affected by depression, \href{https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ssri-antidepressants/}{Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors} (SSRIs) worked for me, shown in Figure \ref{fig:citalopram-fig}, but they don't for everybody. Sometimes the drugs don't work, they just make you worse. \citep{drugsdontwork}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/citalopram}

\caption{\href{https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/citalopram/}{Citalopram} is a type of antidepressant known as a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI).

\end{figure}



Some doctors prescribe \href{https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/sleeping-pills-and-minor-tranquillisers/about-benzodiazepines/}{benzodiazepines} for anxiety, which may be effective where SSRI's are not, but these can be addictive and have big side effects.

It is worth considering \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy}{cognitive behavioural therapy} (CBT) before taking any medication. \emph{The Science of Wellbeing} (TSOWB) at \href{https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being}{coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being} is an easy way to access some CBT free online, see the signposts section (section \ref{signposts3}) at the end of this chapter. \citep{lauriesantos}

If you're feeling suicidal, you don't have to struggle with difficult feelings alone. If you're suffering from emotional distress or struggling to cope a Samaritan can face your problems with you. Whatever you're going through, \href{https://www.samaritans.org/}{samaritans.org} are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They respond to around 10,000 calls for help in the UK every day. No judgement. No pressure. Call them free any time, from any phone (in the UK) on 116 123. It's important to talk to \emph{somebody}, see figure \ref{fig:joydivision-fig}.

In retrospect it is obvious when you read his lyrics \citep{isolation}. However, people who are affected by poor mental health often don't talk about it until it is too late - so it can be tricky to diagnose and help them in time.

Suicide is the biggest killer of under 35's in the UK. Like many young men, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Curtis}{Ian Curtis} in figure \ref{fig:joydivision-fig} tragically took his own life when he was just 23 years old. Globally, over 700,000 people die due to suicide every year, see \href{https://www.who.int/health-topics/suicide}{who.int/health-topics/suicide}. Every life lost to suicide is a tragedy because suicide is preventable, by talking and listening. If you're feeling suicidal or you know someone who is, don't suffer (or let others suffer) in silence. Check out the resources in section \ref{samaritans} and \ref{papryus}.

Looking after yourself can serve to both prevent and treat mental health issues that can affect you in life. You might be your own worst critic, or perhaps when you're under pressure you neglect things that are proven to be beneficial for your mental health, like sleep, exercise, mindfulness and friendship. Looking after yourself means at least three things:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  being mindful of your feelings and learning to manage your inner critic
\item
  being kind to yourself in various ways
\item
  deliberately scheduling protected time to do the non-work things that matter.
\end{itemize}

Harvard Psychologist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_R._Santos}{Laurie Santos} describes five evidence-based strategies for coping when times are really challenging and tough in the video in figure \ref{fig:laurie-fig}. Those strategies are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Exercise}: getting regular exercise improves both physical AND mental health.
\item
  \textbf{Gratitude}: research shows that being grateful can significantly improve your mental health. One way to do this is by keeping a gratitude journal, a log you fill in everyday of things you are grateful for. This can include both the small and big things in life.
\item
  \textbf{Sleep}: actively developing healthier sleep patterns. Poor sleep hygiene can be both cause and effect of poor mental health. See the discussion of \emph{Why we sleep} \citep{whywesleep} in section \ref{signposts3}
\item
  \textbf{Socialising}: give a higher priority to spending time with friends and family. There is good evidence to show this will make you happier than turning inward or diving deeper into work which could just make you more stressed, depressed or anxious \citep{lauranxiety}
\item
  \textbf{Mindfulness}: be mindful of emotions using the R.A.I.N. technique:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{R}ecognise: negative emotions
  \item
    \textbf{A}ccept: accept and allow emotions rather than fighting or ignoring them
  \item
    \textbf{I}nvestigate: notice how the emotion feels inside your body
  \item
    \textbf{N}urture: be kind to yourself, step away from your emotions by distancing yourself from them.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

It can help to think of negative emotions as coming from another person, an inner critic, rather than yourself. You are not your emotions and thoughts. Laurie explains the R.A.I.N. technique in figure \ref{fig:laurie-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \href{https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCQim9VrnDY}{\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/laurie-fig-1} }

\caption{Laurie Santos describes five coping techniques for improving wellbeing: Exercise, gratitude, sleep, getting social and meditation. You can also watch the six minute video embedded in this figure at \href{https://youtu.be/kCQim9VrnDY}{youtu.be/kCQim9VrnDY} \citep{youtube-santos}.}\label{fig:laurie-fig}
\end{figure}



The techniques described by Santos are not merely trashy \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_psychology}{pop psychology} but scientifically proven techniques. \citep{yaden} So there are some simple things you can do to help yourself, but you may also need to seek help from others.

\hypertarget{burnout}{%
\section{Burnout}\label{burnout}}

Sometimes a desire to be productive by overworking has exactly the opposite effect, because the sacrifices you make for work can be counter-productive. If you burn too brightly you might burnout completely, see \href{https://mentalhealth-uk.org/burnout/}{mentalhealth-uk.org/burnout}. 🔥

Sacrificing sleep, socialising, exercise and time-out to recharge your batteries can make you \emph{less} productive, especially in the longer term.

I'm \textbf{not} saying don't work hard. Like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nurse}{Paul Nurse}, I am arguing that you shouldn't work \emph{too} hard:

\begin{quote}
``if you really want to be good you musn't work too hard. If you work too hard just hard all the
time you will keep going in the same direction. One big advantage of taking some relaxation is it
makes your brain come down and then you come and look at it freshly. When you take off the
pressure, to go off and go and walk for day then you can imagine new things.''

\hfill --- Paul Nurse \citep{paulnurse}
\end{quote}

So work hard but don't overwork. Overworking \href{https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210518-how-overwork-is-literally-killing-us}{will literally kill you}. \citep{overworking}

If you're making to many sacrifices to get the grades you want, ask yourself, is it really worth it. See section \ref{entitled}, \ref{regret} and read \href{https://on.ft.com/3Cc4Ynh}{Is a first class degree really that important}? You may need to recalibrate your relationship and expectations of work to either recover from burnout, or stop burning out in the first place \citep{happyburnout}

\hypertarget{notalone}{%
\section{Help is available if you need it}\label{notalone}}

If you are affected by mental ill health, particularly anxiety or depression, it can be hard:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  to recognise that you need help in the first place
\item
  to help yourself using self-help resources
\item
  to ask others to help you
\end{itemize}

Even if you don't need help, it is important to recognise and understand the symptoms of mental ill health. It's quite likely that someone you know will suffer from mental health issues and as their friend or peer, it might be you that can help by encouraging them to get the help they wouldn't otherwise ask for.

\textbf{You are not alone}, help is available if you (or your friends) need it from a wide variety of sources:

\hypertarget{unihelp}{%
\subsection{Your University}\label{unihelp}}

There are lots of people who can help you:

\begin{itemize}

\hypertarget{growthmindset}{%
\section{Developing a growth mindset}\label{growthmindset}}

Learning at University can be hard because you might have gone from being at (or near) the top of the class in high school to no longer being top of the class at University.

Likewise the job hunting described in chapter \ref{finding} can take a heavy toll on your mental health because repeated rejection is an ordinary part of the process. It can be time consuming, stressful and demoralising. You may find your applications disappear into a black hole. They will be ghosted (ignored) by employers. Interviewers will blank you and refuse to give you meaningful feedback because they're too busy. This could happen multiple times. This is all \emph{\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/par_for_the_course}{par for the course}}, normal and expected, and is not necessarily a reflection on your abilities or potential. See the examples in the coding interview section \ref{codinginterview}. \citep{youtube-petia}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/the-fixed-mindset} 

}

\caption{A fixed mindset is monolithic like the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moai}{Easter island statues (moʻai)}. If you're not already, you should be wary of a fixed mindset. \href{https://bryanmmathers.com/fixed-mindsets/}{Fixed mindsets} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:fixedminset-fig}
\end{figure}



Adopting a growth mindset can be a successful strategy for maintaining your wellbeing, see figure \ref{fig:fixedminset-fig}. If your grades aren't has good as you hoped or your search for employment is being met with repeated rejection, a growth mindset can help. Let's take rejection from potential employers as an example, there are two ways you can react to it:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Fixed mindset}}: responding with a fixed mindset will mean you are likely to take rejection personally. You might even assume that this confirms what you've always suspected. You're not good enough or that you made some fatal mistake in your applications or interviews. Ouch.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Growth mindset}}: by responding to rejection with a growth mindset, you focus on what happens next. Rejection is not failure but a ``not yet'' described in figure \ref{fig:not-fig}. Maybe you're not yet ready for that employer, but you'll definitely have a good idea of what you learned from the process and how can you do better next time.
\end{enumerate}

According to Stanford psychologist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck}{Carol Dweck} we can all be placed on a spectrum describing where we think our abilities come from. At one end, the fixed mindset assumes all kinds of abilities are fixed traits while at the other end, a growth mindset assumes these abilities can be developed over time. \citep{dweck} There is good evidence that adopting a growth mindset will make you a better learner who can cope with the inevitable failures and rejections in life better. This approach can be used in a range of different disciplines such as learning programming languages \citep{Cutts2010}, music \citep{Davis2016} and job hunting.

\hypertarget{signposts3}{%
\section{Wellbeing signposts}\label{signposts3}}

This chapter has looked at your wellbeing and especially the role that both your mental health and physical health play in your future. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Haig}{Matt Haig}'s first-hand accounts of poor mental health will be comforting to anyone who is affected by mental ill health. Even if you're not affected, there is a 25\% chance you will be at some point in your life. There's also a high probability someone close to you will suffer from mental health issues. It might be a colleague, friend, family member, fellow student or partner, so it is worth educating yourself on the issues by reading his two short books:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Notes on a Nervous Planet} is a personal account of anxiety \citep{nervousplanet}
\item
  \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasons_to_Stay_Alive}{Reasons to Stay Alive}} is a personal account of depression \citep{stayalive}
\end{enumerate}

What's good about Matt Haig's books is they are quick and easy to read, but give plenty of first-hand insight into what mental ill-health can do to people (including you). Matt describes his top five tips for good mental health in figure \ref{fig:haig-fig}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \href{https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMm5kiiMjTM}{\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/haig-fig-1} }

There's plenty of evidence that social media can have a detrimental effect on health. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier}{Jaron Lanier}'s skeptical polemic \emph{Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now} \citep{lanier} is a thought-provoking romp through some of the pitfalls of social media that may have you reaching for the delete or un-install button fairly quickly. You don't have to be on social media, see figure \ref{fig:socialmedia-fig}.

\begin{figure}

If all these books are making you sleepy, neuroscientist Matthew Walker's \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Sleep}{Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams}} may change your view on the importance of a good nights sleep. \citep{whywesleep}

Finally, it's well worth taking a look at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_R._Santos}{Laurie Santos} course on \emph{The Science of Wellbeing} (TSOWB) at \href{https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being}{coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being}. \citep{lauriesantos} TSOWB course provides an alternative to medication as it follows the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

TSOWB is the most popular course at Yale University and looks at some simple techniques you can use to improve your happiness. \citep{happinessny} The course will help you increase your happiness and build more productive habits. Using the latest research, Santos describes the misconceptions about happiness and ``annoying features'' of your mind that can impair your well-being. The course takes about 19 hours to complete but you can spread this over a whole semester (or longer) if you choose. The short clip in figure \ref{fig:laurie-fig} gives you a brief taster of Laurie's style and work.

\end{figure}



Anxiety and depression are serious conditions that are very likely to affect you or somebody close to you while you are at University. There's a one in four chance that you will be affected by mental health issues at some point in your life.

We've only talked about two particular mental health issues, anxiety and depression, but there are many other conditions such as phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, self-harm and more that are beyond the scope of this chapter. They do have one thing in common, and that is that talking about them is an important part of starting to develop better mental health. Mental health can affect everyone, all genders, classes and races.

If you are affected by mental ill health, talking about it is the best place to start, but often the hardest. You can continue by:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Accepting yourself for who you are, see chapter \ref{knowing}
\item
  Learning to identify and challenge unhelpful thinking patterns
\item
  Avoiding the trap of compare yourself to other people too much
\end{enumerate}

\ldots{} are three more steps you can take to help yourself, see figure \ref{fig:mindyourhealth-fig}. In this chapter, I've outlined some ways you can help yourself alongside some of the services and people you can talk to if you need to.

Despite how you might feel, you are not alone.

Nurturing your future is Coding your future.

\chapter{Writing your future}\label{writing}}

We all have strengths and weaknesses, and for~students of Computer Science, it is often their communication skills that let them down. Other chapters in this guidebook discuss the fundamental communication skills of \href{https://www.cdyf.me/speaking}{speaking}, \href{https://www.cdyf.me/hearing}{listening} and \href{https://www.cdyf.me/reading}{reading}.

\item
  every \emph{engineer}~is also a writer, and good engineers have good written communication skills
\item
  every \emph{scientist} is also a writer, and good scientists also have good written communication skills too

\hypertarget{softwrite}{%
\section{Writing as a soft social skill}\label{softwrite}}

Your soft social skills will take a \textbf{life time} to develop and are \textbf{really hard} use. Why? Because soft skills are about \emph{communicating} with and \emph{understanding} other people so that you can work \emph{together} as a team toward a shared goal. Your soft skills are hard.

There are very few jobs where you work on your own in complete isolation. For example, most software and hardware is designed, built, tested and used by teams of people. Many of these teams are large and have very diverse membership. This means that sooner or later you're going to have to master the dark arts of \emph{working with other people} by developing and deploying your softer skills. One of those softer skills you'll need to continuously develop is written communication.

Communicating with other people and working in teams is inherently difficult because we're all human. There is good news and bad news\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{THE GOOD NEWS} is, people can be diligent, humble, competent, honest, caring and reliable. They can be co-operative, generous, supportive, kind, thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive, understanding, punctual and professional too!
\item
  \textbf{THE BAD NEWS} is, unfortunately people can also be lazy, stupid, ignorant, vain, incompetent, dishonest, unreliable, greedy, egomaniacal, unpredictable and moody. They can be proud, selfish, competitive, lustful, angry, envious, mean, busy, insensitive and thoughtless too. Some will disagree with you, boss you around, betray, exploit, misunderstand and mislead you, deliberately or otherwise. \citep{sevendeadly}
\end{itemize}

This \emph{shouldn't} be news to you but it means communicating with and understanding other people can be hard work, but don't worry, \textbf{everyone} finds this challenging, it's not just you! It doesn't matter if you're an extrovert or an introvert, communication is a challenge for everybody, and everyone can get better at it too. It's easy to undervalue the importance of communication because we do it everyday. Scientists and engineers can be particularly bad at this, often overlooking the importance of written and spoken language. It probably doesn't help that in the UK, and many other countries, many students in the latter stages of their education, choose either

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  an exclusively scientific-mathematical path OR
\item
  an ``arty'' humanities path
\end{itemize}

This means that \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures}{the two cultures} of humanities and science are thriving, but still living in separate houses like an estranged and bickering couple. \citep{twocultures} In the worst case scenario, two cultures in society produces:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  graduate scientists and engineers with weaker communication and literacy skills
\item
  articulate and literate humanities graduates with weaker technical \& numeracy skills
\end{enumerate}

Are you in the first category? This chapter takes a look at the softer skill of written communication and techniques you can use to improve your writing. Whatever mood your readers are in, they'll find it a lot easier to work with you when you can express yourself clearly in writing.

\hypertarget{superpower}{%
\section{Computing is your superpower!}\label{superpower}}

Studying computer science gives you an \emph{awesome} superpower. We will look at some of the reasons why in chapter \ref{computing} on \emph{Computing your Future}. But for now, let us just acknowledge that hard technical skills like computing are highly sought after and valuable, both commercially and otherwise.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Achilles-Heel-to-Superpower} 

}

\caption{Computing is a superpower that gods like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes}{Hermes} and mortal heroes like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles}{Achilles} would probably have envied. \citep{heroes, mythos} As a technical or \emph{hard skill}, computing is a crucial weapon in your armoury but what are your weaker skills? What is your \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles\%27_heel}{Achilles' heel}? For some scientists and engineers, their weakness is their soft skills, such as communication. Writing, reading, speaking and listening to communicate with team members can be a weaker skill for many technical people. This chapter looks at what you can do to improve these skills and convince employers that you are rounded individual with a healthy balance of soft and hard skills. \href{https://bryanmmathers.com/achilles-heel-to-superpower/}{Achilles heel to superpower} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:achilles-fig}
\end{figure}



Your computational superpower is less powerful if it isn't complemented by a broad range of softer skills. Typically, these skills are not closely examined in most computer science degrees, for example by repeated assessment. There's an awful lot of \href{https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations}{technical computing curriculum} that tends to have a higher priority over soft skills. It's not that soft skills aren't important but that they can be hard to quantify.

For example, if I want to know how good you are at understanding the syntax and semantics of a programming language like Python, there are tried and tested techniques for measuring this. However, if I want to know how good you are at using your communication skills to work in a team of engineers to negotiate, lead, resolve conflicts, persuade others, show empathy etc that's \textbf{much} harder to measure accurately. What technical degrees tend to measure is technical skills because softer skills, shown in figure \ref{fig:allskills-fig}, are much harder to assess by examination and coursework. This is one of the many reasons that you are much more than your grades, see figure \ref{fig:more-than-grades-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Hard and soft skills} 

}

\caption{Hard skills and soft skills aren't much use without each other. You will need both to survive and thrive but most science and engineering education focuses on your hard skills, not your soft skills. Why? Because hard skills are often much easier to measure.

\end{figure}



Let's look at some of low-level communication skills (\texttt{I/O}) that they are built on.

\hypertarget{cio}{%
\section{Communication I/0}\label{cio}}

In terms of input and output, your fundamental communication skills are listening, speaking, reading and writing words in natural languages shown in table \ref{tab:iotable}. These are the ``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language}{assembly languages}'' of human communication. This might sound blindingly obvious, but these skills are often under-estimated or undervalued by engineers and scientists, especially undergraduates. Alongside verbal and written communication, there's also nonverbal language, or body language such as eye contact, gestures and facial expressions.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:iotable}The inputs and outputs of the fundamental assembly languages of human communication }
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lll}
\toprule
 & Input & Output\\
\midrule
Written natural language & Reading & Writing\\
Spoken natural language & Listening & Speaking\\
Nonverbal language & Observing other people & Being observed by others\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Some people leave plenty of room for improvement when it comes to the communication skills outlined in table \ref{tab:iotable}. Think of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the stereotypical mad scientist, clad in a white coat, unable to explain the complexities of their research to people inside their lab, let alone outside of it, see figure \ref{fig:madscientist-fig}
\item
  the nerdy software engineer stereotype who prefers the company of computers to people
\end{itemize}

Yes, these are lazy tropes and unhelpful stereotypes, but they express public perception of scientists and engineers as poor communicators. Don't perpetuate the stereotype by being a bad communicator.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/mad-scientist}

\caption{Are you \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad,_Bad_and_Dangerous_to_Know}{mad, bad and dangerous to know}? You'll be familiar with the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_scientist}{mad scientist stereotype}: perceived as an evil genius owing to a combination of unsettling personality traits and the unabashedly ambitious, taboo or hubristic nature of their experiments. Besides their supposed insanity, another reason mad scientists (and engineers) are perceived badly, is their poor communication skills. Maybe if they could communicate better the public might understand and trust them more? Don't perpetuate the stereotype by being a poor communicator, there are too many of those already!

\hypertarget{mightier}{%
\subsection{The pen is mightier than the sword}\label{mightier}}

The art of communication is a huge subject which extends far beyond the scope of this guidebook. So for the rest of this chapter, we'll focus on your superpower of written communication. The pen (and keyboard) are mightier than the sword, see figure \ref{fig:mighty-pen-fig}.

\end{figure}



Written communication skills are important because:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Good writing and reading are crucial in applications} for employment and further study. From writing CV's, covering letters, completing application forms and reading job specifications, and employer (or course) information, your ability to read and write in natural languages is crucial to coding your future.
\item
  \textbf{Writing often gets neglected}: Written communication skills (both reading and writing) are sometimes sidelined in science and engineering degrees. This is particularly true in the ``hard sciences''. For example, communicating and solving problems using code or mathematics are usually the dominant forms of assessment in computer science courses. That's understandable given the subject, but tends to push natural languages (like english) to the sidelines.
\item
  \textbf{Good engineers are also good writers} Many engineers (and scientists) could significantly improve their written communication skills. Software engineers are notoriously bad at writing, see for example \href{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/960492.960525}{Why Computer Science Students Need Language}, \citep{Beaubouef2003} \emph{Scientists Must Write} \citep{scientistsmustwrite} and \href{https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-real-reason-silicon-valley-coders-write-bad-software/263377/}{The Real Reason Silicon Valley Coders Write Bad Software}, \citep{writebadsoftware} just three examples amongst many others making exactly the same point. Employers like Google provide training (and a whole career path) for technical writers, see \href{https://developers.google.com/tech-writing}{developers.google.com/tech-writing}. I'm glad they exist, but these careers and courses wouldn't be needed if software engineers were better at documenting, explaining and communicating with other human beings in the first place!
\item
  \textbf{Writing good english is like writing good code}. Some of the skills you already have in coding can be transferred to written communication. Just like a good \texttt{function}, \texttt{class} or \texttt{method} in code should be well-defined with a clear purpose, your writing should also be clear and coherent. Well structured writing is a lot like well architected software too, with a clear \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns}{separation of concerns} (SoC)
\item
  \textbf{It is relatively easy to improve} your written communication skills, simply by reading and writing more. Reading and writing deliberately every day, will significantly improve these skills. See the rest of this chapter for some simple exercises to get started with and:

\hypertarget{nle}{%
\subsection{Natural language engineering}\label{nle}}

As a species, we've been writing stuff down for millenia in order to communicate with each other, see figure \ref{fig:rosetta-fig}. If you stop to think about it, engineers and scientists spend a \emph{lot} time communicating in writing. As well as engineering \texttt{code}, they also spend a significant amount of time engineering \emph{messages} in natural languages like english.

\begin{figure}

What do they all have in common? They're all written in natural languages like the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language}{English language}, but without them, the software or hardware they describe and discuss would be useless. Using written (and spoken) natural language is a key social skill and a communication skill. You might be using your language to influence, persuade, convince or argue with members of your team. So it is important that you do it to the best of your abilities. Computer Scientist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_von_Ahn}{Luis von Ahn}, shown in figure \ref{fig:vonahn-fig}, is the creator of \href{https://www.duolingo.com/}{Duolingo.com}. Luis regrets that he didn't spend any effort developing his social skills early in his career. Instead, like many computer scientists he focussed his effort on his mathematical and technical skills instead. \citep{vonahn}

\begin{figure}

Making software isn't all about what you can do as an individual but rather how you communicate with and contribute to your team. It's easy to get carried away with your ego. Remember that most jobs require \emph{lots} of softer people skills and collaboration, written communication is a huge part of that, alongside spoken communication see for example \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ}{The Myth of the Genius Programmer}. \citep{Fitzpatrick}

\hypertarget{therapy}{%
\subsection{Writing as therapy}\label{therapy}}

Besides being a tool for communication, writing can be therapeutic for the writer too. The simple act of writing can help you tackle mental health issues discussed in chapter \ref{nurturing}. Prime minister \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill}{Winston Churchill} found that writing helped to keep the ``black dog'' of his depression under control, see section \ref{depression} and figure \ref{fig:winston-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/churchill}

\caption{Winston Churchill managed to regulate his depression by writing. If you are affected by anxiety or depression, you may find that private forms of writing like those described in section \ref{dailywrite} will help to improve your mental health.

So writing can be therapeutic, a powerful tool for developing \href{https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/tips-and-support/mindfulness/}{mindfulness} as well as communicating with other people.

\hypertarget{wyf}{%

Hopefully I've convinced you that written communication skills (both as a writer and reader) are important soft skills that engineers often neglect. So how can you improve?

\hypertarget{dogfooding}{%
\subsection{Dogfooding}\label{dogfooding}}

Many employers test their products and services by trialling them on their own employees, this is known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food}{eating your own dogfood} shown in figure \ref{fig:dogfooding-fig}. Tasty, tasty dogfood. 🐶

\begin{figure}

\caption{Reading your own writing (aloud) is like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food}{eating your own dog food}. It's a simple and proven technique for improving your written communication in job applications such as covering letters, CVs, personal statements and the like.

\end{figure}



Dogfooding is a simple technique for testing your own writing. Let's say you've just written a personal statement or covering letter (see section \ref{we3qs}). It's natural to read it over in your head to check for errors, before you send it. However, \textbf{reading it aloud} will pick up errors you may not have spotted by reading silently. Your ears and tongue will pick up on awkward phrases and sentences that your eyes didn't spot. There's something about articulating words out loud that flushes out errors you don't pick up when you read them in your head. Dogfooding is a tried and tested technique. It also means you're ready to vocalise those answers in an interview.

You might want to choose carefully where you do this as it might look a bit strange, but it works well. If you talk into a mobile phone while looking at a piece of paper, people won't notice you're talking to yourself. But you'll probably need some privacy as the stuff you're talking about is likely to be personal. Alternatively, find a critical friend who you can read out loud to. You can also use a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader}{screen reader}, for example :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Microsoft Teams has an \href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/education/products/learning-tools}{immersive reader}
\item
  Android devices have \href{https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6007100}{TalkBack}
\item
  Apple devices have \href{https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph3e2e415f/ios}{VoiceOver}
\end{itemize}

A screen reader will often reveal mistakes you haven't spotted by reading your text silently.

Google occasionally delivers these technical writing courses as free sessions open to the general public. For details, see \href{https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/announcements}{developers.google.com/tech-writing/announcements} for details.

\hypertarget{dailywrite}{%
\subsection{Deliberate daily writing}\label{dailywrite}}

Another technique for improving your written communication is to write something every day, that might be a personal diary that only you read, or it could be something more public like blog. Schedule a time every day, say 15 to 30 minutes when you will do this without fail. That writing could take several forms:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  public web log or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog}{blog}
\item
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal}{gratitude journal} see section \ref{lays}
\item
  private diary or personal laboratory notebook
\item
  morning pages, a unedited stream of conciousness that can help you become more creative \citep{cameron, burkeman}
\item
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal}{bullet journal}. Some people swear by it, see \href{https://bulletjournal.com/}{bulletjournal.com}
\end{itemize}

The technique of \emph{30 minutes per day} can be a very effective way of getting things done, incrementally over time. In my experience it works for lots of things besides writing including getting exercise (discussed in chapter \ref{nurturing}) to gardening. \citep{leendertz}

\hypertarget{dailyread}{%
\subsection{Deliberate daily reading}\label{dailyread}}

Reading other people's code will improve your software engineering skills. Likewise, reading other peoples writing will improve your natural language engineering skills. Read anything, it might be novels, magazines, newspapers, stuff online or any of the books cited in chapter \ref{reading}. Find a time and place to do this every day and stick to it, see figure \ref{fig:reading-fig}

\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn\%27t_read}{Too long, didn't read} (TL;DR)? Here's a summary:

You'll need both soft and hard skills to compete in the workplace. Don't underestimate the importance of softer skills, we've looked briefly at written communication skills in this chapter but that's only the tip of the soft skills iceberg.

Teamwork, negotiation, conflict resolution, public speaking, motivating others and leadership are also important soft skills too. How can you develop these skills while at University? How can you demonstrate to potential employers that you have these skills? Your technical skills are of limited use without people skills, to allow you to work with others see figure \ref{fig:otherpeople-fig}.

In the longer term, you will benefit from constantly improving your softer skills and providing evidence of them to potential employers. Written communication is just one of those softer skills.

\chapter{Computing your future}\label{computing}}

It's difficult to think of any aspect of our lives that hasn't been changed by the invention of the digital programmable computer, just 74 short years ago. \citep{lavington} Consequently, computing is a crucial skill in a wide range of careers across every sector of business and society. You don't have to have studied Computer Science at University to take advantage of all the exciting opportunities provided by computing. This chapter looks at why computing is a subject for everyone. If you're studying computing, this chapter isn't aimed at you, unless you are struggling to stay motivated with your subject! 👨🏿‍💻👨‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩‍💻👨🏿‍💻

\section{What you will learn}\label{ilo6}}

Reading this chapter and doing the activities will help you to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify where you can get started with computing, if you're not studying computer science as a major part of your degree
\item
  Describe why NOT studying computer science doesn't necessarily ``lock you out'' of computing as a career
\end{enumerate}

But why should everyone be studying computing? There are social and economic arguments:

\hypertarget{creative}{%
\section{Computing is for everybody}\label{creative}}

At school, everyone learns to read, write and do maths. These are sometimes known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_three_Rs}{the three Rs} but:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Why did you learn to read and write? Was it so that you could become a professional writer?
\item
  Why did you study mathematics? Was it so that you could become a professional mathematician?
\end{itemize}

Of course not, that would be ludicrous! You learned to read and write because they are fundamental tools for expressing yourself and communicating with other people. You studied maths so that you could develop numeracy, reason about the world around you, analyse data and solve problems.

So why should everyone learn about computing? Is it so that everyone can become software engineers? Again, this is patently ludicrous.

Everyone should study computing for the same reasons everyone studies maths and english at school. Like writing, computing is one of the most creative tools for expression and communication that we have today. Just like mathematics, studying computing will also help you to solve important problems too. Sam Aaron, creator of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Pi}{Sonic Pi}, puts exactly this case for creative computing in his TEDx talk \citep{youtube-sonicpi} shown in figure \ref{fig:sonicpi-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \href{https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lTZ8Tuyu5I}{\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/sonicpi-fig-1} }

\end{figure}



Computing is also an intellectually stimulating and challenging subject to study in its own right. If you don't believe me, I'm not going to make the case here. If you are a humanities student, have a look at Silvio Peroni's free computational thinking and programming textbook at \href{https://comp-think.github.io/}{comp-think.github.io}. \citep{peroni} If you like doing \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course}{Massive Open Online Courses} (MOOCs), you might also enjoy \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CS50}{CS50}, with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Malan}{David Malan} shown in figure \ref{fig:malan-fig}.

\hypertarget{seating}{%
\section{Software is eating your future}\label{seating}}

Whatever future world you enter into after you graduate, there's a good chance it has already been eaten by software. In 2011, the software engineer and billionaire investor \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen}{Marc Andreesen} outlined why (in his opinion, figure \ref{fig:eating-fig}) software is eating the world, in \emph{The Wall Street Journal} \citep{eatingtheworld}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/software-is-eating-the-world} 

}

\caption{Whatever world you enter after you graduate, software has either eaten it, currently eating it or working out how to do so. Andreessen explains \href{https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/}{why software is eating the world} and your future with it.

\end{figure}



Unfortunately, many people lack the digital skills required to take advantage of all the opportunities provided by software and computing. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)}{Robert Sedgwick} at Princeton University has, like many others, argued that Computer Science should be a \textbf{required} topic of study for \emph{all} undergraduate students in University. \citep{robertsedgwick} We're not there yet because computing is a subject that has historically been siloed in Computer Science Departments, but this is changing as we'll see in this chapter. It's not that everyone should jump ship to Computer Science, but that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Computing is too important to be left to Computer Scientists
\item
  \href{https://www.bcs.org/content-hub/computings-too-important-to-be-left-to-men/}{Computing is too important to be left to men} \citep{sparckjones}
\end{itemize}

Whatever subject you are currently studying, adding some computing to your education will empower you with the computational thinking skills you need to be an active producer, not just a passive consumer in modern society. Computing can open up new opportunities for you and improve your social mobility.

\hypertarget{eating}{%
\section{Computing is eating the world}\label{eating}}

Besides the social arguments, there are also strong economic reasons for studying computing. It's not just software that's eating the world, but its combination with hardware that dominates the list of the world's largest corporations by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization}{market capitalisation}, shown in figure \ref{fig:market-fig}. What use is software without hardware?

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Market_Capitalisation} 

}

\caption{If stock markets are anything to go by, computing is eating the world. It would be impossible for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech}{Big Tech} companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Meta (Facebook) to exist without computing. The ten largest corporations by market capitalisation (as of 2022) graphic by YBSLE/\href{https://laboussole.coop/}{laboussole.coop} on Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/3KEU}{w.wiki/3KEU}}\label{fig:market-fig}
\end{figure}



Even if you don't want to work for any of these global oligopolies, their success is good news for \emph{all} students of computing because it shows how important computation is to society, both commercially and otherwise. Another visualisation of data in figure \ref{fig:market-fig} is shown in figure \ref{fig:market-again-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Biggest-Companies-in-the-World} 

}

\caption{The Biggest Companies in the World based on market capitalisation data from PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC), as well as the countries and sectors they are from.

\end{figure}



What figure \ref{fig:market-fig} and figure \ref{fig:market-again-fig} show is that computing is eating the stock market. This means that commercial demand for software developers is high, comparable to teaching and nursing in terms of raw numbers. In the UK, the most common jobs for graduates from 2019 are shown in figure \ref{fig:nurses-fig}, based on data taken from an \href{https://luminate.prospects.ac.uk/uk-graduate-labour-market-update-11-january}{update on the graduate labour market in 2022} \citep{labourmarket2022}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/nurses-fig-1} 

}

\caption{The top ten professions in the UK in 2019 based on numbers of graduates starting work, shown on the x axis. In 2019, 4340 graduates started a job in the UK job as a software developer (or programmer), with many developer vacancies unfilled. So, demand for software developers is high, comparable to teachers and nurses, according to data published by prospects.ac.uk \citep{labourmarket2022}}\label{fig:nurses-fig}
\end{figure}



So if you can develop software, there's lots of choice and opportunities on offer. Although the data in figure \ref{fig:nurses-fig} is from the UK, the story is the same in many other countries around the world.

Demand for developers is high, with many job vacancies going unfilled.

\hypertarget{passive}{%
\section{Passive consumer or active producer?}\label{passive}}

All this choice is a great thing but what sort of role do you want computing to play in your career? You can either be a passive consumer of computing or you can be an active producer, shaping the world of computing to get want you want from it, rather than what it wants from you. Going back to Andreesen's eating analogy in section \ref{seating}, the choice is to be an \emph{eater} or be \emph{eaten}. Or to use a gaming analogy, \emph{play} or be \emph{played}.

\hypertarget{joker}{%
\section{Play your joker: Computational joker}\label{joker}}

Because of its social and economic importance, computing also gives you flexible career options. If academic disciplines are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card_suit}{playing card suits}, then Computer Science is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(playing_card)}{joker in the pack} shown in figure \ref{fig:joker-fig}. A versatile card, the computational joker can be played with (and without) \emph{any} of the traditional four suits: diamonds, clubs, hearts and spades. That's because computing is a science \emph{and} an art. It allows us to study human society and culture, so it's part of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities}{humanities} too (see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities}{digital humanities} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science}{computational social science} for example). Last but not least, computing is also an engineering discipline and a branch of mathematics too. What all this means is that the computational joker is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(cards)}{wild card} that can be played \emph{whenever and wherever} you like, making it an incredibly powerful but dangerous card, depending on the game you are playing (see chapter \ref{broadening}). ♣♥♠♦🃏

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/wikijoker}

\caption{If academic disciplines are playing card suits then Computer Science is the joker in the pack.

\end{figure}



The flexibility of computing as a career means you have a broad range of options on where you can apply your computational skills. You don't \emph{have} to be studying Computer Science to take advantage of these opportunities, but it helps.

It's all very well \emph{designing} your future but now you need to actually engineer it by \emph{testing} and \emph{building}. An obvious place to start is with your CV or résumé, because that's where most people get going. How can you create a bug-free CV, résumé or completed application form? How can you support applications with a strong personal statement or covering letter? These documents are a crucial part of your future so how can you debug them? 🕷

\item
  Structure and style the content of your CV and résumé appropriately
\item
  Articulate your story\footnote{actually a collection of short stories} as evidenced by your \texttt{experience}, \texttt{projects} and \texttt{education} etc
\item
  Identify and fix bugs in CV's by:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    Their \texttt{content} (what you've done and who you are) and \texttt{presentation} (how you style your CV)
  \item

\hypertarget{blackhole}{%
\section{Beware of the black hole}\label{blackhole}}

Before we get started, let's consider some advice from software engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell}{Gayle Laakmann McDowell}. Gayle is an experienced software engineer who has worked at some of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech}{biggest technology employers in the world}: Apple, Microsoft and Google. She has also authored a cracking series of books on technology careers, particularly \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_the_Coding_Interview}{Cracking the Coding Interview}} \citep{cracking} which we'll discuss in chapter \ref{speaking}. Gayle refers to the employer ``black hole'' described in figure \ref{fig:gayle-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/gayle-black-hole} 

}

\caption{Beware of what software engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell}{Gayle Laakmaan McDowell} calls the employer ``Black Hole'', especially if you're applying to large employers. ``Getting through the doors, unfortunately, seems insurmountable. Hoards of candidates submit résumés each year, with only a small fraction getting an interview. The online application system -- or, as it's more appropriately nicknamed, \emph{The Black Hole}, -- is littered with so many résumés that even a top candidate would struggle to stand out.'' \citep{blackhole, techcareer} Laakmann portrait by Gayle Laakmaan is licensed CC BY 4.0 via Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/wiu}{w.wiki/wiu} adapted using the \href{https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238}{Wikipedia app} Thank you Gayle for permission to use your photo.}\label{fig:gayle-fig}
\end{figure}



If you're applying to big employers, you'll need to create a CV that is good enough to stand out before it disappears over the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon}{event horizon} and into an employers black hole, see section \ref{rejection}. Employer practices vary, but according to some estimates the person reading your CV will typically:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Spend around \textbf{7 seconds} (or less!) deciding if it is interesting
\item
  Shortlist about \textbf{20\%} of the all CVs they get sent
\item
  Interview about \textbf{2\%} of the candidates on their shortlist
\end{itemize}

So, the FIRST thing your CV or résumé needs to do is, \emph{persuade an employer to invite you to an interview}. You can start with an employer-agnostic CV but you may need to come back and revisit the issues in this chapter once you have identified some target employers, so that you can customise and tailor your CV and written applications.

\hypertarget{dead}{%
\section{The CV is dead, long live the CV!}\label{dead}}

Résumés and CV's have reigned supreme in the kingdom of employment and recruitment for many years but their demise has often been predicted, see figure \ref{fig:longlive-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/the-king-is-dead} 

}

\caption{The seemingly contradictory phrase \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_king_is_dead,_long_live_the_king!}{the king is dead, long live the king} simultaneously announces the death of the previous monarch and the accession of a new one. Likewise, the death of the CV (and résumé) has long been hailed but it keeps coming back to reign again. The CV is dead, long live the CV! The résumé is dead, long live the résumé!

\end{figure}



While it is true that some employers don't accept CVs or favour online application forms or digital profiles, it is still worth writing a CV because:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Your CV provides a record for you of relevant things you've done
\item
  Your CV enables you to get your story straight, \emph{What's your story, coding glory?} see section \ref{story} \citep{whatsthestory}
\item
  Your CV forces you to articulate who you are and what you want, see chapter \ref{knowing}
\item
  Some employers will still ask you for one, see section \ref{robotproof} and figure \ref{fig:longlive-fig}
\item
  Your CV helps you script and practice your ``lines'' for interviews, see chapter \ref{speaking}
\end{itemize}

Even if an employer never asks you for your CV, you'll frequently want to use the \emph{content} of your CV in applications and interviews. So this chapter looks at how you can debug your written applications, whatever the mechanism is for submitting them.

You can of course \emph{augment} your CV with various public digital profiles such as LinkedIn, Github etc. A public digital profile can help employers find you, see section \ref{portfolio}.

\emph{Wherever} you're putting information about yourself for potential employers, on a CV, Résumé, LinkedIn profile the same principles apply. See the checklist in section \ref{checklist} and for specific advice on LinkedIn see:

\hypertarget{trope}{%
\section{It's not a bug, it's a feature!}\label{trope}}

An age old trope in Computer Science that engineers use to pass off their mistakes as deliberate features is the bug/feature distinction, see \ref{fig:notabug-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/notabug}

\end{figure}



Nobody likes buggy software, but unfortunately we routinely have to tolerate badly-designed, low quality, bug-ridden software in our everyday lives. \citep{badsoftware, failware}

In contrast, buggy CVs are rarely tolerated, they will usually end up in the bin. Even a tiny defect, like an innocent typo, can be \sout{fetal} fatal. Most employers (particularly large and well known ones) have to triage hundreds or even thousands of CV's for any given vacancy. This means the person reading your CV is as likely to be looking for reasons to \texttt{REJECT} your CV, than \texttt{ACCEPT} it, because that's a sensible strategy for shortlisting from a huge pool of candidates. A buggy CV, application and covering letter could ruin your chances of being invited to an interview, see chapter \ref{speaking}.

Like writing software, the challenging part of writing a CV isn't the \emph{creation} but in the \emph{debugging} and subsequent re-writing. Can you identify and fix the bugs before they are fatal?

⚠️ \textbf{Coding Caution} ⚠️

If you ask three people what they think of your CV, you will get three different and probably contradictory opinions. CV's are very subjective and very personal. The advice in this chapter is based on common sense, experience and ongoing conversations with employers. What makes a good CV will depend on the personal preferences and prejudices of your readers. So, this chapter just describes some general debugging guidelines, rather than rigid rules.

It is good practice to \emph{triangulate} responses from your readers. For example, if three different people point out the same bug in your CV you can be confident that it is a bug that needs fixing.

While referring to this guide, remember that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The main purpose of your CV is to get an interview, not a job. Your CV should catch attention and provide talking points for an interview
\item
  Your CV will be assessed in seconds, rather than minutes so brevity really is key
\item
  Bullet points with verbs first (see section \ref{verbsfirst}) will:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    allow your reader to quickly skim read your CV because \href{https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/how-people-read/}{employers don't read CVs} quickly \citep{scanning}
  \item
    highlight your key activities
  \item
    avoid long sections of flowery \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose}{prose} which the reader will very probably skip anyway. Instead, you can use your beautiful prose on your covering letters or personal statements, see section \ref{we3qs}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

You're not trying to tell your \emph{whole} life story from section \ref{story} but to distill the essentials into several short stories which can be summarised into a handful of bullets or sentences. It's a bit like the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurb}{blurb} or synopsis on the back of a novel, can you entice the reader into wanting to find out more (by inviting you to an interview)?

\hypertarget{mycv}{%
\section{Is it a bug or a feature?}\label{mycv}}

Wherever criticism of your CV comes from, don't take it personally - it is probably one of the first you have written. Think of your current CV as an alpha or beta version that you continuously test, release and redeploy. There are many chances to debug and improve your CV during your study but before potential employers read it. The aim of this chapter is to help you improve your CV, whatever stage you are at. Employers often grumble that Computer Science graduates lack written communication skills. Written applications and CV's are a common example of this.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{EDUCATION}: Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) degree classification clear? Have you mentioned things you are studying now, not just courses you have finished? See section \ref{mycved}
\item
  \textbf{STRUCTURE}: Is the structure sensible? Is it in reverse chronological order? Most important (usually recent) things first? Not too many sections or anything missing? See section \ref{mycvst}
\item
  \textbf{NUMBERS}: Have you \emph{quantified} the context, action, results and evidence of the short stories on your CV where possible? See (\texttt{C.A.R.E.}) in section \ref{care}

\item
  \textbf{STYLE}: Does it look good, with a decent layout with appropriate use of \href{https://latex4year1.netlify.app/}{LaTeX} or Word or whatever? \citep{latex4year1} Are there any spelling mistakes, typos and grammar? Don't just rely on a spellchecker, some typos can only be \sout{spitted} spotted by a human reader see section \ref{spelling}
\item
  \textbf{LENGTH}: Does it fit comfortably on (ideally) one page (for a Résumé) or two pages (for a CV)? See section \ref{length}

How you structure your CV will depend on who you are and what your story is. Recruiters at Google suggest you have four or five sections, that follow a header section. Before we look at those, lets look at some general points about CVs, watch the video shown in figure \ref{fig:lopez-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \href{https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYUy1yvjHxE}{\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/lopez-fig-1} }

}

\caption{Recruiters at Google, \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-ong/}{Jeremy Ong} and \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizilopez/}{Lizi Lopez} outline some tips and advice for creating your résumé. You can also watch the 8 minute video embedded in this figure at \href{https://youtu.be/BYUy1yvjHxE}{youtu.be/BYUy1yvjHxE}. \citep{youtube-google-recruiters}}\label{fig:lopez-fig}
\end{figure}



As Jonathan Black, director of the careers service at the University of Oxford has pointed out, \citep{topnotchcv} there are three key things you want to demonstrate in your CV:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  that you can take responsibility
\item
  that you achieve things
\item
  that you are good company (or at least a valued team member)
\end{enumerate}

How can you demonstrate each of these traits? Watch the short video in figure \ref{fig:black-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \href{https://www.youtube.com/embed/yjdvCHWVtE4}{\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/black-fig-1} }

}

\caption{\href{https://twitter.com/jonathanpblack}{Jonathan Black}, head of the careers service at the University of Oxford, explains how to create a top notch CV by replacing meaningless assertions with meaningful evidence. You can also watch the 11 minute video embedded in this figure at \href{https://youtu.be/yjdvCHWVtE4}{youtu.be/yjdvCHWVtE4}. \citep{topnotchcv}}\label{fig:black-fig}
\end{figure}



Quantifying and providing evidence for any claims you make will create a much more convincing CV. Numbers can transform meaningless assertions described in figure \ref{fig:black-fig} into meaningful evidence. So for example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Achieved excellent results}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\ldots is a bit vague, what were the results exactly, can you measure them somehow? Or at least describe them?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Worked in a team}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

So you worked in a team? \texttt{Worked} is vague. What was your role and contribution exactly? How long did the project last? How many people were on your team? What were the results of your actions? What's the story, coding glory? \citep{whatsthestory}

\hypertarget{mycvpd}{%
\subsection{Your header}\label{mycvpd}}

The first thing in your CV is the header, a simple section giving your name, email, phone number and any links shown in the CV in figure \ref{fig:turinghead-fig} for Alan Turing. That's it!

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/alan-turing-header} 

}

\caption{Keep the header of your CV simple like Alan's example here. Just your name, email, phone number and any relevant links (e.g.~\href{https://enwp.org/Alan_Turing}{enwp.org/Alan\_Turing} here) are all you really need. If you have a public digital profile, your header is a good place to put it, see section \ref{portfolio}. Any additional information risks wasting valuable space and distracting your reader. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_(Unix)}{Less is more}.}\label{fig:turinghead-fig}
\end{figure}



Your header doesn't need to include any more information than your name, email, phone and any links. This means your birth date, marital status, photo\footnote{different countries have different conventions when it comes to passport-style photos on a CV. In the UK what you look like should \emph{not} be a factor in an employers decision to interview you, so leave it out} and home address aren't relevant. You don't need to give multiple phone numbers or emails either, just one of each will do. If an employer wants to invite you to an interview, they'll get in touch by email, phone (or possibly LinkedIn, github etc) so other contact details such as your postal address are an irrelevant distraction at this point. After your header I suggest you have about five sections that cover some or all of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  🎓 \texttt{Education}: the formal stuff, see section \ref{mycved}
\item
  💰 \texttt{Experience}: paid work, see section \ref{mycvex}
\item
  💪 \texttt{Projects}: personal, school, social, side or University projects see section \ref{mycvpj}
\item
  🏆 \texttt{Leadership\ and\ awards}: see section \ref{prizes}
\item
  ❓ \texttt{Optional}: but don't call it that, see section \ref{misc}
\end{enumerate}

Let's look at each of these sections in turn:

\hypertarget{mycved}{%
\subsection{Your education}\label{mycved}}

Unless you have a \emph{significant} amount of experience, the \texttt{Education} section of your CV should be the first real section, after the header see figure \ref{fig:blair-fig}. Your education section needs to strike a balance between:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Describing in enough detail what you've studied and any projects you've completed at University as part of your formal education
\item
  Keeping it short and sweet by avoiding getting bogged down in tedious and irrelevant details will be of little interest to your readers
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/tony-blair-education-education-education} 

}

\caption{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair}{Tony Blair}'s top three priorities as a new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom were \texttt{education,\ education,\ education}. \citep{blair} Likewise, your education should be a top priority on your CV, it should go first, unless you've got a \emph{significant} amount of \texttt{experience}. As a graduate (or undergraduate) your education is the most recent and relevant thing about you so it should have top billing, see the discussion in figure \ref{fig:lopez-fig}. This \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License}{GNU Free Documentation Licensed} (GFDL) portrait of Tony Blair in 2007 by the Polish Presidency on Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/64Kd}{w.wiki/64Kd} has been adapted using the \href{https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238}{Wikipedia app}}\label{fig:blair-fig}
\end{figure}



You've invested a significant amount of time and money in getting your degree. At this stage, your degree justifies a longer description than a rather terse one line \texttt{BSc\ Computer\ Science}. You'll need to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  say \emph{more} than \href{Penelope_Tester.pdf}{Pen Tester} and \href{Rick_Urshion.pdf}{Rick Urshion}, who haven't said enough about their University education
\item
  say \emph{less} than \href{Mike_Rokernel.pdf}{Mike Rokernel}, who has given \emph{way} too much information on his degree.
\end{itemize}

You don't need to name every single module, course code with a mark for each. Neither do you need to give your result to FOUR or FIVE significant figures: \texttt{71.587\%}\footnote{Do you \emph{really} think academic performance can be measured that precisely?}. Two significant figures will do just fine: \texttt{72\%\ (first\ class)}. You might like to pick out relevant modules, or the ones you enjoyed most. Employers like Google encourage applicants to emphasise courses on data structures and algorithms, but you'll need to tailor your description to the role and be brief. On a one page CV, you might only have two or three lines to describe your higher education. 🎓

\hypertarget{mycvex}{%
\subsection{Your experience}\label{mycvex}}

Experience is where you can talk about any paid or voluntary work experience you have. For paid work call it \texttt{EXPERIENCE} rather than \texttt{WORK\ EXPERIENCE} as the latter can imply work \emph{shadowing}, see section \ref{areuexperienced}. Work shadowing is valuable, but paid work is even better so you should make it clear if your experience was paid or not. Don't discount the value of casual labour, such as working in retail or hospitality, these demonstrate your work ethic and ability to deal with customers, often under pressure. You are more than just a techie too, so anywhere you've worked in a team is experience worth mentioning, even if that team was just two people. Two people is still a team.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/What have you done} 

}

\caption{Are you experienced? What have you done outside of your formal academic education? Employers will want to know \emph{much more} about you than just your \texttt{Education}. Are you \texttt{Experienced}? What \texttt{Projects} have you done? Can you demonstrate \texttt{Leadership}? Have you won any \texttt{Awards}?

\end{figure}



If you don't have much experience, don't worry, there are plenty of opportunities to get some more . For details, see chapter \ref{experiencing} \emph{experiencing your future}.

Are you experienced? Whatever it is, make sure you add it to your \texttt{experience} section. 💰

\hypertarget{mycvpj}{%
\subsection{Your projects}\label{mycvpj}}

The \texttt{PROJECTS} section of your CV is where you can describe all other activities you get up to. These might include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  personal side projects, see section \ref{tinkering}
\item
  social responsibility projects, see section \ref{volunteering}
\item
  open source projects, see section \ref{opensource}
\item
  entrepreneurial projects, your ``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_job}{side hustles}''
\item
  hackathons, olympiads and other competitive or collaborative events, see section \ref{tinkering}
\item
  University projects

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    these sometimes fit better in your \texttt{Education} section
  \item
    Be \emph{careful} publishing coursework, this can make you liable for accusations of plagiarism. If someone copies your coursework, you will \textbf{both} be guilty of academic malpractice\ldots{}
  \item
    \ldots{} but final year (``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capstone_course}{capstone}'') projects are great as these will tend to be unique, distinguishing you from everybody else in your year group
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Your projects will most likely be unpaid because paid work tends to fit better under the heading \texttt{experience}, see section \ref{mycvex}. Perhaps you've completed some courses outside of your education such as a massive open online course (MOOC) or similar. Hackathons and competitions, fit well here too. \citep{hafb} You don't \emph{need} to have won any prizes or awards, although be sure to mention them if you have. Participating in hackathons and competitions clearly shows the reader that you enjoy learning new things. Demonstrating an appetite for new knowledge and skills will make your application stand out. If you're looking for some inspiration for side projects, the \href{https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x}{codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x} repository is a good starting point. Building and creating new things is a great way to understand them, just ask \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman}{Richard Feynman} shown in figure \ref{fig:feynman-fig}. What you cannot create you do not understand. Another great way to learn is to get involved with open source projects which we describe in section \ref{opensource}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/what-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand}

\end{figure}



Any longer projects you've done at University are worth mentioning. Your projects are important because they differentiate you from everyone else in your year group. Try to be \emph{more} descriptive than this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{First year team project}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or perhaps

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Second year team project}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or even just

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Final year project}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

By themselves, those project names are pretty opaque. They are OK for giving the context of your story but don't give the reader much else to go on. What was the story (the context, action, result and evidence (\texttt{CARE}) we described in section \ref{care}) of those projects? How many people were in your team? How long did you collaborate for? What did you build? What was it called? What did it do? What roles and responsibilities did you have in the team? Was their conflict in the team? How did you resolve it? How did you motivate the free-riders in the team to contribute? This is all excellent CV \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fodder}{fodder}, see \ref{fig:cvfodder-fig}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/CV Fodder} 

}

\caption{Have you ever had a project that didn't go very well? Did it all go \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pear-shaped}{pear-shaped}? Perhaps you managed to turn the project around? Maybe you learned some lessons from those painful mistakes you won't be repeating? Difficult projects can make great stories (aka CV \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fodder}{fodder}) because mistakes \emph{can} be good, see section \ref{estherdyson}, as long as you don't repeat them.

\end{figure}



It's often better to describe what YOU did before you describe what the software, hardware or project did. Your reader is much more likely to be interested in the former than the latter. Let's imagine you've developed a piece of software called \texttt{WidgetWasher}. You might describe it like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{WidgetWasher is a web service that washes widgets}
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{It uses an HTTP API and secret keys}
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Tested WidgetWasher on a range of different operating systems}
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Collaborated with one other contributor over two days}
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Designed and implemented an API}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Instead, you could reverse ↑↓ the order to change the emphasis like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Designed and implemented an API ↑}
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Collaborated with one other contributor over two days ↑}
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Tested WidgetWasher on a range of different operating systems}
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Utilised an HTTP API and secret keys ↓}
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Created a web service that washes widgets called WidgetWasher ↓}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The latter has all the same information, but by reversing the order, you've emphasised what \emph{you} did, rather than what the software did. Much more interesting. 💪

\hypertarget{prizes}{%
\subsection{Your leadership \& awards}\label{prizes}}

If you can demonstrate leadership, you may want to dedicate a whole separate section for it. If you have experience of tutoring or mentoring other students, perhaps younger or more junior ones, make sure you highlight it as leadership. Teaching is a different kind of leadership to running a small business or captaining a sports team, but it is leadership nonetheless.

A \texttt{leadership} section is also a good place to add any prizes you've won. If you've been granted any interesting awards or honours be sure to mention them, because they show the reader that a third party has endorsed you. \emph{Other} people think you are good at something, and this says much more than \emph{you} thinking you're good at something. You'll typically need a bit more than this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Awarded the Poppleton University scholarship for excellence}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Congratulations, but how many people were awarded that prize? How many applicants or entrants were there and what percentage were successful? Was it a regional, national or global award? How frequently is the award given? It is unlikely that your reader will have heard of the award unless it is widely known. You might talk about rank e.g.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Won third prize in the flibbertigibbet competition}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Again, congratulations, but third place out of how many:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{3/3}? Not so impressive
\item
  \texttt{3/30}?
\item
  \texttt{3/300}?
\item
  \texttt{3/3000}? More impressive
\end{itemize}

Numbers make a big difference so if you're going to mention awards, quantify\footnote{an approximation will do if you don't have exact figures} where you can so the reader can understand what the prize was for. You may well be intimately acquainted with the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flibbertigibbet}{flibbertigibbet} competition but your reader probably won't of heard of it, so give some context. 🏆

\hypertarget{misc}{%
\subsection{Your optional extras}\label{misc}}

If you have anything else you want to highlight besides your \texttt{Education}, \texttt{Experience}, \texttt{Projects} and \texttt{Leadership\ and\ Awards} you \emph{may} still have room for one more optional extras section. Try to come up with a better name than \texttt{Miscellaneous}, \texttt{Extracurricular} or \texttt{Other\ highlights\ and\ activities}, which sound like dumping grounds for the leftovers. You might decide to have a dedicated \texttt{skills} section but see section \ref{mycvsk}.

You may opt to have a \texttt{hobbies\ and\ interests} section which can add a bit of colour to what can otherwise become quite a dull list of facts. However, it is debatable how many (if any) hobbies and interests you should list on your CV. For a one-pager you're usually pushed for space and looking for things to edit \emph{out} (rather than add in), so if you're going to list hobbies, I'd stick to those that are relevant to the job or those that demonstrate particular transferrable or soft skills. Organising or participating in team sports is a good example of a relevant hobby as it provides evidence of your teamwork, commitment, reliability etc, see figure \ref{fig:quidditch-fig}. Other collaborative activities outside of sport will also demonstrate your communication skills. \citep{hobbies}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/Anyone for quidditch} 

}

\caption{It is debatable which, if any, of your hobbies should go on your CV. You might get lucky and your interviewer(s) will share your esoteric passion for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(real-life_sport)}{Quidditch} (say). \citep{quidditch} However, such coincidences are unlikely so if you \emph{do} list your hobbies and interests, think carefully about \emph{WHY} you are mentioning them and \emph{WHAT} skills or knowledge you are trying to demonstrate to potential employers. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyone_for_tennis\%3F}{Anyone for Quidditch} sketch by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:quidditch-fig}
\end{figure}



The fact that you enjoy \texttt{swimming}, \texttt{reading}, \texttt{football}, \texttt{cooking} and \texttt{hiking} is vague and pretty boring, making it unlikely to be a factor in the decision to invite you to interview. There's nothing \emph{wrong} with these pastimes but there's not much point mentioning them on your CV unless you have, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  coached a swimming team
\item
  trained as a mountain leader
\item
  organised, hosted and participated in a book club
\item
  won some awards for your hobby, like a black belt for example
\item
  regularly participated in or organised competitive sports matches (for example)
\end{itemize}

In this case, the \emph{way} you have engaged with your hobbies demonstrates your communication and leadership skills. So in this context, your hobbies \emph{are} worth talking about if you have any space left. However, if they are just hobbies that enable you to amuse yourself, you should probably leave them out as they are unlikely to be of interest to an employer. Sure, they add colour to your CV, but you've probably got more interesting and important things to say about who you are.

Of course, you \emph{might} get lucky and your interviewer(s) could be intrigued by (or even share) your esoteric passion for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(real-life_sport)}{Quidditch} (say), but you can't rely on it. So, I reckon if you're going to mention hobbies and interests at all then \ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  pick the unusual hobbies that make you unique
\item
  describe the interests that add some colour and personality to your CV
\item
  be specific, e.g.~\texttt{reading\ japanese\ novels\ from\ 20th\ century} might sound more interesting (and convincing) than just \texttt{reading}
\item
  highlight any \texttt{actions} you've taken, see chapter \ref{actioning}
\end{itemize}

\ldots{} or just leave them out altogether. That option is up to you.❓

\hypertarget{mycvsk}{%
\subsection{Your skills?}\label{mycvsk}}

You may be tempted to dedicate a whole section on your CV to \texttt{skills}, particularly the technical ones. Maybe it makes you feel good listing them all in one place like a stamp collection. If you're going to have a \texttt{skills} section, keep it short. Why? Let's imagine, that like \href{Rick_Urshion.pdf}{Rick Urshion}, you include Python in a long list of skills, with its own dedicated section. There are at least five problems with Rick's not so skilful approach:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  ❎ \textbf{No \texttt{Context}} to give the reader an idea of where he's developed or used his Python skills. Was it during his education, as a part of his work experience or his personal projects? We don't know because he doesn't say.\\
\item
  ❎ \textbf{No \texttt{Actions}} to demonstrate what he's \emph{done} with his Python skills. So Rick claims he knows Python. So what? What did he use them for? We don't know because he hasn't told us.
\item
  ❎ \textbf{No \texttt{Results}} given for what the outcome of using the skills was. Did he save his employers some money? Did he make something more efficient? Did he learn some methodology? We will never know.\\
\item
  ❎ \textbf{No \texttt{Evidence}} to support his claims. Perhaps he DOES have Python skills, perhaps he DOESN'T. Is he telling lies and peddling fake news (see section \ref{oversell})? It's difficult to tell.
\item
  ❎ \textbf{No \texttt{C.A.R.E.}} There's no story told for that skill, see figure \ref{fig:gallagher-fig}. This makes for a very dull and boring read. Yawn. NEXT! 🥱
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/whats-the-story} 

}

\caption{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(What\%27s_the_Story)_Morning_Glory\%3F}{(What's your Story) \sout{Morning} Coding Glory?} \citep{whatsthestory} What is the \texttt{Context}, the \texttt{Actions}, the \texttt{Results} and the \texttt{Evidence} for the stories that you are trying to tell? Show your \texttt{C.A.R.E.} in storytelling. CC BY portrait of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Gallagher}{Noel Gallagher} by \href{https://alterna2.com/}{alterna2.com} on Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/3bim}{w.wiki/3bimy} adapted using the \href{https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238}{Wikipedia app}}\label{fig:gallagher-fig}
\end{figure}



So, this doesn't mean Rick shouldn't mention his Python skills. Where he can, he needs to give us the \texttt{C}ontext, \texttt{A}ction, \texttt{R}esult and \texttt{E}vidence (\texttt{C.A.R.E.}) of his story described in section \ref{care}. This will make his Python story much more convincing and interesting to read. Showing a bit of \texttt{C.A.R.E.} will improve his chances of being invited to interview.

This applies to soft skills too, not just hard technical skills. It is often better to mention the context in which you've used the skills you mention on your CV. So, if you're going to have a skill section:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  keep it short (one or two lines maybe) but personally I'd avoid dedicating a whole section to it
\item
  stick to your strongest and most relevant skills that you are comfortable to answer questions on in your interview, rather than an exhaustive encyclopædic inventory
\item
  avoid listing mass marketed office products of Microsoft (e.g.~Word etc) as a skill, they are \emph{not} generally very interesting skill because almost \emph{everyone} has them. They won't set you apart much from your competition, so don't waste valuable space talking about office unless you've done something interesting with them, like some advanced integration with other software. Cloud services can be a slightly different matter, see section \ref{techie}.
\end{itemize}

If you're a computer scientist, you also have demonstrable \texttt{meta} skills like the ability to learn things quickly. You can also think logically and critically, reason, problem solve, analyse, generalise, decompose and abstract - often to tight deadlines. These \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking}{computational thinking} skills are future-proof and will last longer than whatever technology happens to be fashionable right now. Employers are often more interested in these \texttt{meta} capabilities and your potential than in any specific technical skills you may or may not have.

\hypertarget{birds-eye-view}{%
\section{Birds eye view}\label{birds-eye-view}}

Having looked at the sections you're likely to have, we'll take a birds eye view of your whole CV. The issues in this section apply to the whole of your CV, rather than individual sections.

Seemingly trivial typographical details can make a big difference to the overall look and feel of your document. The devil is in the detail, for example this text in a bulleted list doesn't use a proper indent\ldots{}

• \texttt{The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog.\ The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog.\ The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog.\ The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog.\ The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog.\ The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog.\ \ The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog}

\ldots{} whereas the text below does use a proper indent. The latter looks more professional and is easier to read, especially when you have multiple bullet points:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog.\ The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog.\ The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog.\ The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog.\ The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog.\ The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog.\ \ The\ quick\ brown\ fox\ jumps\ over\ the\ lazy\ dog}
\end{itemize}

Whatever your typographical style is, portable document format (\texttt{*.pdf}) is the safest way to deliver it. It's called portable for a reason. While Microsoft Word is fine for editing, it is difficult to ensure that a Word document doesn't get mangled by transmission via the web, email or even Microsoft's own products like Teams! PDF is much safer, you can be more confident that it will work well on a range of different operating systems and devices. Try opening a Word document on a range of different smartphones and tablets and you'll see what I mean. It helps your reader if you can give your CV file a descriptive name, especially if it is being read by a human and not a robot. 🤖

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ❌ \texttt{cv.pdf} (not a very descriptive filename)
\item
  ✅ \texttt{ada\_lovelace.pdf}(a descriptive filname)
\item
  ❌ \texttt{cv-version1-final-FINAL-version-USE-THIS-ONE.pdf} (reveals more about you than you might want to!)
\item
  ✅ \texttt{alan\_turing.pdf}(a descriptive filname)
\item
  ❌ \texttt{one-page-version.pdf} (unhelpful)
\end{itemize}

It's fine to author your CV in Microsoft Word, but you'll want to save it as (or print to) PDF to make it more platform independent. LaTeX and overleaf can be used to create professional PDFs and there are plenty of good templates. See \href{https://latex4year1.netlify.app/}{Getting started with LaTeX (LaTeX4year1)} if you've not used LaTeX before, or you need to refresh your memory. \citep{latex4year1}

\hypertarget{care}{%
\subsection{What's your story, coding glory?}\label{care}}

One way to structure descriptions of items within each section of your CV is to use \textbf{C}ontext, \textbf{A}ction, \textbf{R}esult and \textbf{E}vidence (C.A.R.E.) to tell your stories. What's your story, coding glory? \citep{whatsthestory} The \texttt{C.A.R.E.} method can also be useful for structuring answers to interview questions, especially if you get nervous. So for example, rather than just listing \texttt{Python} as a skill, you could tell the reader more about the context in which you've used python, what you actually did with it and what the result was. You really need to spell it out.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{CONTEXT}: So you've used \texttt{Python}, but in what context? As part of your education? For a personal project? As a volunteer? In a competition? All of the above?
\item
  \textbf{ACTION}: What did you \emph{do} with \texttt{Python}? Did you use some particular library? Did you integrate or model something? What verbs can you use to describe these actions, see chapter \ref{actioning}
\item
  \textbf{RESULT}: What was the result and how can you measure it? You picked up some new skills? What was the impact? Perhaps you made something that was inefficient and awkward into something better, cheaper or faster? Some things are hard to measure but you should quantify results where you can.
\item
  \textbf{EVIDENCE}: Where evidence exists, you should highlight it. That could be a quantification, for example describing a result in numbers (see \texttt{as\ measured\ by} below) or it might be certification described in chapter \ref{achieving}. If you're talking about software, point to a copy online if you can, see section \ref{portfolio}. Nothing says ``I can build software \ldots{}'' quite like `` \ldots{} and here's one I made earlier''.
\end{itemize}

You don't have to stick rigidly to the order C.A.R.E. as long as they appear somewhere. For example, recruiters at Google (see figure \ref{fig:lopez-fig}) advise candidates to describe their experience and projects using this simple pattern:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Accomplished }\CommentTok{[}\OtherTok{X}\CommentTok{]}\NormalTok{, as measured by }\CommentTok{[}\OtherTok{Y}\CommentTok{]}\NormalTok{, by doing }\CommentTok{[}\OtherTok{Z}\CommentTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Where \emph{accomplished} is \texttt{Result}, \emph{measured by} is \texttt{Evidence} and \emph{doing} is the \texttt{Action}. So instead of just saying:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Generated reports for end users}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You could say:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Generated daily reconciliation report for team by automating workflow of 8 different tasks}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The latter is better because it is more specific, captures the result (\texttt{accomplishment}), by giving evidence (\texttt{8\ different\ tasks}) and talks about the actions (the \texttt{doing} part). Choose the verbs you use carefully, see chapter \ref{actioning} for examples.

\hypertarget{length}{%
\subsection{Your length}\label{length}}

How long should your CV be? Many people start with a two page CV, which is a sensible starting point shown in figure \ref{fig:oneortwopager-fig}. It is also advisable to \href{https://www.cv-library.co.uk/career-advice/cv/how-long-cv-be/}{create a one page Résumé}. \citep{howlong}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \href{https://www.youtube.com/embed/0abDOKHS5T0}{\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/oneortwopager-fig-1} }

}

\caption{How long should your CV be? Should you write a two page European style CV or an American style résumé (one pager)? You can also watch the 5 minute video embedded in this figure at \href{https://youtu.be/0abDOKHS5T0}{youtu.be/0abDOKHS5T0}. \citep{youtube-resume-or-cv}}\label{fig:oneortwopager-fig}
\end{figure}



At this stage in your career you \emph{should} be able to fit everything on to one page. However, it can be challenging and time consuming squeezing it all on, see figure \ref{fig:shorterletter-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/shorterletter} 

}

\caption{I would have written a shorter \sout{letter}, \sout{CV}, Résumé but I did not have the time. This quote (or meme) is frequently attributed to Blaise Pascale's \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettres_provinciales}{Lettres provinciales}} \citep{shorterletter}.

\end{figure}



It takes more time to write less. Writing a one page résumé is a valuable exercise, because it forces you to distill and edit out any filler or fluff, which you sometimes find on two page undergraduate or graduate CVs. It is much better to have a strong one-page résumé than a weaker two-page CV that is padded out with filler to make up the space, as described in the video in figure \ref{fig:oneortwopager-fig}. Adding more features (pages and content) to your CV doesn't necessarily make it better. Sometimes adding more features to your CV will make it worse, as shown in figure \ref{fig:morefeatures-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/an-engineering-state-of-mind} 

}

\caption{If it ain't broke it doesn't have enough features yet. Adding more features to software doesn't necessarily make it better. Likewise, adding more pages and content to your CV or résumé won't always improve it. It's often better to be precise and concise, rather than bloated and potentially more buggy. \href{https://bryanmmathers.com/an-engineering-state-of-mind/}{An engineering state of mind} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}, with help from Dilbert cartoonist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams}{Scott Adams}}\label{fig:morefeatures-fig}
\end{figure}



If you're struggling to fit all the information onto a one page résumé, revisit each section and item carefully. Is there anything you can drop? Can you save a wasteful word here, or a lazy line there? Check for any spurious line breaks because every pixel counts. Don't throw your two page CV away, it is still a good store of stuff you might want to add to customised one-page résumés.

\hypertarget{verbsfirst}{%
\subsection{Verbs first: lead with your actions}\label{verbsfirst}}

A simple but effective technique for emphasising what you have done, rather than just what you know, is to start the description of it with a verb. Employers don't just want to know what you know, but what you have actually done. So, for example, instead of saying e.g.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{In my second year CS29328 software engineering module I used Java, Eclipse and JUnit to test and build an open source Massively Multiplayer Online Role{-}Playing Game (MMORPG)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

you could say:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Built and tested a large open{-}source codebase using Eclipse, Ant, JUnit and Jenkins”}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

followed by:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Added and deployed new features to a Massively Multiplayer Online Role{-}Playing Game (MMORPG) in Java}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The latter examples get to the point much quicker and avoid the problem of using \texttt{I,\ me,\ my...} too much which can sound self-centred and egotistical. Although your CV is all about you so it is natural to have a few personal pronouns in there, too many can look clumsy and give the wrong impression. Choose the verbs you use carefully, see chapter \ref{actioning} for examples.

\hypertarget{links}{%
\subsection{Your links}\label{links}}

Augmenting your CV with web links (hyperlinks) can add important context to your story, without adding too many words or taking up valuable space. An example using LinkedIn is shown in figure \ref{fig:lovelace-fig}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/lovelace-linkedin} 

}

\caption{Adding links is a good way to augment your CV. If you're adding LinkedIn, make sure you \href{https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/topics/6042/6054/87}{customise your public profile URL}, (the \texttt{.../in/handle}) to remove the default randomly generated alphanumeric string at the end, like the \texttt{038b37} example here. \citep{customlinkedin} You can also remove any ugly \texttt{http}, colons \texttt{::}, forward slashes \texttt{//}, \texttt{www} and trailing \texttt{/} in URLs which are distracting noise. Just make sure links are clickable in the pdf, don't \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404}{404} if they are followed and work when printed on paper too. Neither do you need to waste valuable space telling people what the link is, like in the first example, the domain name already tells you that it is a LinkedIn profile.}\label{fig:lovelace-fig}
\end{figure}



Links can provide \texttt{Context}, (Action), \texttt{Result} and \texttt{Evidence} (see \texttt{C.A.R.E.} in section \ref{care}) by quantifying and substantiating any claims that you make. Links demonstrate what you've done and which communities you've been a part of. For example, you might says things like:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Built a thing called example.com}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This shows that the thing you built was substantial enough to have its own domain. It also says ``I like building things. Look at this thing I built just for fun, its really cool''. Or you might say:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Elected as a representative for hacksoc.com}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The link shows you were part of a community: ``I was part a bigger thing\ldots{}'' you might not have heard about but you can find out about here. You might also say:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{Competed at hack{-}to{-}the{-}future.com part III}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Reading between the lines: ``I really enjoy learning from other people by going to hackathons and competitions''

\ldots{} and so on. So links are crucial features of your CV and an interested reader \emph{may} even follow them. Treat links with respect and they will support your goals and help your readers. Invest some time thinking about how you word the link text, and how they would be understood out of context. Make sure that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  your hyperlinks are \href{https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/links/}{readable and descriptive} \citep{readable}\\
\item
  your hyperlinks are clickable in the PDF. Don't expect your reader to cut and paste (or even type) URLs, they are too busy. If they are clickable, people are much more likely to follow them
\item
  your hyperlinks are paper-proof. Some people still print CVs so links with opaque titles like ``My LinkedIn'', \href{https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere.html}{click here}, and ``Projects on Github'' won't work well on printed paper unless you explicitly spell out the link. See \href{https://bbc.in/3zXv6zr}{to print or not to print --- a CV, that is} \citep{printcv}
\end{itemize}

Besides LinkedIn you could include public profiles from \href{https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile}{github.com}, \href{https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021734632-Update-your-profile-and-username}{devpost.com}, \href{https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard}{hackerrank.com} and \href{https://medium.com/@rhamedy/contribution-debt-why-how-to-contribute-to-stack-overflow-a69d4bd50d0c}{stackoverflow}, see section \ref{portfolio} \citep{stackoverflow}. You can also link to personal projects, any articles you've published or your blog if you have one. Obviously, you need to be careful about what you link to and what employers can find out about you online. They \emph{will} Google you. So keep it professional and, as we discussed in a section \ref{signposts3}, be wary of social media.

\textbf{\texttt{\#\ Coding\ Comment}}

LinkedIn is much more than a tool for publishing your CV or résumé because it also allows you to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  search and apply for jobs
\item
  create a digital portfolio that is publicly available\footnote{you might want to be careful about what information you put out there!}
\item
  connect with professionals, think social media for jobs
\end{itemize}

Chapter \ref{finding} looks at job searching in more detail but for now just note the similarities and differences between LinkedIn, CVs and résumés outlined in table \ref{tab:linkedintable}. Some of these differences also apply to other places online where you might augment your CV with extra information such as github, devpost and others mentioned in section \ref{links} and \ref{portfolio}.

So, LinkedIn can be a useful tool for job hunting but it's a different beast to traditional CV's, some of these differences are shown in table \ref{tab:linkedintable}

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:linkedintable}Comparison of LinkedIn with conventional CV's and résumés. The two mediums have a lot in common but also provide different communication channels which can be complementary, e.g. you include your LinkedIn profile on your CV to augment it.}

\begin{tabular}[t]{ll}
\toprule
LinkedIn & CV or résumé\\
\midrule
Dynamic document that you can constantly update & Static document, providing a snapshot that can't be updated once you've  sent it\\
Generally speaking, no length limit & Limited length, typically one or two pages (for a graduate), see section \ref{length}\\
Public or semi-public document, more like social media & Private document, should only be seen by those employers you send it to (anti-social media if you like)\\
Only one profile, you can't easily transfer connections if you open more than one account & You might create multiple CV's that emphasise different skills and knowledge, or have different lengths such as a one page résumé and two page CV\\
Generic, allows employers and recruiters to target you & Specific, can be targeted to a given employer or vacancy\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



\hypertarget{robotproof}{%
\subsection{Robot proofing your CV}\label{robotproof}}

It's a good idea get feedback from as many different sources as you can on your CV. By \emph{sources} I don't just mean humans, but also robots. Larger employers will use automated \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system}{Application Tracking Systems} (ATS) to log and trace your application. These ``résumé robots'' (if you like) are unlikely to have arms and legs like the one in figure \ref{fig:machines-fig}, but they \emph{will} be looking for keywords and standard headings in your CV. \citep{airesume} You can get automated feedback from a range of different automated systems, though it is a good idea to remove any personal information like phone numbers and emails before using these free services. You might also want to check what the services privacy policy says about what they do with your personal data. Résumé robots include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://careerset.io}{careerset.io}, a free service provided by a UK based company, careerset Ltd.~If you're a manchester student login at \href{https://careerset.io/manchester}{careerset.io/manchester}
\item
  \href{https://www.jobscan.co}{jobscan.co}, a free service provided by an American company not really a CV checker
\item
  \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=resume+checker}{google.com/search?q=resume+checker}
\item
  \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=cv+checker}{google.com/search?q=CV+checker}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/The-inevitable-rise-of-the-machines-1280x720} 

}

\caption{Just like the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek}{daleks} in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who}{Doctor Who}, résumé robots often struggle to get up the stairs. Although they typically don't have arms, legs (or even wheels) robots are likely to play an important role in decisions made about if you are worth interviewing, especially if you're applying to bigger companies. Make sure your CV is résumé robot friendly by getting feedback from a robot. \href{https://bryanmmathers.com/machines/}{Machines} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:machines-fig}
\end{figure}



Besides providing feedback on the content of your CV, using these systems can help address issues such as the use of tables or layout which may cause problems for some systems. For example, some systems ignore the second column of a two-column CV because they can't parse the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript}{PostScript} reliably to identify columns. Some things to check with automated CV screens:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Have you used standard headings for the sections? Non-standard sections maybe ignored or misunderstood
\item
  Have you used appropriate verbs to describe your actions?
\item
  Is your layout and design robot friendly? Sometimes tables and two column layouts can get horribly mangled, see \href{https://www.jobscan.co/blog/resume-tables-columns-ats/}{what happens to tables and columns in an applicant tracking system} \citep{jobscan}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{spelling}{%
\subsection{Spellchecking}\label{spelling}}

Bots, grammar and spell checkers will improve your CV but you can't rely on automated help completely. The résumé robots described in section \ref{robotproof} will just encode the biases and prejudices of whoever wrote their algorithms. Spellcheckers can't be relied on completely either, as shown in the poem below:

\begin{verbatim}

Eye halve a spelling checker
It came with my pea sea
It plainly marques four my revue
Miss steaks eye kin knot sea

Eye strike a key and type a word
And weight for it to say
Weather eye am wrong oar write
It shows me strait a weigh

As soon as a mist ache is maid
It nose bee fore two long
And eye can put the error rite
Its rare lea ever wrong

Eye have run this poem threw it
I am shore your pleased two no
Its letter perfect awl the weigh
My chequer told me sew

---Anon
\end{verbatim}

While automation can help improve your writing, ultimately there is no substitute for people (you know: actual \emph{humans}) reading your CV, and the more people that read it the better. This could be potential employers, your critical friends shown in figure \ref{fig:wonderfuldarling-fig} or just reading it \textbf{out loud} to yourself described in section \ref{dogfooding}.

\hypertarget{referees}{%
\subsection{Your references}\label{referees}}

You might be tempted to put your referees details on your résumé. Don't bother because;

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  references waste valuable space. You can say much more interesting things about yourself than who you referees are
\item
  references aren't needed in the early stages of a job application anyway. Employers typically ask for your referees \emph{much} later, when you've been offered or are about to be offered the job
\item
  references disclose personal information. Do you really want to be giving personal details out to anyone that reads your CV? It could easily be misused.
\end{itemize}

It's not even worth saying \texttt{references\ available\ on\ request} - that just wastes space as well and is implied information on every CV anyway.

\hypertarget{bp7}{%
\section{Breakpoints}\label{bp7}}

Let's pause here. Insert a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint}{breakpoint} in your \texttt{code} and slowly step through it so we can examine the current values of your variables and parameters.

\hypertarget{checklist}{%
\section{Checklist: Big Bad Bugs}\label{checklist}}

Here is a quick check-list for debugging your CV before you send it off to an employer:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  ✅ Does it fit comfortably on exactly one page (résumé) or two pages (CV)? Definitely not one-and-a-half pages or more than two? See section \ref{length} Does the style look good? Is it easy on the eye? Is there adequate whitespace, not too much (gappy) or too little (cramped)? See section \ref{pdf}
\item
  ✅ Have you used past tense consistently e.g.~\texttt{developed} not \texttt{develop}, \texttt{collaborated} not \texttt{collaborate}
\item
  ✅ Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) overall degree classification clear? See section \ref{mycved}
\item
  ✅ Have you eaten your own dogfood (woof), see section \ref{dogfooding}? Is \emph{everything} relevant? e.g.~no swimming certificates from ten years ago?
\item
  ✅ Have you spell-checked using both automatic and manual (proof-reading) techniques? See section \ref{spelling}.
\item
  ✅ Have you got a second opinion from a ``résumé robot''? Is it robot proof? See section \ref{robotproof} 🤖
\item
  ✅ Have you shown you \texttt{C.A.R.E}? Are the \texttt{Contexts}, \texttt{Actions}, \texttt{Results} and \texttt{Evidence} described in section \ref{mycvsk} clear? Have you added \texttt{context} using relevant hyperlinks that an interested reader can click on? See section \ref{links}
\item
  ✅ Is it in reverse chronological order with the most recent things \textbf{first}? Can your timeline be easily followed, with all dates clearly aligned for easy reading? See \href{https://www.cdyf.me/Neil_Pointer.pdf}{Neil Pointer} as an example with a clear timeline using right-aligned dates.
\item
  ✅ Have you avoided using too many personal pronouns? \texttt{I,\ me,\ my\ ...} everywhere? See section \ref{verbsfirst}
\item
  ✅ Have you made it clear what you have actually done using \textbf{prominent} \texttt{verbs}? See chapter \ref{actioning}
\item
  ✅ Have you given sufficient information on your education without going into too much detail? Have you mentioned courses you are studying now (\emph{and} next semester)? See section \ref{mycved}
\item
  ✅ Have you \textbf{quantified} and evidenced the claims you have made where you can? See section \ref{mycvst}
\item
  ✅ Is it balanced, including both technical and non-technical (softer) skills? See section \ref{casual}
\item
  ✅ Does it have a good, clear structure? Not too many headings, around five sections for a one-pager see section \ref{mycvpd}?
\item
  ✅ Have you clearly distinguished between paid, unpaid and voluntary \texttt{experience}? Have you done the same for your \texttt{projects}, see section \ref{mycvpj}? Have you included \emph{all} of the relevant experience that you can fit on including casual work, see section \ref{casual}?
\item
  ✅ Has your CV been reviewed by other people? Do a CV swap with a critical friend (see figure \ref{fig:wonderfuldarling-fig}) and score each others CV's using \href{https://www.cdyf.me/CV-rubric.pdf}{this rubric}. This is a bit like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming}{pair programming}. According to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus\%27s_law}{Linus's law} ``given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow'' \citep{Raymond1999} so the more people who give you feedback the better
\item
  ✅ Have you reviewed other people's CV's? This will put you in the shoes of an employer or recruiter, thereby helping you to write a better CV yourself. See the examples in chapter \ref{hacking}. Who would \emph{you} want to interview and why?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Covering letters \& personal statements}\label{we3qs}}

Applications and CV's are often accompanied by covering letters or include some kind of personal statement. They are your \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch}{elevator pitch} shown in figure \ref{fig:elevator-fig}. Whereas a lot of your CV is essentially a bulleted list of facts, numbers and evidence, a covering letter or personal statement gives you a chance to \emph{really} demonstrate your fluent written communication skills in clear \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose}{prose}. If you're going to include a \texttt{personal\ statement} or \texttt{profile} on your CV keep it short, unlike \href{https://www.cdyf.me/mike_rokernel.pdf}{Mike Rokernel} who waffles on for ages without providing any evidence. This kind of information usually fits better in your covering letter anyway, because there isn't much space for it on a CV.

Let's say you're applying for a widget engineering position at the world famous gadget company \texttt{widget.com}. There are three things you need to convey in the following order:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Why them?} Why are you applying to \texttt{widget.com}
\item
  \textbf{Why that role?} Employees of \texttt{widget.com} have many roles and responsibilities but what is it about \texttt{widget\ engineering} (say) that attracts you?
\item
  \textbf{Why you?} Why should \texttt{widget.com} employ you? What skills and experience make you stand out from all the other candidate widget engineers? What are your Unique Selling Points (USPs)? Say why \emph{you} would be good for \emph{them} (\textbf{not} why widget.com would be good for you and your career).
\end{enumerate}

You can see some examples of answers to these questions at:

\hypertarget{elevatorpitch}{%
\subsection{Does anyone actually READ covering letters?}\label{elevatorpitch}}

Some employers will read your covering letter very carefully, others less so. It is not always clear which employers will bother and which won't.

Even if \emph{nobody} reads your covering letter, it is still worth writing one because formulating answers to the three basic questions in section \ref{we3qs} will force you to rehearse standard interview questions.

Think of your covering letter as practicing some of the lines of your elevator pitch shown in figure \ref{fig:elevator-fig}.

\section{Debugging summary}\label{tldr7}}

Too long, didn't read (\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn\%27t_read}{TL;DR})? Here's a summary:

In this chapter we have looked at how to debug your future, with a particular focus on your CV (or résumé). If you fix the bugs we've described here, before an employer sees your CV, you'll stand a much better chance of getting an interview. The checklist above in section \ref{checklist} is a good place to start.

\emph{Some} of the strategies you apply to debugging your \emph{actual} code, can also be applied to debugging your future:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Inspect, don't squash bugs, take time to reflect (see section \ref{reflecting}) and \emph{understand} any bugs you find in your future
\item
  Being stuck is temporary, see section \ref{nevergiveup}
\item
  Check your assumptions, especially if debugging the \texttt{content} bugs described in section \ref{ilo7} makes you anxious or depressed, see chapter \ref{nurturing}
\item
  Don't go it alone, grow your network, see section \ref{weakties}
\item
  Build your debugging toolkit by identifying your strengths and weaknesses, see chapter \ref{knowing}
\end{itemize}

Debugging your future can be an enjoyable adventure! Debugging your future is Coding your future.

In the next part (chapter \ref{finding}) we'll look at using your CV and other written applications to help you \emph{find} your future.

\hypertarget{experiencing}{%
\chapter{Experiencing your future}\label{experiencing}}

So, tell me, are you experienced? Why is experience valuable and what kind of experience are employers looking for anyway? How can you get some more experience? 🤔

\begin{figure}

\caption{Do you respond with a sheepish \texttt{experience\ not\ found} when people ask about your experience? Is your experience like the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404}{classic page not found} error message \texttt{HTTP\ 404}? The client sent you a valid request for your experience, but your server couldn't find it. Awkward. Embarrassing silence? 😳 Don't worry, there are some simple and easy ways to build your experience so that instead of negative 404's, you can respond with a cheerfully positive \texttt{200\ (OK)}, as described in this \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes}{list of HTTP status codes}.

\hypertarget{why-is-experience-so-valuable}{%
\section{Why is experience so valuable?}\label{why-is-experience-so-valuable}}

You are \emph{much more} than your grades, because your education is only a part of who you are. You are the sum total of your experiences, this is one of the reasons that experience is so valuable, see figure \ref{fig:experience-fig}. It's common for students to be focused on their grades, whether those grades are low, middling or or high. At the extremes, if you have got lower grades than you'd like, you might be anxious or unhappy about them. If you've got higher grades, you're probably focussed on keeping them high. While its important to focus on getting the best grades you can, employers are interested in the whole you rather than narrowly focusing on your academic education. Alongside your academic achievements, there is also your:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  💰 \texttt{Experience} paid work, see section \ref{mycvex}
\item
  💪 \texttt{Projects} of all kinds, see section \ref{mycvpj}
\item
  🏆 \texttt{Leadership\ and\ awards} if you have or can demonstrate any \ref{prizes}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/experience} 

}

\caption{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience}{Experience} is one of the best ways to develop \emph{know-how}. While your formal education and academic study can help you develop \emph{know-what}, you need to complement this knowledge with a range of experiences and on-the-job learning. This astronaut is training to work in microgravity by completing tasks underwater in a space suit. Like the astronaut, your education needs to combine academic study, with practical experience on-the-job.

\end{figure}



Your experience tells a story about who you are, what you're capable of and what you have learned. Experience is a crucial part of \emph{how} you learn and allows you to demonstrate \emph{what} you have learned. Experience makes you more \emph{employable} which means:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  experience tests and validates what you have already learned, see Sneha's story in chapter \ref{sneha}
\item
  experience motivates you to learn more by helping you decide what to learn next
\item
  experience improves your confidence \citep{jackiecarter}
\item
  experience broadens and deepens your skills and knowledge, see figure \ref{fig:goal-fig}
\item
  experience improves your chances of being invited to interview
\item
  experience improves your chances of being offered a job after an interview
\item
  experience builds your professional network of contacts, particuarly the crucial weaker ties described in section \ref{weakties}
\end{enumerate}

Paul Redmond at the University of Liverpool describes experience as a key part of employability \citep{paulredmond} as expressed in his graduate jobs formula shown in equation \eqref{eq:redmond}.

\begin{equation}
  E = Q + WE + S \times C
  \label{eq:redmond}
\end{equation}

According to Redmond, your employability (\(E\)) is the sum of your qualifications (\(Q\)), your work experience (\(WE\)) and your strategies (\(S\)) multiplied by your contacts (\(C\)). It is difficult to quantify employability so precisely but Redmond's equation \eqref{eq:redmond} is a good starting point for discussion. We will look at some strategies

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For qualifcations (\(Q\)), see section \ref{mycved} on your \texttt{Education}
\item
  For strategies (\(S\)) and contacts (\(C\)) see chapter \ref{finding} on \emph{Finding your Future}
\item
  For experience (\(WE\)) read on, this chapter is all about your \texttt{experience}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{areuexperienced}{%
\section{Are you experienced?}\label{areuexperienced}}

So what counts as \texttt{experience}? I'm going to use experience to mean applying what you've learnt in your formal education outside of school or University, this includes but its not limited to, paid work. Employers use terms to describe jobs and experience for undergraduates and graduates inconsistently. So I've defined and outlined terms for relevant kinds of experience shown in table \ref{tab:jobterms} and we'll use these definitions throughout the book.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:jobterms}Are you experienced? Terms used throughout this guidebook to describe experience, employment and their definitions}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{ll}
\toprule
Experience & Description\\
\midrule
Casual & Part-time or casual work, for example in hospitality or retail etc\\
Voluntary & Unpaid, both in technical and non-technical roles for charity or nonprofit organisation\\
Social & Unpaid, participating in a club or society e.g. students union, sport etc\\
Entrepreneurial & Self-employment, freelancing, contracting, “moonlighting” in a [side job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side\_job) or starting as a [sole-trader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole\_proprietorship) or small business\\
Insight & Usually no contract of employment. One to three weeks, sometimes known as work experience, [work shadowing](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/jobs-and-work-experience/work-experience-and-internships/work-shadowing), spring weeks, vacation schemes or even [externships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externship). Sometimes unpaid, but often expensed. See [ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights](https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights) for some examples\\
\addlinespace
Internship & Fixed term contract of employment, typically 3 months full-time over summer, but anywhere between 1 and 6 months. Sometimes part-time, *may* be an assessed part of an undergraduate or postgraduate degree. Usually prior to graduation, but some employers offer *graduate internships*, which should really be called fixed-term graduate jobs (or schemes)\\
Placement & Fixed term contract of employment, typically 12 months long and an assessed part of a degree. In Europe they are sometimes known as a “sandwich” or “industrial experience” years because they typically take place in the *penultimate* (last but one) year of a degree. In America, placements are usually [known as co-ops](https://career.vt.edu/experience/ceip/ceip-internship-coop.html)\\
Graduate job & Full-time permanent contract typically working in one department of an organisation\\
Graduate scheme & Full-time permanent contract. Fast-track or high-flier managerial scheme, in your first two years, you'll probably rotate around different departments in an organisation\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\hypertarget{other}{%
\subsection{Other experience}\label{other}}

Some of the experience outlined in table \ref{tab:jobterms} was probably what you were already thinking of as experience, however there are three important sources of experience that students often overlook:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Voluntary work}: Any kind of work where you've given your time and labour to a community. That could be non-technical (working for a charity) or technical, such as contributing to open-source software, see section \ref{opensource} and figure \ref{fig:volunthero-fig}
\item
  \textbf{Casual work}: Working in hospitality or retail (etc) is often overlooked by students as an important source of relevant experience. It doesn't have to be technical to be relevant to employers, see section \ref{casual}
\item
  \textbf{Tinkering}: having side projects as a playground to help you learn new skills and knowledge, either solo or collaboratively see section \ref{tinkering}. For more competitive employers, side projects are likely to be more important. To get into ultra-competitive industries like gaming, candidates are often expected to have a portfolio of one or two games developed outside of University
\item
  \textbf{Student societies} Your students' union will have hundreds of official societies you can get involved in, and they'll be plenty of unofficial fringe communities too. As well as helping you develop new or existing interests, these societies give you an opportunity to serve a particular community of interest. Many societies seek members to take on positions of responsibility, above and beyond merely participating in their events. They provide fantastic opportunities to build new skills in a safe and supportive environment.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/volunthero} 

}

\caption{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering}{Volunteering} is a great source of experience that employers value. That could mean volunteering for charitable causes, taking responsibility in a student society or getting involved in open source projects.

\end{figure}



Before we discuss these experiences, lets look at some of the more conventional places for getting experience:

\hypertarget{bignames}{%
\subsection{Big name experience}\label{bignames}}

It's probably easier than you might think to get a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech}{big tech} or big employer name on your CV. For example, many large employers run \href{https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/insights}{insight days, vacation schemes and spring weeks}. These are often aimed at first year undergraduates, and are sometimes less competitive to get into than a longer term commitment such as a summer internship, year-long placement or even graduate job. A big name on your CV early in your degree can help it stand out later, as fluff bucket the grinning \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Cat}{cheshire cat} demonstrates on their CV shown in figure \ref{fig:bigname-fig}. 😻

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}



Other ways to get a big name on your CV include joining a big name competition or event, for example:

\item
  Facebook has hackathons, see \href{https://en-gb.facebook.com/hackathon}{facebook.com/hackathon} and \href{https://developers.facebook.com/}{developers.facebook.com}
\item
  Google hosts several events including:

\item
  Besides these kinds of dedicated events organised by big names, there are many competitions which are sponsored by them, see section \ref{tinkering}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/gsoc} 

}

\caption{Large well known organisations like Google have a range of schemes and competitions that allow you to get their name on your CV, without working for them directly as an employee.

\end{figure}



Big names can look good on your CV, but they are not the only way to make your CV stand out.

\hypertarget{smallnames}{%
\subsection{Small name experience}\label{smallnames}}

Any experience will help your CV stand out. Smaller employers have the advantage that they tend to be less picky than big names so it is often easier to get a foot in the door. It might not be what you see yourself doing for long, but the experience gained in a small company can be invaluable. You might even prefer working in a small company to a big corporation or conglomeration.

\hypertarget{opensource}{%
\subsection{Open source experience}\label{opensource}}

Open source software projects are a great way to get some solid experience of software engineering, see for example \href{https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/7/253459-why-computing-students-should-contribute-to-open-source-software-projects/fulltext}{Why Computing Students Should Contribute to Open Source Software Projects}. \citep{sigman18} There's two ways to get started:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Raise a new issue via the project's issue tracker, such as \href{https://guides.github.com/features/issues/}{github issues} \citep{githubissues}
\item
  \href{https://dev.to/rose/fixing-a-bug-on-my-open-source-project-from-start-to-finish-1749}{Fix a bug} by picking existing issues. \citep{fixabug} It might sound trivial, but fixing a bug demonstrates that you can collaborate with others, understand the architecture and toolchain being used (which might be complex) and solve problems. See \href{https://firstcontributions.github.io/}{firstcontributions.github.io} and the \texttt{\textless{}good\ first\ issue\textgreater{}} tag which helps new contributors identify starting points, see \href{https://goodfirstissue.dev/}{goodfirstissue.dev} for some aggregated examples.
\end{enumerate}

There are lots of different motivations for getting involved in open source, shown in figure \ref{fig:opensource-fig}. Whatever your motivation, contributing to open source software is fun, you'll learn heaps and it will look \emph{great} on your CV. Open source software is widely used by, so contributing is a great way to get some real world experience of software development. Many open source projects are funded by employers both large and small, and you can get paid to develop open source software through projects like Google's Summer of Code. \citep{gsoc}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/OS-contribution-motivations-1200x675} 

}

\caption{There are lots of good reasons for getting involved in open source software, gaining skills and experience of real software engineering in the wild is just one of them. \href{https://bryanmmathers.com/open-source-motivations}{Open Source Motivations} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:opensource-fig}
\end{figure}



If you're looking for a project to get stuck into, here are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diomidis_Spinellis}{Diomidis Spinellis} tips for getting started \citep{sigman18}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Choose a project with several active contributors, so that there is a community to help you
\item
  Choose a relatively popular project (with some GitHub stars) so that you can avoid \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware}{abandonware} but\ldots{}
\item
  \ldots{} Avoid ``blockbuster'' projects like \href{https://github.com/tensorflow}{tensorflow} or \href{https://github.com/microsoft/vscode}{vscode} , so that your contributions will not get lost in the politics and bureaucracy of a large project
\item
  Verify that you can build and run the project from your own setup
\item
  Ensure the project regularly accepts pull requests from outsiders, so that your contributions will have a chance of being accepted
\item
  Contribute a trivial fix to start with to test your ability use the project's workflows
\end{enumerate}

The guidelines for prospective contributors to Google's Summer of Code (GSoC) at \href{https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/}{google.github.io/gsocguides/student} go into more depth about how you can get involved in open source software development. Many of these general guidelines apply both inside (paid) and outside (unpaid) of GSoC. \citep{gsoc}

\hypertarget{volunteering}{%
\subsection{Voluntary experience}\label{volunteering}}

Experience as a section of your CV usually means \emph{paid} work. However, experience in the context of this chapter means anything where you can show you've been part of a bigger team, taken responsibility for something or tried to make the world a better place somehow. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Volunteering: Doing voluntary work is a good way to pick up new skills
\item
  Being involved in societies: e.g.~taking responsibility for things in a society
\item
  Getting involved in a community, either physical or online
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{tinkering}{%
\subsection{Hacking \& tinkering experience}\label{tinkering}}

Another good source of experience is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker}{tinkering} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture}{hacking}. Hackers and tinkerers improve or repair things in their spare time for fun, either as a solo project or collaboratively. For example, why not build an experimental:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Home media centre?
\item
  DIY smart energy meter?
\item
  Plant watering system for when you go on holiday?
\item
  See also \href{https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x}{github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x} for inspiration
\end{itemize}

Yes, these projects are amateurish, but tinkering and hacking will clearly demonstrate your passion for learning and engineering. Apart from being fun, weekend hacks can look \emph{great} in the \texttt{projects} section of your CV, see section \ref{mycvpj}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/hackathon} 

}

\caption{Hackathons are collaborative social events where you can learn how to rapidly prototype ideas in a friendly and supportive environment.

\end{figure}



Attending \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon}{Hackathons} is another way to learn and gain \texttt{experience} by tinkering, in a collaborative and social environment, see figure \ref{fig:hackathon-fig}. The word hackathon is a portmanteau of hacking (from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture}{hacker culture} not \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker}{security hacking}) and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon}{marathon}. Hackathons tend to be short (24 to 48 hours) but intense, see for example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://www.hackathons.org.uk/}{hackathons.org.uk}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \href{https://greatunihack.com/}{greatunihack.com}
  \item
    \href{https://www.studenthack.com/}{studenthack.com}
  \end{itemize}

\item
  \href{https://www.hackerearth.com/}{hackerearth.com}
\item
  \href{https://hackzurich.com/}{hackzurich.com}
\end{itemize}

Alongside these competitions, there are other hackathon-type events which are organised by a single employer, see section \ref{bignames}. There are also opportunities to build your technical experience by practicing coding interviews online such as hackerrank and leetcode, described in section \ref{codinginterview}.

Side projects like these help to distinguish you from your peers, but they don't \emph{have} to be technical, see section \ref{casual} and \ref{volunteering}. You might feel that you are too busy to do any side projects, but if working hard on academic study and getting top grades means that you:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Neglect hobbies, interests and friends
\item
  Start to suffer from anxiety or depression
\item
  Only have \texttt{projects} that were a compulsory part of your formal education
\end{itemize}

It might be time to reflect and consider re-balancing your priorities if you can.

\hypertarget{casual}{%
\subsection{Casual experience}\label{casual}}

You may already have experience of paid employment as a casual or part-time worker. This could include jobs such as waiting tables, serving in a bar or working in other areas of hospitality or retail, for example as a Saturday job.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/Titanic-paperboy-crop} 

}

\caption{Casual and part-time work tell an important story about you on your CV. For example, from the age of 12, I was a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy}{paperboy}, delivering newspapers directly to the doors of paying customers. This demonstrates reliability and work ethic, because I did this in all weathers (sun, wind, rain, snow, hangovers etc) for six years. If you have casual experience like this, don't forget to include it in your CV. Public domain image of the Titanic paperboy, Ned Parfett selling newspapers in London via Wikimedia Commons at \href{https://w.wiki/35HA}{w.wiki/35HA} adapted using the \href{https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia/id324715238}{Wikipedia app}.}\label{fig:paperboy-fig}
\end{figure}



It is important to recognise that these jobs have value. Many students make the mistake of overlooking their casual work experience because they discount it as non-technical and ``low-skilled''. In section \ref{mycvst} we saw that one of the stories you want to tell in your job applications is that you:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  take responsibility
\item
  achieve things
\item
  are nice to have around
\end{enumerate}

Doing casual work can demonstrate all of these things. For example, from the ages of 12 to 18 I was a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy}{paperboy}, except unlike the Titanic paperboy selling newspapers in the street in figure \ref{fig:paperboy-fig}, I delivered newspapers directly to the doors of paying customers every morning. This was not a particularly highly skilled job, but it \emph{does} demonstrate:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_ethic}{work ethic}: getting up early \emph{every} morning (including Saturdays). Sometimes work is about just turning up everyday!
\item
  taking responsibility and being reliable
\item
  understanding the value of money by earning a wage
\end{enumerate}

I've often spoken to students who neglect to tell me about their paid work in retail or hospitality. ``But it's not technical'' they say, ``it's low skilled and irrelevant''. However, serving customers demonstrates your ability to provide good customer service and work as part of a team, often under pressure, see figure \ref{fig:budgens-fig}. This is good evidence of the ``nice to have around'' bit that Jonathan Black refers to \citep{topnotchcv} and is something your formal education will not typically provide much evidence of. So, don't fall into the trap of discounting the value of casual or part-time labour.

\begin{figure}

Think carefully about the verbs you can use to describe casual experience, see chapter \ref{actioning}.}\label{fig:budgens-fig}

At the end of this chapter you will be able to:

\tightlist
\item
  Formulate job search strategies:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    by role, sector, skills, time, size, quantity, values, culture, network, salary and location
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Apply your search strategies to advertised (and unadvertised) opportunities

  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{strategies}{%
\section{Job search strategies}\label{strategies}}

Before we look at where to look for jobs, we need to discuss what to look for. Let's imagine there is a handy AI-powered function in python called \texttt{find\_jobs()} which knows \emph{everything} about:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  all the jobs available, regardless of where they are advertised, including hidden ones
\item
  all of your skills, knowledge, values and ambitions
\item
  every employer in the world, their services, products and values
\item
  everyone in your social and professional networks, right from first degree connections through to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation}{sixth degree connections} \citep{bacon}
\end{itemize}

Such a function doesn't really exist yet, but let's pretend that it does to illustrate some points about job searching. If you were to run the function with no arguments\ldots{}

see \url{https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/6f3a98ca6ae2cdcb611f8b4838fe25df}

\ldots you will be completely overwhelmed with the results. It can be bewildering knowing where to start your job search, because the possibilities are endless. Your \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_space}{search space} is huge.

Thankfully, we can break it down, but there are many parameters and variables in your search that you need to think about. Here are some basic strategies to help you start to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)}{decompose} the complex problem of job hunting into smaller, more manageable problems you can start to tackle. We've already mentioned some:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  👨‍🔬 by role, see section \ref{by-role}
\item
  📊 by sector, see section \ref{by-sector}
\item
  💪 by skills, see section \ref{by-skills}
\item
  🌍 by location, see section \ref{by-location}
\item
  👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 by network, see section \ref{weakties}
\item
  💰 by salary, see section \ref{by-salary}
\item
  🏋️ by size, see section \ref{by-size}
\item
  ❤️ by values, see section \ref{by-values}
\item
  🕰 by timing, see section \ref{by-time}
\item
  ⚖️ by quantity, see section \ref{by-quantity}
\end{enumerate}

Each strategy has is own strengths and weaknesses, so you'll probably want to combine more than one and experiment with different strategies as your search progresses over time. No doubt, you'll have some extra strategies of your own, this is not meant to be an exhaustive list, just a starting point:

\hypertarget{by-role}{%
\subsection{By role}\label{by-role}}

There are many different roles that studying computing gives you access to besides software engineering. So one strategy is to research the roles described in section \ref{otheroles}, focus on some you like the sound of and then apply for that kind of role. Let's say you are interested in \texttt{software\ engineering}. This is a strategy that will help you narrow down a huge number of jobs into something more manageable. For example:

see \url{https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/c13ddb4dbd5c43220cd35caa5d1f40c7}

The list of roles in section \ref{otheroles} will give you a flavour of some roles to think about, beyond software engineering.

\hypertarget{by-sector}{%
\subsection{By sector}\label{by-sector}}

Computing is found in every sector of business and society. This means won't just find computing jobs in the technology sector, whatever that is. Although the lines between some sectors are becoming increasingly blurred, you can still narrow down the options by picking a sector you are interested in and pursuing that. For example:

see \url{https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/ecc64065d98a45b54ed178f370af6abf}

Like many graduate employment guides, the Guardian 300 guide (see section \ref{studentjobs}) has good overview of different sectors by breaking down employers by sectors such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consulting
\item
  Public sector
\item
  Finance
\end{itemize}

Picking a sector can help you get started, by narrowing what might otherwise be a massive search space. The sector(s) you choose will also determine the kind of salary you can expect, see section \ref{by-salary}. \citep{letsmakelotsofmoney}

\hypertarget{by-skills}{%
\subsection{By skills}\label{by-skills}}

Is there a specific skill you have that you enjoy using, or a technology you know that has a bright future? You could use this as a way to find jobs, for example:

see \url{https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/61bf8c20b4eb2da9a168ebb29b7026fd}

Picking a specific technology can sometimes help you narrow down the options, for example by using these keywords in your search.

\hypertarget{by-location}{%
\subsection{By location}\label{by-location}}

Pick a location. London? Manchester? Paris? Geneva? New York? \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley}{Silly Valley}? Depending on the location, this will determine the options that are available:

see \url{https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/5004cbf5fc337fb8e7357e62c50d15eb}
\ldots{} and so on. So locations can help you define (and potentially reduce) your problem space. For example, if you're looking in Manchester, you can get started at \href{https://git.io/manc}{git.io/manc}. Picking a location can also help you identify networking opportunities for hidden, un-advertised vacancies and making speculative applications. You could find out about employers by attending free \href{https://www.meetup.com/}{meetup.com} or \href{https://www.eventbrite.com/}{eventbrite.com} events in your chosen location.

\hypertarget{weakties}{%
\subsection{By network}\label{weakties}}

The people in your network can help you find work. \emph{\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it\%27s_not_what_you_know_but_who_you_know}{It's not what you know, its who you know}}, or so the cliché goes. \citep{newfads} The bigger your network, the more opportunities you'll know about. So a really basic strategy for finding jobs is using your networks. Remember, \texttt{find\_jobs} does just know what you know, it also knows who is in your professional \texttt{network} and the employers \emph{they} know about, so we could ask it to find opportunities in your professional and social networks:

see \url{https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/c2e05b55e55c285de8525a6952731f30}

Your close network probably won't change that much, the friends and family you trust and rely on. Its important to recognise the importance of more casual acquaintances, or what sociologist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter}{Mark Granovetter} calls ``weak ties''. \citep{granovetter}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/Bumped into} 

}

\caption{It's not what you know, its who you know: Networking and personal contacts can be more useful than just knowledge and skills alone, when seeking employment. Networking is an essential part of any job search, your networks can help you now and in the future. One of the things looked at in this chapter is how to build and use your networks to help find the job you're after. The simplest networking technique is bumping into people, but you need create opportunities for that to happen.

\end{figure}



Weak ties are people you don't know as well, but are important for a range of reasons. Research has shown that \href{https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-why-your-weak-tie-friendships-may-mean-more-than-you-think}{building networks of weak ties is good for your mental health and can give you an edge in job hunting}. \citep{weakties} Granovetter showed that many job opportunities came through weak ties, rather than strong ones. This is true not just of jobs early on in your career (like now) but also later too. So it is in your interests to continually foster weak connections and be open to serendipitous meetings where you bump into people, as in Figure \ref{fig:bumped-fig}. ``Bumping into'' here, could mean either physical or virtual.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/grow your networks}

\end{figure}



\hypertarget{by-salary}{%
\subsection{By salary}\label{by-salary}}

You can also define your search space by salary:

see \url{https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/28c308ee12c067b95dd724eabfc9e291}

Setting a minimum salary will include or exclude certain employers from your search. To do this realistically, you need to know how much you are worth, see section \ref{undersell} and figure \ref{fig:salaries-fig} for some places to start.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/salaries-fig-1} 

}

\caption{Average graduate starting salaries (in £) at the UK's ``top'' employers 2007 to 2022, according to \href{https://www.highfliers.co.uk}{highfliers.co.uk} \citep{highfliers2022} Since 2007, graduate salaries have risen from \texttt{£24,500} to \texttt{£32,000k} in 2022. Note that these are \emph{graduate} salaries, not internship or placement salaries which tend to be lower. Also note that ``top'' employers is a highly subjective judgement, lots of good smaller employers don't feature in this data and they typically pay less than the large multinational organisations dominating this sample. The averages also hide significant variations by sector and location, see the salary resources in section \ref{undersell}}\label{fig:salaries-fig}
\end{figure}



\hypertarget{by-size}{%
\subsection{By size}\label{by-size}}

Do you see yourself working for a large multi-national corporation or a bedroom startup? Or something in-between? There's advantages and disadvantages to each, but like all our other parameters, picking an organisation size can help you get started. In some cases, size will also define the \texttt{type} or organisation, for example:

see \url{https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/5ec7d37a60637c7083dc661e74ddcaf9}

Likewise, if you know you want to work for a multi-national, that gives you a list of employers you can target. Picking a size, can help you identify employers you would like to work for. Table \ref{tab:shortcuts} summarises some of the when and where some employers typically advertise.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:shortcuts}The practicalities of applying for vacancies, internships, placements, graduate jobs and schemes in large multinational employers and small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs)}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lll}
\toprule
 & Large employers & SMEs\\
\midrule
Where & Advertise broadly & Less likely to advertise on big jobs boards\\
When & Vacancies open earlier in the academic year & Vacancies *tend* to open later in the academic year\\
How & Typically multistage applications, several rounds of interviews & Typically shorter application and interview processes\\
Who & Typically receive high volume of applications per vacancy & Typically receive lower volume of applications per vacancy\\
Process & Unlikely to consider speculative applications & May consider speculative or informal applications\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\hypertarget{by-values}{%
\subsection{By values}\label{by-values}}

Besides the necessary value of making a profit or balancing the books, which is all employers need to do to survive, what are the values of the employers you are interested in? How do they match your own, the \texttt{values\_match} below? Reasonably or not at all? How much of your soul do you need to sell? All of it, or just some of it? This a difficult question to compute, see section \ref{soul}, but let's imagine we can:

see \url{https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/015a1182225f13c9307538468620ceb9}

An employers \texttt{values} are often reflected in the organisations \texttt{culture}. What is the employers culture like? What sort of structure would you fit into, see figure \ref{fig:pyramid-fig}? Would you enjoy working there and would you felt like you belonged? How can you actually find this out? Do you need to sell your soul? If you're struggling with these questions, you may need to do some more soul searching, see section \ref{soul} and chapter \ref{knowing}. Talk to employees too, this is why networking is important, see section \ref{weakties}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/Manu_Cornet_pyramid} 

}

\caption{Culture and values are often reflected in an employers structure. Finding out about an employers structure will help you begin to understand their \texttt{culture} and \texttt{values}, see section \ref{soul}.

\end{figure}



Our \texttt{find\_jobs()} function is useful, if only as a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment}{thought experiment}, but there's still the strategic questions of \emph{when} you use the function and \emph{how often} so lets look at those next.

\hypertarget{by-time}{%
\subsection{By timing}\label{by-time}}

For graduates and undergraduates, the time of year you are looking can determine what jobs you can look for. At the beginning of the academic year in September you might target large multinational organisations. If you're not successful, you could switch to smaller employers later in the academic year. For example ``It's October, so I'm applying to large employers'' or:

see \url{https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/83030d66f53da3d664f6cd3ed7746a36}

Armed with knowledge of \emph{when} to apply you can start to target employers. Timing is important because in some cases it will sometimes determine the \texttt{type} of organisation you apply to.

\hypertarget{by-quantity}{%
\subsection{By quantity}\label{by-quantity}}

Should you optimise the \emph{quantity} of your applications or the \emph{quality}, see figure \ref{fig:blunderbuss-fig}?

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Blunderbuss} 

}

\caption{As you target employers, what will your strategy be? At one extreme you could optimise the \emph{quantity} of your applications, aiming to do as many as you can. This is shown in the left of the picture by the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunderbuss}{blunderbuss} (or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun}{scattergun}) strategy. You make lots of applications but don't target or tailor them much in the hope that \emph{some} will hit the target if you point your weapon (CV) in approximately the right general direction. At the other extreme you could optimise the \emph{quality} of your applications by spending more time researching the employer and carefully aiming your shots more like a sniper would (in the right of the figure). Which strategy is best? Blunderbuss sketch by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:blunderbuss-fig}
\end{figure}



Figure \ref{fig:blunderbuss-fig} shows two extreme approaches to job hunting, in reality you'll probably want to strike a balance between \emph{quality} and \emph{quantity}. Finding jobs by quantity can set a pace and rhythm to your job search:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{“I will do one application per week during term time”}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or set a time limit for what you're prepared to do:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialStringTok{* }\NormalTok{“I\textquotesingle{}ll spend two hours per week finding and applying for jobs”}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you find yourself:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Making a small number of applications, you may need to consider applying more widely and spending \emph{less time} on each application
\item
  Making a large number of applications, you may need to consider applying less and spending \emph{more time} on each application
\end{itemize}

This raises the question, how big is a \emph{small} or a \emph{large} number of job applications, which isn't easy to answer. Doing fifty applications over a couple of months may mean the quality of each application is too low.

\hypertarget{looking}{%
\section{Where can you for look for jobs?}\label{looking}}

Using our fictional \texttt{find\_jobs} function we've described and discussed some basic strategies to get you started. Sadly no such function exists yet, so armed with a rough idea of what you're looking for, where can you actually look?

The marketplace for job searching and job hunting advice is incredibly crowded. Employers spend huge amounts of money on recruitment and this is reflected in the enormous range of job websites, which are often accompanied by advice on job hunting. There are four kinds of places you can look for jobs:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  🎓 Undergraduate and graduate jobs boards, such as Gradcracker and your University \ref{studentjobs}
\item
  👀 General jobs boards, such as Google jobs (and the rest) see section \ref{generaljobs}
\item
  🎨 Portfolio style, such as LinkedIn and Github which allow you to publish a public profile, see section \ref{portfolio}
\item
  👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 Your network, online and offline, see section \ref{weakties}
\item
  🕵️ Recruiters, get a recruiter to help you, see section \ref{recruiters}
\end{enumerate}

Google job search shown in figure \ref{fig:googlejobs-fig} is a good starting point. It doesn't index \emph{every} job listings site, see \href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44853472}{Google's job hunting service comes to UK} \citep{noindeed}, but its a pretty good place to start.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Google job search indexes jobs advertised by many of the resources mentioned in this chapter. You can use google job search use to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven't used it already try the searches below. Unlike other sites, Google job search works by indexing embedded \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)}{microdata} structured using \href{https://schema.org/JobPosting}{schema.org/JobPosting}. Keywords like \texttt{job} and \texttt{intern} in an ordinary (vanilla) google search will trigger the job search product, as shown in the following examples:

  -\href{https://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester}{google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester}

  -\href{https://www.google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern}{google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern}

  -\href{https://www.google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer}{google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer}

  -\href{https://www.google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london}{google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london}

  -\href{https://www.google.com/search?q=data+scientist+intern}{google.com/search?q=data+scientist+intern}

  -\href{https://www.google.com/search?q=research+software+engineer+job}{google.com/search?q=research+software+engineer+job}

  -Google job search is an impressive product, see \href{https://grow.google/job-seekers}{grow.google/job-seekers} but it doesn't index \emph{everything}. If you're looking for a job AT google, they have moved from \href{https://jobs.google.com/about/}{jobs.google.com} to \href{https://careers.google.com/}{careers.google.com}, see also section \ref{bignames}
\item
  \href{http://www.glassdoor.co.uk/}{glassdoor.co.uk} is like tripadvisor for jobs. Find out what it's \emph{really} like to work for given employers from current and former employees. A student oriented version can be found at \href{https://www.glassdoor.com/Students}{glassdoor.com/Students}, this means you can use it without writing a review of a previous employer (which is what non-student users have to do to access the content)
\item

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{portfolio}{%
\subsection{Pushing a public profile}\label{portfolio}}

Jobs boards use the \textbf{pull} approach to job hunting, you search for and pull vacancies of interest. Alongside this, you can also try a \textbf{push} approach by publishing a professional public profile online.

Publishing a portfolio of your work online will allow employers and recruiters to come and find you, as well as you searching for them. Employers shouldn't expect you to have an online portfolio and you might not want to have one, but it can help. If you choose to have a public profile, you should link to it in the header of your CV, see section \ref{mycvpd}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{LinkedIn.com} is a social media service which allows you to put professional details online a bit like a semi-public or public CV, see figure \ref{fig:linkedin-fig} and table \ref{tab:linkedintable}. Besides allow you to advertise yourself, LinkedIn also:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    advertises job vacancies \href{https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/}{linkedin.com/jobs}
  \item
    is \href{https://blog.linkedin.com/2016/10/06/now-you-can-privately-signal-to-recruiters-youre-open-to-new-job}{frequently visited by recruiters}
  \item
    allows you to \href{https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/75815/applying-for-jobs-on-linkedin?lang=en}{apply for jobs directly through LinkedIn}
  \item
    (although \href{https://medium.com/otta-blog/job-boards-making-fast-applications-is-not-a-good-thing-5a4970887ecd}{making fast applications is not always a good thing})
  \item
    provides tutorials for students to get started \href{https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students}{linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-for-students}

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn}{Linkedin} is a social media service which allows you to build a professional public profile and for employers to advertise their job vacancies. Social media caveats aside (see section \ref{signposts3}), LinkedIn can be useful tool for networking with other professionals and finding a job, see table \ref{tab:linkedintable}. You can see Polly's profile at \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/pollymorphism/}{linkedin.com/in/pollymorphism/}}\label{fig:linkedin-fig}
\end{figure}



\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Github.com} allows you to publish code in public repositories that everyone can see, see figure \ref{fig:github-fig}. If you're comfortable doing it, publishing your software online can be a good way of demonstrating your technical skills and knowledge but be careful publishing your coursework online, see section \ref{mycvpj}. Nothing says ``\emph{I can build software}'' quite like ``\emph{here's one I made earlier}''. \citep{bluepeter}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/amish-github} 

}

\caption{Github is commonly used to host open source software development projects. As of June 2022, GitHub reported having over 83 million developers and more than 200 million repositories, including at least 28 million public repositories. The screenshot shows a profile of Computer Science student Amish Shah: \href{https://github.com/amishshah}{github.com/amishshah}}\label{fig:github-fig}
\end{figure}



\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Stackoverflow.com} You've probably already cut-and-pasted solutions from the question and answer forum Stack Overflow. You can also create a profile on Stack Overflow too, see figure \ref{fig:overflow-fig}. As of March 2021 the site had over 14 million registered users, and had received over 21 million questions and 31 million answers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/pezoverflow}

\end{figure}



So, if you're happy to publish your work online, sites like LinkedIn, Github and Stackoverflow can help you find jobs using a \emph{push} approach alongside more conventional \emph{pull} approaches described in section \ref{studentjobs} and \ref{generaljobs}. They can also be used to augument your CV, with the stuff that doesn't fit onto one or two printed pages. Digital profiles can be also be useful if you're looking for freelance, contract or part-time work.

\hypertarget{recruiters}{%
\subsection{What about recruiters?}\label{recruiters}}

Recruiters can help you find work and they operate in every industry sector. They are sometimes called ``head-hunters'', and there are two basic kinds that can help you:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Recruiters employed directly by an employer, for example in the human resources (HR) department of a given organisation.
\item
  Recruiters who are self-employed or work for a recruitment agency. They typically earn money from the number of interview candidates and successful hires they provide for their clients. They are often deliberately coy about who their clients are.
\end{enumerate}

Recruiters are usually not technical people, so don't expect them to any knowledge of software engineering (for example) - that isn't usually their skill set. Although recruiters can help you, it is worth being wary of recruiters as shown in figure \ref{fig:recruiter-fig}, especially if they work for an agency rather than being directly employed by the organisation you are interested in.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/recruiters-are} 

}

\caption{The autocomplete algorithm of a well known search engine gives you an idea of what \emph{some} people think about \emph{some} recruiters. This doesn't mean you should avoid recruiters completely, just be careful how you use them and pay attention to who they work for.}\label{fig:recruiter-fig}
\end{figure}



Some recruiters are very good and can help you. For example, there are some recruitment agencies that specialise in helping employers recruit graduates, these may be useful to you. However some recruiters are not very good, and don't provide a valued service for employers or potential employees like you. This is why you sometimes see \texttt{no\ recruiters} or \texttt{no\ agencies} on job adverts. So be wary of recruiters, and remember that some recruiters work primarily for their clients (employers) not you.

In most cases you shouldn't have to pay recruiters up front but job scammers will sometimes pose as recruiters so beware. Talking of job scammers, there's some things you need to be wary of when you are job hunting:

\hypertarget{beware}{%
\section{Buyer beware}\label{beware}}

When you're looking for job you're acting as both a buyer \emph{and} a seller.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{SELLING}: You're selling your services in a marketplace, for the best price you can get
\item
  \textbf{BUYING}: You're buying into the culture and values of an employer (see section \ref{soul}), who are trying to sell themselves to you.
\end{enumerate}

As a buyer and seller, you should be wary of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  🤥 Job scammers: section \ref{scams}
\item
  🤣 Over-specified jobs: section \ref{overspec}
\item
  😭 Unpaid internships: section \ref{unpaid}
\item
  📈 Overselling: section \ref{oversell}
\item
  📉 Underselling: section \ref{undersell}
\item
  🤔 Compromises: section \ref{compromises}
\item
  ⏰ Time sink: section \ref{timesink}
\item
  🤮 Rejection: section \ref{rejection}
\item
  🎢 The rollercoaster: section \ref{rollercoaster}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{scams}{%
\subsection{Beware of the job scammers}\label{scams}}

Most job adverts are legitimate but you are vulnerable when you are job hunting. You may become more vulnerable over time if you are getting repeated rejections (remember: repeated rejection is quite normal). Unfortunately there are some shady characters out there looking to exploit your vulnerability through various kinds of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_fraud}{employment fraud}. \citep{jobscammers} You should be wary of anyone asking you for:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Money up front - be very suspicious
\item
  Excessive personal data such your birth date, passport number and bank details. These could be used for identity theft, fraud or other criminal activities
\item
  Suspicious contact details and generic non-work free email addresses, e.g.~gmail, outlook.com etc \citep{jobscammers2}
\item
  See more examples in figure \ref{fig:jobscams-fig} and at \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=job+scams}{google.com/search?q=job+scams}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/Job-Scams-Signs-GOVUK} 

}

\caption{Beware of the job scammers. You should be highly suspicious of illegitimate companies, poorly-written job adverts, dodgy contact details and emails, unrealistic salaries, job offers without an interview and being asked for money up front. Spotting the signs of job scammers by gov.uk is licensed under \href{https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/}{Open Government Licence v3.0} \citep{jobscammers2}}\label{fig:jobscams-fig}
\end{figure}



Reputable employers (and jobs boards) will not try to scam you, but you should beware of job scammers if you find yourself looking for employment off the beaten track. Like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocchio}{Pinocchio}, its quite easy to spot lies once you recognise some of their nosey signals. 🤥

\hypertarget{overspec}{%
\subsection{Beware of over-specified jobs}\label{overspec}}

Employers and recruiters routinely over-specify job descriptions. A good example of this is, when the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)}{Swift programming language} was first publicly released in 2014 at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference}{Apple Worldwide Developers Conference} (WWDC) in California, job adverts instantly appeared asking for programmers with \texttt{5\ years\ experience\ in\ Swift}! How can \emph{anyone} have five years experience in a programming language that's only just been made public?! Aside from the people who developed the language, like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner}{Chris Lattner}, the recruiters and employers must have had a \emph{long} search trying to find their candidate. It must have taken them at least five years!

The moral of this Apple story above is, if you don't meet \emph{all} the criteria in a job specification, that shouldn't stop you applying. Most job specifications are over-specified as wishful employers dream up their ideal candidate.\footnote{Using a relationship analogy, describe your ideal romantic partner. PAUSE. How many people are actually likely to have ALL of those attributes?} Many employers will overstate their requirements in the hope they get their dream candidate. You might look at the job description and think, \emph{I've only got 70\% of what they're asking for, so I won't bother applying}. The reality is, if you've got 60\% of what they are asking for, you should probably apply. It's unlikely that \emph{anyone} will meet 100\% of the job requirements.

If you see things on job adverts you don't understand or are not sure about, go and find out about them. There's a good chance it will be similar to something you already know about, or you can self-educate yourself to fill any gaps. But beware of employers over-specifying jobs. 🤣

\hypertarget{unpaid}{%
\subsection{Beware of unpaid internships}\label{unpaid}}

In the UK, it is illegal to employ people without paying them a salary. However, there are exceptions which can allow employers to take on unpaid interns depending on how they classify their employment status. See for example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Employment rights and pay for interns \href{https://www.gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns}{gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns}
\item
  Targetjobs position on \href{https://targetjobs.co.uk/internships/advice/275017-the-law-on-unpaid-internships-know-your-rights}{the law on unpaid internships: know your rights}
\item
  This article on \href{https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/blog/why-i-regret-doing-an-unpaid-internship/}{Why I Regret Doing an Unpaid Internship} \citep{louiseregret}
\item
  For more horror stories see \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships}{google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships}
\end{itemize}

In science, technology and engineering, unpaid internships are much less common than in other sectors as demand for skilled scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics}{STEM}) is generally high. Some employers, particularly startups, may offer company \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)}{equity} (such as shares) as an alternative to a salary - again you should be wary of this. Unless you're very lucky, the chances are those shares will probably be worthless. Although many startups aspire to become \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)}{Unicorns}, very few do. Like many people, I don't endorse unpaid internships, and I recommend you avoid them completely, see section \ref{by-salary}. An unpaid internship might \emph{claim} to be giving you:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  some ``experience'' or ``exposure''
\item
  equity-for-work
\item
  something impressive for your CV
\item
  opportunities to ``build up your portfolio''
\item
  improved access to paid employment at some vague point the future
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, in the worst case, taking an unpaid internship leaves you vulnerable to exploitation by ruthless employers looking for cheap or free labour. 😭

There is \emph{one} exception to this: expenses paid work-shadowing for a short period of time (two or three weeks) such as spring insights described in section \ref{areuexperienced}. Otherwise, if you can't find paid employment, doing voluntary work is a much safer bet and has mental health and social benefits too, see section \ref{areuexperienced}.

\hypertarget{oversell}{%
\subsection{Beware of overselling}\label{oversell}}

When people try to sell you something, you will naturally be wary of overselling and fake news, see figure \ref{fig:fakenews-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/overselling} 

}

\caption{Beware of false or misleading information in the jobs marketplace. Pool tables and free snacks are nice but are what is it \emph{actually} like to work for a given employer? Are employers \emph{really} as good as they say they are? Are \emph{you} as good as you say you are? Or is it \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news}{fake news}?

\end{figure}



There's two kinds of fake news that are common in the jobs marketplace:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Employers overselling themselves}: Recruitment can be a bit of a beauty contest, with employers trying to show you their best side. Some employers may make promises they can't deliver but a quick look on sites like \href{https://www.glassdoor.com}{glassdoor.com} will help you evaluate employers. Even better, talk directly with actual employees of the organisation, both current and former. Is their employer really as good as they say they are?
\item
  \textbf{Candidates exaggerating their achievements}: It can be tempting to oversell yourself in the marketplace. An experienced reader or interviewer will be able to spot your fake news and find you out, see chapter \ref{debugging} \emph{debugging your future}
\end{enumerate}

So beware of fake news and overselling. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don\%27t_Believe_the_Hype}{Don't believe the hype}. \citep{dontbelievethehype} 📈

\hypertarget{undersell}{%
\subsection{Beware of underselling}\label{undersell}}

Likewise, you should make sure you don't undersell yourself. Know your value (financial), know your values (see chapter are \ref{knowing}) and try to understand how that fits with a given employer. What are the employers stated values? On the financial side, it is easy to find out about salaries, for example see:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://www.levels.fyi/}{levels.fyi} (``\emph{Get Paid, Not Played!}'') will give you a good idea of salaries
\item
  \href{https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/}{glassdoor.co.uk} has salary information alongside employee reviews of their employers
\item
  \href{https://github.com/IgWod/interns-salaries-uk-2018}{technical intern salaries in the UK} \citep{igwod}
\item
  \href{https://luminate.prospects.ac.uk/graduate-salaries-in-the-uk}{graduate salaries in the UK} \citep{michaelgrove}
\item
  \href{https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/blog/highest-paid-internships-placements-uk/}{The Highest Paid Internships and Placements in the UK} \citep{louiseintern}
\end{itemize}

Salaries in the UK for interns (and graduates) range from \href{https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage}{minimum wage} to £50k and over, with everything in between. So beware of under-selling yourself, know your value, see \ref{by-salary}. Some employers see students as a form of cheap labour that can be exploited because you're not ``qualified'' until you graduate. I'd think twice before working for such an employer, computing skills are in demand and there are plenty of other employers who will treat you with more respect. 📉

Knowing your value is crucial if you're going to negotiate any job offers you receive, see section \ref{offer}.

\hypertarget{compromises}{%
\subsection{Beware of compromises}\label{compromises}}

Engineering usually involves compromises and trade-offs, see figure \ref{fig:furber-fig}. You will have to make some compromises in \emph{engineering your future}. This might be in the design and implementation of your career, such as your salary, location, employer, values or something else.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/steve-furber} 

}

\caption{The design of a general-purpose processor, in common with most engineering endeavours, requires careful consideration of many trade-offs and compromises. \citep{furberarm} That's also true for your engineering your future too, what compromises and trade-offs are you happy to make?

\end{figure}



To work out what compromises and trade-offs you are prepared to make, you may need to revisit the issues discussed in chapter \ref{knowing}. 🤔

\hypertarget{timesink}{%
\subsection{Beware of the time sink}\label{timesink}}

Finding employers that you are interested in and submitting high quality job applications takes lots of time. Many students under estimate the time needed to job hunt. It can be a very time consuming process for everyone, both employers and candidates alike, see figure \ref{fig:timesink-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/timesink} 

}

\caption{Playing the game of job hunting can be a big drain on your time and some time wasting is unfortunately inevitable. Employers will waste some of your valuable time and you'll probably waste some of theirs too. Beware of the recruitment \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_sink}{time sink}.

\end{figure}



Even after you have managed to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify and articulate your skills and knowledge, see chapter \ref{knowing}
\item
  Understand what you're interested in, see chapter \ref{knowing}
\item
  Update your CV, see chapter \ref{debugging}
\item
  Consider all your options, see chapter \ref{broadening}
\item
  Target employers or sectors of interest
\end{enumerate}

.. the actual business of applying described in this chapter can be very bureaucratic. Any interviews you have will take time to prepare for (see chapter \ref{speaking}) and you've got loads of other calls on your time like studying and having a social life.

One way to tackle this problem is to schedule some time every week when you work on applications, see chapter \ref{scheduling}. However, there's no getting away from the fact that finding a job can consume a significant amount of your time. So beware of the time sink. ⏰

\hypertarget{rejection}{%
\subsection{Beware of rejection}\label{rejection}}

For most people, rejection is a normal part of applying for jobs. Rejection can take a heavy toll on your mental health described in chapter \ref{nurturing} and it is often a struggle. Some employers won't even bother to reply to reject you. Welcome to the employer \textbf{black hole} described in section \ref{blackhole} and shown in figure \ref{fig:blackhole-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/Black-hole-CV} 

}

\caption{Rejection is a normal part of applying for jobs, some of your applications may disappear without trace into employers ``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole}{black holes}'' we discussed in section \ref{blackhole}. This is likely to happen with larger employers who may have a strong gravitational force on job applicants like you. This \emph{doesn't} mean you shouldn't bother applying, but that you need to think about how to make your application stand out and avoid taking it personally if/when you don't hear back. CV black hole sketch by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}, based on an original image of the supermassive black hole in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87}{Messier 87} created using the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIRP_(algorithm)}{CHIRP algorithm} by the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Horizon_Telescope}{Event Horizon Telescope} team via Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/3RCa}{w.wiki/3RCa}}\label{fig:blackhole-fig}
\end{figure}



If you're getting too many rejections or all your applications are sucked into black holes, it might be because you need to :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  debug your CV and job applications some more (see chapter \ref{debugging})
\item
  develop a better job search strategy (see this chapter, chapter \ref{finding})
\item
  broaden your job search (see chapter \ref{broadening})
\item
  pay attention to your mental health, rejections can make you anxious and depressed (see chapter \ref{nurturing})
\end{itemize}

So beware of rejection, try not to take it personally. Beware of rejection, it's a normal part of job hunting. 🤮

\hypertarget{rollercoaster}{%
\subsection{Beware of the rollercoaster}\label{rollercoaster}}

There are highs and lows in job hunting, you will ride the job search rollercoaster shown in figure \ref{fig:rollercoaster-fig}. There will be highs, you'll be invited to interviews, but there will be also be lows too, such as the inevitable rejections we discussed in the previous section \ref{rejection}. It will be a rollercoaster, which ends on the high of a job offer you accept. Fasten your seatbelt, enjoy the ride and good luck with your applications and interviews! May the road rise with you! \citep{rise}

\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn\%27t_read}{Too long, didn't read} (TL;DR)? Here's a summary:

We've looked at search techniques that will help you find opportunities you care about. Figuring out what you want to do is tricky at times but it usually works out well in the end. Finding your future is coding your future.

This chapter is under construction because I'm using agile book development methods, see figure \ref{fig:deathstar5-fig}.

Do you sometimes feel like the \emph{weird edge case} pictured in figure \ref{fig:default-user-fig}? Do typical graduate destinations such as large multi-national corporations, not really make you want to \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_Your_Thang}{Shake Your Thang}}? \citep{saltnpepa}

\begin{figure}

\caption{Are you a weird edge case? By default, many graduates choose a graduate scheme with big brand, often a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_chip_(stock_market)}{blue-chip multinational} employer. While working for these kind of employers has many benefits, they are not the whole story.

Broadening your initial job search described in chapter \ref{finding} will open up more opportunities on your horizon. This chapter will broaden those horizons and get you to think about some of the less obvious options, because I \emph{love} weird edge cases and you should too. 😻

Many technology jobs exist outside of technology companies, \citep{outsideit} because a lot of software is written to be \emph{used} rather than sold. Consequently, many employers create bespoke software to fit the needs of their business. The people who build it are often employees, rather than people employed by a technology company. In the United States for example, ninety percent of IT jobs are outside the traditional tech industry. Technical jobs outside the technology sector often have the advantage of being more accessible than those within a very competitive technology sector. \citep{burninglass}

What do these roles entail?

\hypertarget{rse}{%
\section{Research software engineering}\label{rse}}

There are plenty of roles in computing working in research, either in computer science, or working alongside natural scientists, such as Physicists at \href{https://home.cern/}{home.cern} or conventional scientists working at the laboratory bench. For example, there are \href{https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-01516-2}{lots roles in research software engineering} (RSE), using software engineering to facilitate better scientific research, see \href{https://society-rse.org/}{society-rse.org}.\citep{rses} For example, CERN employs ten times more engineers and technicians than research physicists, see figure \ref{fig:cern-fig}. For physicists to understand the data that pours off the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider}{Large Hadron Collider} (LHC), you need armies of engineers to enable the scientists to do their work. A \emph{lot} of those engineers are working on hardware and software, and many of them won't be physicists. \citep{hullcern}

\begin{figure}

These are mainly UK opportunities, but it is a similar story around the world. Many Universities and research institutes have summer internships for computer science students working alongside researchers. For example, at the University of Manchester, summer vacancies tend to be advertised each year around April/May. Wherever you are, speak to the head of a research lab you're interested in. Ask them if they have plans to take on summer students.

If you're thinking of doing postgraduate study, see chapter \ref{researching}. Commercial experience gained on a summer internship or placement year is valued by \emph{all} employers (not just commercial ones) so doing an internship or placement during your undergraduate degree is valuable wherever you end up, see section \ref{realworld}.

\section{With great code comes great responsibility}\label{peterparker}}

Computer scientists wield tremendous power in the twenty first century. We know that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  With great power comes great responsibility \citep{spiderman}
\item
  With great code comes great responsibility \citep{responsiblecs}
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}



Given the growing power of computing in the twenty-first century, computer scientists have a duty to society to use that power responsibly and justly. How can they do so? Do computer scientists need to sell their soul to the highest bidder? How can computer science be used to make the world a better place, not just making rich people richer? Lets look at these in turn

\hypertarget{soul}{%
\section{Do you need to sell your soul?}\label{soul}}

You will sometimes hear people saying you need to sell your soul to get a job, shown in figure \ref{fig:diabolical-fig}. See for example:

So when you're searching for jobs and researching potential employers, one of the first things you need to find out is what the values and ethical principles of an employer are, see section \ref{beware}. This is a quick way to evaluate what makes an organisation who they are. Most employers publish their values and ethics openly, here's a small selection to give you a flavour:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Amazon \href{https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles}{amazon.jobs/en/principles}
\item
  Microsoft \href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-values}{microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-values}
\item
  Apple \href{https://www.apple.com/compliance/}{apple.com/compliance}
\item
  Google \href{https://ai.google/principles/}{ai.google/principles}
\item
  Morgan Stanley \href{https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us/morgan-stanley-core-values}{morganstanley.com/about-us/morgan-stanley-core-values}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/morgan-stanley-times-square} 

}

\caption{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley}{Morgan Stanley} is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered in New York City. The firms clients include corporations, governments, institutions and individuals.

\end{figure}



Let's look at Morgan Stanley (figure \ref{fig:morgan-stanley-fig}) as an example, I've chosen these values because they are brief and self-explanatory. Morgan Stanley's values are to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Do the right thing: act with integrity
\item
  Put clients first: listen to what the client is saying and needs
\item
  Lead with exceptional ideas: win by breaking new ground
\item
  Commit to Diversity and Inclusion: value individual and cultural differences
\item
  Give back: serve communities generously with expertise, time and money
\end{enumerate}

Look at these values carefully, or choose the values of another employer you're interested in. What do they mean to you?

Do an employers words match their actions? The words \textbf{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don\%27t_be_evil}{Don't be evil}} are easy to \emph{say} but harder to \emph{action}. Good intentions are often easier said than done.

So back to our original question, do you have to sell your soul?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You don't have to sell your soul \citep{iwannabeadored}
\item
  It depends what's in your soul anyway
\item

\chapter{Speaking your future}\label{speaking}}

Congratulations, you've been invited to an interview. It might be by telephone, video link, in person or as part of an assessment centre where you'll be asked to complete several other tasks and tests. Being invited to an interview means that your written application (CV, covering letter, application form or digital portfolio) has hit the target and is bug free, see figure \ref{fig:bugfree-fig}. All that reading and writing has paid off. BULLSEYE! 🎯

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/My CV is bug free} 

}

\caption{If you have got an interview, then you have proved that your CV is bug free. That doesn't mean your CV is perfect, it just means that it is good enough to get you an interview with that particular employer. Congratulations! What comes next?

\end{figure}



Having passed the first stage of \emph{reading and writing}, you move onto \emph{listening and speaking} stage of interviewing. One of your goals is to convince the interviewers that you can articulate yourself clearly, and communicate well by listening carefully to their questions and answering with spoken natural language. These are fundamental communication skills discussed in section \ref{cio} on communication I/O.

If you've got an interview, you can feel good about having a bug-free CV shown in figure \ref{fig:bugfree-fig}. Now you have a new set of problems to tackle. How can you prepare for the interview? What kinds of interviews exist and what questions might you be asked? If they offer you a job, how will you negotiate the terms, conditions and salary? Do you \emph{really} want the job and are they the kind of people you actually want to work with everyday? If successful, you will be giving this employer:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  most of the hours of your day
\item
  most of the days of your week
\item
  most of the weeks of your year
\end{itemize}

This job will take a significant chunk of the next few months, year or even up to two years (and more) for a graduate scheme \citep{jonathanblack}. It's the start of a much longer journey of up to \href{https://80000hours.org/}{80,000 hours} that you'll spend in employment during your life.

So you want to ensure employers are a good match and not going to waste your time. You'll be interviewing them, as well as them interviewing you, so it will pay to have some questions prepared alongside your answers to questions you can anticipate.

\hypertarget{ilo9}{%
\section{What you will learn}\label{ilo9}}

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify kinds of interviews you might be invited to
\item
  Anticipate common interview questions, both technical and non-technical
\item
  Prepare questions for your interviewer by researching the employer
\item
  Formulate strategies for negotiating job offers
\item
  Calm your interview nerves
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{interviews}{%
\section{Interviews}\label{interviews}}

Broadly speaking there are two basic kinds of interviews:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  non-technical interview, sometimes called competency based interview or human resources (HR) style interview, see \ref{hrinterview}
\item
  technical style or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_interview}{coding interview}, see section \ref{codinginterview}
\end{enumerate}

These can be conducted in various modes:

\item
  real-time face to face
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hrinterview}{%
\subsection{Competency interviews}\label{hrinterview}}

Competency interviews test some of your softer skills, find out who you are (see chapter \ref{knowing}), how you work in a team and if you can communicate well. A good interview strategy for any interview is to talk about what you are doing (and what you have done) as shown in figure \ref{fig:overthinking-fig}. It might even help to have a checklist in your head of things you'd like to talk about such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  one work experience, see chapter \ref{experiencing}
\item
  a couple of projects, see section \ref{mycvpj}
\item
  some university projects, see section \ref{mycvpj}.
\end{itemize}

If you can, make sure you've mentioned everything on your checklist by the end of the interview.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/Marketing-rule-No1}

\caption{During an interview, you are marketing yourself to an employer while they market themselves to you. It can be easy to overthink your marketing. A simple marketing technique is to just talk about stuff you're doing, projects you've worked on (inside and outside University), your experience and any other relevant activities. \href{https://bryanmmathers.com/the-1-rule-of-marketing/}{The number 1 rule of marketing} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:overthinking-fig}

Here are some common competency interview questions. Imagine you are going on a stage, prepare lines that answer these questions, rehearse them out loud in front of a mirror (or a critical friend).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What roles do you play in a team, with examples?
\item
  Tell me about a time when you showed integrity and professionalism
\item
  Can you give an example of a situation where you solved a problem in a creative way?
\item
  Tell me about a big decision you've made recently. How did you go about it?
\item
  Give an example of a time you resolved conflict
\item
  How do you maintain healthy working relationships with your team?
\item
  Describe a project where you had to use different leadership styles to reach your goal
\item
  Give me an example of a challenge you faced and tell me how you overcame it
\item
  How do you influence people in a situation with conflicting agendas?
\item
  Tell me about a time that you made a decision and then changed your mind.
\item
  Tell me about a time when you achieved success even when the odds were stacked against you.
\item
  Tell me about a time when you have provided an excellent service
\item
  Give me an example of a time when you have had multiple deadlines to meet? How did prioritise your workload?
\item
  What would you say is your main development area?
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

Since there's already tonnes of information on competency based interviews, the rest of this chapter will focus on technical interviews, also known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_interview}{coding interviews}.

\hypertarget{codinginterview}{%
\subsection{Coding interviews}\label{codinginterview}}

Many employers use technical or coding interviews to assess your harder skills. Not every employer does, but they are widely used by employers. Preparing for coding interviews is a good way to become a better engineer, so even if you don't have to face a series of really tough coding interviews, it is worth knowing about them.

⚠️ \textbf{Coding Caution} ⚠️

The competitive coding and technical interviews described in this chapter test a narrow set of algorithmic skills. While it's important to prepare for technical interviews, \href{https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-criticisms-of-Cracking-the-Coding-interview}{they have well documented limitations}. \citep{murashenkov} Skills required for software engineering go beyond the purely technical ones. For example, your (soft) communication skills outlined in chapter \ref{writing}, and many other broader skills, are just as important as your (hard) technical abilities.

There are a lots of resources to help you prepare for and practice coding interview questions, a good place to start is \emph{Cracking the Coding Interview} by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell}{Gayle Laakmaan McDowell}. \citep{cracking} As well as reading Gayle's book, there are lots of online resources to help you prepare for coding interviews. Before we look at those, Computer Science graduate Petia Davidova explains in figure \ref{fig:petia-fig} what she learned from failing several coding interviews at big technology companies. 😭

\begin{figure}

{\centering \href{https://www.youtube.com/embed/qkeQNNjZuQk}{\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{cdyf_files/figure-latex/petia-fig-1} }

}

\caption{Petia describes her worst software engineering interview failures. Petia demonstrates a growth mindset (section \ref{growthmindset}) and productive failure(s). Although she failed her earlier interviews, she learned lots from the process and went on to get a job she wanted. If you can't click on the embedded video in the figure, you can watch the full 16 minute video at \href{https://youtu.be/qkeQNNjZuQk}{youtu.be/qkeQNNjZuQk} \citep{youtube-petia}}\label{fig:petia-fig}
\end{figure}



Coding interviews can be tough, but preparing for them, and doing them will make you a better engineer. So if you spectacularly wipeout in your coding interview, reflect and think how can you improve next time? Perhaps you need to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Read up on some more data structures
\item
  Familiarise yourself with more algorithms
\item
  Practice thinking out loud (verbally) by doing a mock technical interview?
\end{itemize}

All of these activities will help both your general professional development and your chances of success in future technical interviews. Thankfully there are plenty of resources out there for helping you get better at coding interviews, so let's have a look at some. Some of these resources are more about problem solving for recreation, rather than interview preparation, but they will all help you become a better engineer.

\hypertarget{leetcode}{%
\subsection{Leetcode}\label{leetcode}}

LeetCode is a platform to help you enhance your skills, expand your knowledge and prepare for technical interviews, see \href{https://leetcode.com}{leetcode.com}. There's \emph{lots} of challenges on leetcode which can make it a daunting place for novices, thankfully \href{https://neetcode.io}{neetcode.io} has recorded a handy series of videos to help you navigate them all, see figure \ref{fig:neetcode-fig}

\hypertarget{hackerrank}{%
\subsection{HackerRank}\label{hackerrank}}

HackerRank allows developers to practice their coding skills, prepare for interviews and get hired. HackerRank allows users to submit applications and apply to jobs by solving company-sponsored coding challenges. Some employers use hackerrank as part of the interviewing process, so these are not just academic exercises.

Hacker Rank provide a discussion and leaderboard for every challenge, and most challenges come with an editorial that explains more about the challenge, see \href{https://www.hackerrank.com/}{hackerrank.com} and figure \ref{fig:hackerrank-fig}

\hypertarget{icpc}{%
\subsection{ICPC}\label{icpc}}

More than 50,000 students worldwide from more than 3,000 universities in 111 countries participate in over 400 on-site competitions as part of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) see \href{https://icpc.global/}{icpc.global} and figure \ref{fig:icpc-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/International-Collegiate-Programming-Contest}

Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world.'' \citep{icpc}}\label{fig:icpc-fig}
\end{figure}



ICPC is organised by the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery}{Association for Computing Machinery} (ACM), a global community which advances computing as a science and a profession.

There are subregional contests for ICPC, so in the UK there is the United Kingdom and Ireland Programming Competition (UKIEPC) which is part of the Northwestern Europe European Regional Contest (NWERC).

UKIEPC has been held annually since 2013 to help universities pick teams to travel to NWERC. Ask your University if they are involved, see \href{http://ukiepc.info}{ukiepc.info}. If they aren't involved yet, you could encourage them to join. It's not just about winning, it's also about taking part.

\hypertarget{offer}{%
\section{Accepting job offers}\label{offer}}

If you've been successful in an interview you will receive a job offer. This is time to celebrate (congratulations!) and in some cases negotiate.

If you're not happy with the package on offer, the best time to negotiate is \textbf{before} you accept it. It is often easier to negotiate now, than get a pay rise later. This is one factor that means people leave jobs, it is often easier to get a pay rise by moving employers, rather than being promoted with an existing employer. Knowing your value is important here, its easy to find out with sites like glassdoor we mentioned in section \ref{generaljobs}.
Besides the pay, you might also want to negotiate about flexible working, start date and any benefits on offer.

\hypertarget{comms}{%
\section{Communication, communication, communication!}\label{comms}}

Interviews are about a lot more than the answers you give to questions, they also test \emph{how} you communicate, both verbally and non-verbally. We looked at communication skills in section \ref{cio} and throughout chapter \ref{writing} on \emph{writing your future}. This chapter has discussed some spoken communication skills which complement your written communication skills.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{images/carole-goble}

\caption{Computing is about much more than technology. Interviews will test some of your spoken communication skills, these are fundamental in working with and for people. \citep{frengoble} CC BY-SA portrait of scientist and engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Goble}{Carole Goble} by Rob Whitrow on Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/5542}{w.wiki/5542} adapted using the \href{https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238}{Wikipedia app}}\label{fig:carole-goble-fig}
\end{figure}



Computing is not just about technology - it is actually more about working with and for people, see figure \ref{fig:carole-goble-fig}. So as well as testing technical knowledge, an interview (coding interview or otherwise) is a test of \emph{how} you communicate in spoken language, not just how you speak, but how you listen and converse while you work with other people. \citep{frengoble}

Starting a new job is a bit like starting a new relationship, except that it is professional rather than romantic. You've searched for and found a partner. You've been through the courtship of recruitment, this might have been quick or may have had many rounds of first and second ``dates'' (interviews). Once you start employment, you are both committed to each other in a serious relationship. Simply put, there are three scenarios for you as a new employee. You'll survive, thrive or dive.

\hypertarget{survive}{%
\subsection{Survive}\label{survive}}

Your new job will go OK, you'll meet the expectations of your employer and become and valued employee. If your employer has a probationary period, you'll pass your probationary review without any problems. Most employees probably fit in to this category. 🆗

\hypertarget{thrive}{%
\subsection{Thrive}\label{thrive}}

Your new job will go brilliantly, you'll exceed the expectations of your employer. If you're on a fixed term contract, such as a summer internship or year long placement, they'll make you a job offer during or soon after your contract of employment expires. If you're on a more permanent contract, such as a graduate job or graduate scheme you'll be promoted and given more responsibility. 💪

You're doing really well if you can impress your manager. Some lucky people make it into this category.

\hypertarget{dive}{%
\subsection{Dive}\label{dive}}

Your new job will go badly, you will struggle to fit in and won't meet the expectations of your employer. Once you were like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-crossed}{star-crossed lovers}, (see figure \ref{fig:romeo-fig}) but the relationship has turned sour and could take a disastrous dive into \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy}{tragedy}. \citep{romeo, goblewroe}

There are several relationship problems that could lead to you breaking up with (or being dumped by) your newly estranged ``lover''. 💔

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Relationship problems}: Your relationship with your manager(s) is not going well. You've tried solving problems informally by talking to your manager but you're not satisfied with the response and want to \href{https://www.gov.uk/raise-grievance-at-work}{raise a formal grievance complaint in writing}. \citep{grievance}
\item
  \textbf{It's not you, it's me}: You might ultimately decide to you want to \href{https://www.gov.uk/handing-in-your-notice}{hand in your notice} to terminate your contract of employment and leave. \citep{iquit}
\item
  \textbf{It's not me, it's you}: If things get really bad, your employer may \href{https://www.gov.uk/disciplinary-procedures-and-action-at-work}{take disciplinary action against you} \citep{dive} and in the worst case scenario, you'll be \href{https://www.gov.uk/dismissal}{fired (dismissed)}. \citep{yourefired}
\item
  \textbf{Becoming unhappier}: You were looking for a job and now you've found a job. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Knows_I\%27m_Miserable_Now}{Heaven knows you're miserable now}. \citep{miserablenow} Perhaps you're not being challenged enough or given too much work that you're not interested in? Perhaps the honeymoon period is over, you've experienced \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill}{hedonic adaptation} and start to get disillusioned? \citep{lauriesantos}
\end{itemize}

Dismissal is rare, but it \textbf{does} happen, even to interns and placement students. In this scenario in the UK, the employer has a duty to do everything they reasonably can to prevent this from happening. It's not in your employers interests to fire you because they've invested a lot of time and money in you by this point. If they have sensible recruitment procedures, those procedures will root out unsuitable candidates long before they make it to the workplace where they can cause real and lasting damage to the organisation once in post.

All employers have procedures for making sure that you can agree on work that suits both of your needs. Better employers will have better procedures to ensure this happens. Employers don't want their employees to ``dive'' and will try prevent this from happening wherever possible. So, speak to your manager(s) and keep the communication channels open. Talking of managers \ldots{}

\hypertarget{manager}{%
\section{Managing your manager}\label{manager}}

Building a good relationship with your manager(s) will be key to determining which of the \emph{dive, survive or thrive} scenarios above plays out. At University, you didn't have a manager. Yes you had deadlines, but you didn't have a boss. That changes when you're an employee so it's in your interests to understand what your boss expects of you.

Software engineer Julia Evans has authored a series of programming \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine}{zines}, there's one called \href{https://wizardzines.com/zines/manager/}{HELP! I have manager!} \citep{helpihaveamanager} you might find useful. It will help you understand your managers job better so that you can work together more effectively. It will help you survive and thrive, not dive because it covers:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  understanding your manager's job
\item
  setting clear expectations
\item
  talking about problems early
\item
  reviewing performance and getting promoted
\item
  asking for specific feedback
\end{itemize}

The zine has the benefit of being aimed at engineers just like you. Thoroughly recommended! You might also enjoy Julia's other more technical zines such as:

\hypertarget{neverstoplearning}{%
\section{Stay in school}\label{neverstoplearning}}

As you develop new skills and knowledge at work, it is a good idea to collect evidence of what you've done. Whatever your career path, you'll need to keep your CV updated. One way to think of the evidence is as \emph{badges}, digital or otherwise. Your employer may already have training schemes that recognise and reward your accomplishments. These badges may be generic or specific to the particular sector you are working in. See chapter \ref{achieving} on \emph{Achieving your future} for more details.

\hypertarget{techie}{%
\subsection{Technical badges}\label{techie}}

Some examples of technical badges include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Microsoft Certifications \href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/}{docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications}
\item
  Amazon Web Services Certification \href{https://aws.amazon.com/certification/}{aws.amazon.com/certification}
\item
  Google Cloud Certification \href{https://cloud.google.com/certification}{cloud.google.com/certification}
\end{itemize}

Just three examples, there are many others covering both technical and non-technical skills. In many cases, your employer will encourage and possibly pay for you to get these certifications.

\hypertarget{techieplusplus}{%
\subsection{Non-technical badges}\label{techieplusplus}}

You are more than just a techie, so make sure you develop your non-technical skills as well. We introduced softer skills in chapter \ref{writing}, but there's plenty of other skills to think about:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Building resilience
\item
  Negotiating and managing conflict
\item
  Leadership, influence and change
\item
  Having difficult conversations
\item
  Emotional intelligence
\item
  Public speaking
\item
  Active listening
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{mooc}{%
\subsection{Online \& lifelong learning}\label{mooc}}

There are many online platforms for building your skills and knowledge, some examples include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://www.coursera.org}{coursera.org}
\item

\item
  \href{https://www.youtube.com}{youtube.com}
\end{enumerate}

The choice of online learning can be bewildering. Some platforms provide free resources, others do not, but your employer may already pay for some services making them free to you while you are an employee. If that's the case, make good use of the services while you can. There's a \href{https://www.businessinsider.com/online-learning-platform-comparison-udemy-skillshare-lynda-coursera}{useful comparison of four different online learning platforms here}. \citep{udemy}

\hypertarget{othertrain}{%
\subsection{Other training courses}\label{othertrain}}

Your employer may provide other courses you can go on. Again, you should make the most of these if and when they are available.

Whatever job you're doing, stay in school. Take advantage of any training on offer or go and find courses that help you develop professionally and personally. Remember that \textbf{you} are the person who cares most about your career, see section \ref{responsibility}.

\hypertarget{visits}{%
\section{Breakpoints}\label{visits}}

Let's pause here. Insert a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint}{breakpoint} in your \texttt{code} and slowly step through it so we can examine the current values of your variables and parameters.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

Besides collecting evidence and managing your manager, you need to manage yourself too. A proven way to do this is to periodically reflect on your work. Your employer may have procedures to help you do this, such as performance reviews or one-to-ones with your manager on a regular basis. Whatever the setup, you will benefit from taking time to reflect on:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What have you been doing?
\item
  WWW: What Went Well?
\item
  EBI: Even Better If?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{what-have-you-been-doing}{%
\subsection{What have you been doing?}\label{what-have-you-been-doing}}

Briefly describe your roles and responsibilities. What projects have you worked on? What were the main technologies that you used? As well as describing this to colleagues, you should aim to communicate this with non-specialists, people outside your field. How would you describe your job to your friends and family and terms they would understand?

\hypertarget{www-what-went-well}{%
\subsection{WWW: What went well?}\label{www-what-went-well}}

Are there any projects you are particularly proud of? What new knowledge or skills have you learned or improved? Remember to include both non-technical as well as technical aspects of your job. Non-technical skills include organisation, time-management, confidence, communication etc. What did you \emph{think} about these achievements and how do they make you \emph{feel}? What have you learned?

\hypertarget{ebi-even-better-if}{%
\subsection{EBI: Even Better If?}\label{ebi-even-better-if}}

What areas have you identified for improvement in the future? Again, this includes non-technical as well as technical skills. What do you \emph{think} about these improvements and how do they make you \emph{feel}? What have you learned and what will you do differently in the future?

\hypertarget{your-managers-view}{%
\subsection{Your managers view}\label{your-managers-view}}

If you asked your manager the same questions, would they come up with the same answers? Are there any differences between your view and your managers view of your work? If so, why do they differ?

\hypertarget{reflecting}{%

The \texttt{WWW}/\texttt{EBI} activity in the breakpoint above is an example of reflective writing. You may have come across this already, but developing the ability to reflect is a key skill in:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  learning how to learn
\item
  learning how to think more critically
\end{itemize}

The video in figure \ref{fig:reflecting-fig} summarises what reflection is and why its important to your future.

\begin{figure}

\hypertarget{tldr10}{%
\section{Summarising survival}\label{tldr10}}

Too long, didn't read (\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn\%27t_read}{TL;DR})? Here's a summary:

Making the transition from education to employment can be a big and daunting change. To make the change as smooth as possible, you may need to readjust your expectations because being a student is very different to being an employee. Some key differences include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You have a manager when you are an employee, who you need to maintain a good working relationship with
\item
  Your performance is much more dependent on other people (your colleagues), unlike in education where you can often work more independently (e.g.~when completing coursework or revising for an exam)
\item
  You get paid, which hopefully makes it all worthwhile!
\end{itemize}

Some of the keys to \emph{surviving your future} are therefore:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Communicating early and often with your manager(s) about any issues you have in the workplace, see section \ref{manager}
\item
  Regularly reflecting on your progress, with and without your manager, see section \ref{reflecting}
\item
  Understanding that working with people is challenging for everyone (and enjoyable for many), see figure \ref{fig:frances-fig}
\item
  Staying in school. Despite leaving formal education, you should never stop learning, see section \ref{neverstoplearning}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{achieving}{%
\chapter{Achieving your future}\label{achieving}}

Learning is a lifelong process, a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop}{\texttt{while} loop} in which you continually develop new skills and knowledge. As you loop the loop, you will collect evidence of your personal and professional achievements. Some of these achievements can be certified or ``badged'' in various ways. This evidence can be collected as part of your professional identity and reputation, the jar called \texttt{ME} in figure \ref{fig:while-learning-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/earning-a-badge-hd}

\caption{Learning is a lifelong loop where you constantly acquire knowledge and skills.

\end{figure}



Evidence is a key part of your ``Context, Action, Result and Evidence'' (CARE) story described in section \ref{care}. So what evidence can you collect and how you can certify or badge these credentials, sometimes known as micro-credentials? 📛 \citep{microc}

\hypertarget{ilob}{%
\section{What you will learn}\label{ilob}}

After reading this chapter you will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe some the evidence and micro-credentials you can collect and badge to show your achievements:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    during University
  \item
    after University and throughout your professional career
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Identify any gaps in your personal and professional achievements
\item
  Plan activities and set goals for future achievements that will help you to continue grow professionally and personally
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{academentia}{%
\section{Academic badges}\label{academentia}}

One kind of badge you get when you finish University is your degree certificate like the one shown in figure \ref{fig:degree-cert-fig}. A degree certificate is an important offline physical (paper) badge that marks a milestone in your career. If you like gaming, its a huge \texttt{achievement\ unlocked} that will take you to the next level. Your certificate also tells people that you were a member of a particular University community and that you mastered your chosen discipline to some level, Bachelors, Masters or PhD.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/a-certificate-is-just-a-badge} 

}

\caption{Level up, achievement unlocked! A degree certificate is a milestone that provides evidence of your academic knowledge and skills gained while at University. \href{https://bryanmmathers.com/a-certificate-is-just-an-offline-badge/}{A certificate is just an offline badge} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND} via \href{https://dougbelshaw.com/}{Doug Belshaw}}\label{fig:degree-cert-fig}
\end{figure}



Degree certificates are an important badge, but they don't give very many details of your professional and personal story while at University. You could give more details by providing:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  your overall degree classification: first, second, third etc
\item
  your individual module grades, for example in an academic transcript or by listing them on your CV, see section \ref{mycved}
\item
  your projects, see section \ref{mycvpj}
\item
  your portfolio of work, if you have one
\end{itemize}

This data give a \emph{bit} more detail that a degree certificate does not but it is limited to purely academic achievements. You are \emph{much} more than your grades, because there's a lot about your character that is difficult or impossible to measure, see figure \ref{fig:more-than-grades-fig}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/i-am-more-than-just-my-grades}

\end{figure}



Employers will often want to see more detailed evidence of your character and your softer skills than those provided by degree certificates and grades. While academic achievements paint some broad brushstrokes of your professional identity shown in figure \ref{fig:fine-grained-fig}, they don't help employers see the finer details or much of the evidence.

\hypertarget{digibadge}{%
\section{Digital badges}\label{digibadge}}

Digital badges provide a solution to this problem, just like your degree certificate is a verified badge of your achievements, a digital badge does the same but in a digital way. Rather than being physical, a digital badge is virtual and transferable. It's just a \texttt{*.png} graphic file which has been digitally signed and contains metadata. This means it can be displayed on your CV, on social media such as LinkedIn or ``stacked'' into a digital portfolio collection as shown in figure \ref{fig:badge-properties-fig}.

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation}{Mozilla Foundation} have defined an open standard for digital badges \citep{openbadges} so that badges can be issued, hosted and certified by different organisations. \citep{belshaw}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Properties-of-Open-Badges} 

}

\caption{Digital badges have certified evidence inside, can be transferred between education and employment and can be stacked into collections or portfolios. \href{https://bryanmmathers.com/properties-open-badges/}{Properties of Open Badges} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/}{Visual Thinkery} is licenced under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND} for the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_and_Guilds_of_London_Institute}{City and Guilds of London Institute}}\label{fig:badge-properties-fig}
\end{figure}



A digital badge has certified data locked inside (shown in figure \ref{fig:data-inside-fig}) which details the achievement it has been awarded for including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{recipient} that's you!
\item
  \texttt{issuer} the organisation awarding the badge, e.g.~\href{https://twitter.com/PoppletonUni}{Poppleton University}
\item
  \texttt{badge\ name} e.g.~PASS leader badge (see figure \ref{fig:pass-leader-fig})
\item
  \texttt{badge\ image} e.g.~a digital logo
\item
  \texttt{evidence\ URL} a link to evidence
\end{itemize}

All this information is coded so that only the recipient and issuer can manipulate it, for example by associating an email address with it.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/peeled-badge}

Commercial or real-world experience is valuable in academia and academic experience is valuable beyond academia. So, if you think you need to choose between the two, think again. Doing an internship or placement with a commercial company can be useful background for a career in academia, both in research and teaching. Lots of research is done in partnerships between commercial companies and Universities, some of these create \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company}{startups}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_spin-off}{University spin-offs} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off}{corporate spin-offs} etc.

Your learning shouldn't stop when you finish University either, so you might work for a bit, study for a bit, work a bit more and so on. Some of this learning might be formal and academic with qualifications, others might be badged in different ways. This is called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning}{lifelong learning}, see section \ref{lifelonglearning} and chapter \ref{achieving}.

So will you choose University \textbf{OR} real life in the longer term? With all the \href{https://www.amazingif.com/listen/}{squiggles and zigzags}, your career is likely to be a bit more complicated than that\ldots{} {[}\citet{squigglybook};{]}

\section{Ask beyond academia}\label{prof}}

If you're thinking about doing a PhD and going into research, it's obviously a good idea to talk to Professors and academics about what is involved. Don't just ask Professors though, talk to PhD students, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher}{postdocs} and especially people who did a PhD but didn't go into academia. Most people with a PhD don't go on into academia as a career. \citep{postdochell} This means that asking a Professor if you should do a PhD is a bit like asking a Hollywood film star if you should become an actor. The film star can only give you part of the story that is likely to suffer from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias}{survivorship bias}. \citep{therock}

A good place to start if you're thinking about doing a PhD (or trying to get through one) is \emph{How to get your PhD: A Handbook for the Journey} by \href{https://twitter.com/profgavinbrown}{Gavin Brown}. \citep{howtogetyourphd}

I wish I'd had this book when I was a PhD student! I'm not just saying that because Gavin is a colleague of mine but this is a genuinely useful book which quickly tackles a wide range of issues you'll encounter during a PhD from the technical to the psychological. The second half also contains a range of short viewpoints on doing a PhD from people including \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Rothwell}{Nancy Rothwell}, \href{https://twitter.com/drvikkiburns}{Victoria Burns}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber}{Steve Furber}, \href{https://www.lucykissick.co.uk/}{Lucy Kissick}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiranya_Peiris}{Hiranya Peiris}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Leng}{Melanie Leng}, \href{https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jlw/}{Jeremy Wyatt}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hand_(statistician)}{David Hand}, \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolyn-virca-3446b558/}{Carolyn Virca}, \href{https://shakirm.com/}{Shakir Mohamed}, \href{https://medium.com/@jonnybrooks04}{Jonny Brooks-Bartlett} and \href{https://fromphdtolife.com/}{Jennifer Polk}.

\chapter{Ruling your future}\label{ruling}}

In 2005, the scientist and engineer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Bourne}{Phil Bourne} starting publishing a series of articles which distilled people's hard won knowledge into \emph{\href{https://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules}{Ten Simple Rules}}. \citep{Bourne2005} Over a decade more than 1000 rules were published in over 100 articles in the scientific journal \emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_Computational_Biology}{PLOS Computational Biology}}. \citep{Bourne2018} These articles offer a huge range of advice from making the most of a summer internship \citep{Aicher2017} to teaching programming \citep{tensimplebrown} and even winning a Nobel Prize. \citep{Roberts2015} Articles as lists, or ``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle}{listicles}'' as they are sometimes known, are a convenient way to summarise key points. So here are \emph{Ten Simple Rules for Coding Your Future}: the too long, didn't read (\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn\%27t_read}{TL;DR}) summary of this guidebook.

There is a lot more to you than your degree. There is a lot more to you than your grades. Yes, you've spent (or will be spending) three or four years getting your degree. Use this time to identify your weaknesses and work out how to improve them. Knowing your future depends on knowing who you are now, see chapter \ref{knowing} and figure \ref{fig:knowing-fig}.

Being able to articulate your self-awareness to employers will make writing a CV (chapter \ref{debugging}) and interviewing (chapter \ref{speaking}) a lot easier. Both rely on you be able to express yourself in written and spoken language. You should aim to strike a balance between humbly underselling yourself (see section \ref{undersell}) and proudly overselling yourself, see section \ref{oversell}. If you have digital profiles like those described in section \ref{portfolio}, how accurate a reflection of you are they? Is your digital \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego}{alter ego} at odds with reality?

\hypertarget{onlyhuman}{%
\section{Look after yourself}\label{onlyhuman}}

Studying at University can be enjoyable but it can also make you stressed, anxious and depressed. If you neglect to look after yourself mentally and physically, things can start to fall apart. Choose your reference points carefully, try not to compare yourself to the person at the top of the class: see Carmen's advice in chapter \ref{carmen}. Ask yourself, am I doing better than last time? Be kind to yourself because nurturing yourself now will nurture your future, see chapter \ref{nurturing}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/Look after yourself} 

}

\caption{It's important not to neglect your body, mind and soul when you're working hard. Look after yourself by \href{https://visualthinkery.com}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND}}\label{fig:lookafter-again-fig}
\end{figure}



At University, you are quite likely to be surrounded by people who have more experience, better knowledge, higher grades or more skills than you. That might not have been the case at high school if you were top (or near the top) of your class. While it is natural to compare yourself to the best, you should do so with caution. The important thing is that you are working to towards the best version of yourself, not necessarily the best in your class anymore.

\section{Use what you have}\label{gregwilson}}

It's too easy to fall into a trap of thikning \emph{if I had\ldots{}} when job hunting. Use what you already have, see figure \ref{fig:usewhatyouhave-fig}.

This rule is borrowed from software engineer Greg Wilson \href{https://github.com/gvwilson}{@gvwilson} in figure \ref{fig:greg-wilson-fig}, who probably adapted it from a quote frequently misattributed to Theodore Roosevelt \citep{teddy}.

Getting a job offer is competitive and can be cut-throat. You might find yourself falling into poor habits of mind:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``\emph{If I had a better degree from a different university, I'd be more successful\ldots{}}'' see section \ref{entitled}
\item
  ``\emph{If I had more experience, more voluntary work, more internships, I'd stand a better chance\ldots{}}'' see section \ref{areuexperienced}
\item
  ``\emph{If I'd done more projects and extra-curricular activities\ldots{}}'' etc see section \ref{mycvpj}
\item
  ``\emph{If I'd got better grades at school and Uni\ldots{}}'' see section \ref{academentia}
\item
  ``\emph{If only I'd worked harder\ldots{}}'' see \ref{regret}

\item
  ``\emph{If I'd been to a different school, I could be more successful\ldots{}}'' see the \href{https://www.93percent.club/}{93percent.club} \citep{93bbc, 93guardian}
\end{itemize}

Coulda. Woulda. Shoulda. This is all the usual dialogue you can expect from your inner critic. Acknowledge these thoughts, see section \ref{lays}, then try distance yourself from them. Start from where you are, use whatever you have and help who you can.

\hypertarget{networking}{%
\section{Grow your networks}\label{networking}}

Grow your networks, make use of all the contacts you have and foster new connections where you can. Improve the connections you already have by spending time talking to people and hearing what they have to say. People can help you, \emph{especially} those you're not particularly close to, see figure \ref{fig:yournetwork-fig}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/Grow your networks}

Remember that the weaker ties in your network (see section \ref{weakties}) may be more important than your stronger ties, especially when it comes to finding jobs. \href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it\%27s_not_what_you_know_but_who_you_know}{It's not (just) what you know, but \emph{who} you know}.

\hypertarget{estherdyson}{%
\section{Always make new mistakes}\label{estherdyson}}

You can classify your mistakes and failures into two categories:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Productive mistakes: those you learnt from
\item
  Unproductive mistakes: those you didn't learn anything from (and risk repeating)
\end{enumerate}

Mistakes and failure are inevitable in life, but productive mistakes are going to help you much more that unproductive ones \citep{henrypetroski}. That doesn't just mean you should ``\emph{fail fast, fail often}'' \citep{failfast} or ``\emph{move fast and break things}'', but to consciously learn from any mistakes you make so that you don't repeat them. One way to turn unproductive mistakes into productive ones is deliberately and consciously reflect on why you made them. This is part of the growth mindset we discussed in chapter \ref{nurturing}.

In a growth mindset, mistakes can be good, but the fear of making them is not. You are more likely to take more chances when you're unafraid to fail, and this will improve your chances of success.

Many education systems around the world don't teach people how to fail, because they put too much emphasis on success (as measured by grades and rewards) rather than progress, learning and happiness. \citep{failgift, punished} So as the angel investor \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson}{Esther Dyson} once said, ``Always make new mistakes'', see figure \ref{fig:esther-dyson-fig}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/esther-dyson-always-make-new-mistakes} 

}

\caption{Mistakes are inevitable in life, so there's no shame in making them especially if they are new. Making \emph{new} mistakes can be a form of productive failure that you learn from rather than a source of unproductive failure that you repeat (old mistakes).

\item
  If you've got some harsh feedback on your CV, how can you make less buggy in the future?
\item
  If you've applied to lots of companies and not even had a reply yet, how you improve your job search strategy?
\item
  If you've neglected to develop interests and projects outside of work, how can you rebalance?
\item
  If you crashed and burned in an interview, how can you use the experience to do better next time?

Computer science is a young and rapidly changing discipline which means you can not afford to be left behind. Don't let your mind retire. \citep{thewire} Never stop learning, see chapter \ref{achieving}.

\hypertarget{comfy}{%
\section{Step outside your comfort zone}\label{comfy}}

Research has shown that we often to learn more when we are uncomfortable. You will often learn more when you step outside your comfort zone and reach for things that push your limits. Sometimes when you think you are learning. Learning is an active process that requires you to do things rather than just being a passive observer or consumer. \citep{sigman23, sigman23-extra}

Am I being insensitive asking people to step outside their comfort zone when we've all be stretched beyond breaking point during COVID-19, climate change and global economic turmoil? We're all going to need to continue to step outside of our respective comfort zones in order to meet the challenges we face around the world, see figure \ref{fig:comfortzone-fig}.

\chapter{Hacking your future}\label{hacking}}

It's very easy to overlook mistakes in your own writing because its difficult to be both an \emph{author} and an \emph{editor} of the same text. That's true of any written communication such as a covering letter, personal statement, email, essay or any message that you write. Mistakes are particularly common in CVs (or résumés) because they so personal. You can spend \emph{hours} carefully polishing the words and the formatting but not see a fatal error at the top of page one. Hacking\footnote{The term \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(disambiguation)}{hacking} is a horribly overloaded word with many different meanings, but I'm using it here to mean an ``ingenious temporary solution to a problem''} other people's CV's will help you debug and improve your own. You may need to use ingenious hacks like the temporary fix to the bridge in figure \ref{fig:kludge-fig}. Fixing other peoples bridges will help you improve your own bridges, see section \ref{parti}. You'll build better bridges to more interesting and ambitious destinations.

A useful hacking technique is to take somebody elses stuff and fix or improve it. That works for written communication as well as actual \texttt{code}. The dogfooding technique described in section \ref{dogfooding} is a useful hack which you can use by:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Eating your own dogfood again, re-reading and re-editing repeatedly
\item
  Persuade someone else to eat your dogfood - get feedback from as many people (and bots see section \ref{robotproof}) as you can
\end{enumerate}

So, here are some fictitious CVs for you to hack, from students of Computer Science. They are based on CVs I've seen, warts and all, with personal information removed and anonymised.

\chapter{Moving your future}\label{moving}}

Finding a job often involves moving to a different city or even a different country. So a simple way to improve your job prospects is to broaden your job search (chapter \ref{finding}) and consider all the alternatives, geographically and otherwise. Some of the alternative options are outlined in chapter \ref{broadening}. This chapter looks at some UK alternatives to London.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.32\linewidth]{images/notjustlondon} \includegraphics[width=0.32\linewidth]{images/notjustlondon} \includegraphics[width=0.32\linewidth]{images/notjustlondon} \caption{Like many capital cities, London dominates the economy of its country. There are clearly some fantastic employers offering great opportunities in London but they do not represent everything that is on offer in the UK. There are plenty of good career options outside of capital cities like London if you don't want to live and work in a huge metropolis. The transition to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work}{remote and hybrid working} also means you don't \textbf{have} to live in a large city. Not just London Image by Sharon Dale \citep{notjustlondon}}\label{fig:northern-fig}
\end{figure}



\hypertarget{south}{%
\section{Hit the South?}\label{south}}

For example, if you're seeking work or further study in the United Kingdom, there are lots of possibilities in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxbridge}{Loxbridge} (\textbf{Lo}ndon, \textbf{Ox}ford and Cam\textbf{bridge}). While Loxbridge undoubtedly offers many fantastic opportunities for your professional growth and development, it does not represent \emph{all} of the best opportunities that exist in the UK see figure \ref{fig:northern-fig}.

\hypertarget{north}{%
\section{Hit the North!}\label{north}}

If you're looking for a job in the UK you don't have to exclusively target the South (London) to find top employers, there are plenty located in the North too: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_the_North}{Hit the North}. \citep{hitthenorth}

\textbf{Looking for Northern jobs in the UK?}

See a partial list of tech employers at \textbf{\href{https://git.io/manc}{git.io/manc}}

Northerners have often argued that Northern England offers a better quality of life than London we couldn't possibly comment other than to say its horses for courses. The North West Tech Community calendar, provides a window on (and networking opportunities with) many of employers based in the North West \href{https://technw.uk}{technw.uk} if you want to find out more. As Sharon Dale once said: its NotJustLondon \citep{notjustlondon}

So, it's wrong to assume that capital cities like London are where \emph{all} the best opportunities are. That's true in the UK and also in many other countries too, and the rise of working from home during the pandemic has changed our relationship with cities. You might need to consider moving your future.

This is a partial list of employers in the North West of England (aka the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Powerhouse}{Northern Powerhouse}) that recruit Computer Science students. This is not a comprehensive list of all tech companies in the North West, but will give you a quick flavour of employers in the Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Northern England.

\hypertarget{eastwest}{%
\section{Hit the East and West}\label{eastwest}}

It's not just the North or the South either: You should also hit the East and the West too, don't just look at big cities. Don't just look at big employers. Look beyond the obvious, chapter \ref{broadening} may help broaden your job search horizons.

In addition to these \href{https://www.techuk.org}{techuk.org} and \href{https://technation.io}{technation.io} provide more information on technology businesses outside of London.

\hypertarget{tldr16}{%
\section{Summarising moving your future}\label{tldr16}}

The best jobs are not always in the obvious places. The myth that all the best graduate jobs are in London (or Paris, Berlin, Silly Valley etc) is clearly not the case, see figure \ref{fig:uuk-fig}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/uuk} \caption{It's a myth that all the best graduate jobs are in London and other capital cities or centres for technical innovation like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley}{Silicon Valley}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Alley}{Silicon Alley} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Fen}{Silicon Fen}.

Music is deeply connected to your mental health and your sense of wellbeing that we discussed in chapter \ref{nurturing}. Music has the ability to comfort and connect you to others and yourself by providing motivation, gratification and empathy. There's plenty of scientific evidence that listening to music can enhance your mood. \citep{zatorre, dopamine}

Besides entertaining you and lifting your spirits, there's also lot of wisdom captured in the lyrics of many songs too, offering sound advice on how you can live your life. If that wasn't enough to convince you that music is important for your future, there's no shortage of links between mathematics and music too. \citep{behindthemusic, musicnmaths}

In \emph{Hearing your Future} (chapter \ref{hearing}) we ask our guests (coders) to recommend a tune that is important to them.

In 1951, engineers of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1}{Ferranti Mark 1 computer}, implemented a \texttt{hoot()} function that was used to sound a prompt when input or action was required. \citep{turingmanual} Alan Turing realised that this could be reprogrammed to make different notes and created a routine that played a note of a specified pitch. \citep{hooturing}

Cherished by men of a certain age, the Dad-rock playlist thrives on past glories but is a shadow of its former self. Proponents of Dad-rock can't understand why more people don't enjoy these seminal tunes of yesteryear \citep{dadrock, dadrock2}:

Wetter and muddier than the traditional summer downpour at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival}{Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts} in Somerset (see figure \ref{fig:glastonbury-fig}), this playlist encourages you to swing your cardigan mournfully while \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze}{shoegazing} and wondering if its \emph{ever} going to stop raining, either metaphorically or meteorologically: ☔️

\hypertarget{actioning}{%
\chapter{Actioning your future}\label{actioning}}

Employers are often more interested in what you have \emph{done}, rather than what you just \emph{know}. Your actions are a key part of your story we discussed in section \ref{care}. A simple technique for emphasising the \texttt{action} in your stories is to lead descriptions of your projects, education and experience with carefully chosen \texttt{verbs}, see section \ref{verbsfirst} for examples.

\hypertarget{impact}{%
\section{Your actions define your impact}\label{impact}}

Your actions define your impact, see figure \ref{fig:action-fig}. What stories you can tell of your actions to date? What verbs best describe how you achieved a result or had an impact? What was the context, action, result and evidence (CARE) we discussed in section \ref{care} of each (short) story?

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/your-actions} 

}

\caption{What action have you taken and what stories can you tell about the results and your impact? What are the best verbs for highlighting your actions? \href{https://bryanmmathers.com/your-actions-define-your-impact/}{Your actions define your impact} by \href{https://visualthinkery.com/}{Visual Thinkery} is licensed under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/}{CC-BY-ND} via \href{https://twitter.com/AngelaMaiers}{Angela Maiers}}\label{fig:action-fig}
\end{figure}



By leading with verbs you will highlight what you have \emph{actually done} and how you did it, rather than what you know. See the verbs first section \ref{verbsfirst} of chapter \ref{debugging} \emph{debugging your future}.

\section{Summarising your actions}\label{summarising-your-actions}}

Too long, didn't read (\href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn\%27t_read}{TL;DR})? Here's a summary:

Actions speak louder than words, or as suffragette and political activist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst}{Emmeline Pankhurst} frequently said ``Deeds not Words'', see figure \ref{fig:pankhurst-fig}. Your CV needs to emphasise your deeds and actions using words. Those words are \texttt{verbs}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/deeds-not-words-pankhurst} 

}

\caption{``Deeds not words'' was the rallying cry of suffragette \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst}{Emmeline Pankhurst}. Emphasise the deeds (actions) on your CV by leading your stories with carefully chosen \texttt{verbs}. Public domain image of Emmeline Pankhurst by Richard Gordon Matzene restored by Adam Cuerden on Wikimedia Commons \href{https://w.wiki/3bPa}{w.wiki/3bPa} and adapted using the \href{https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238}{Wikipedia app}}\label{fig:pankhurst-fig}
\end{figure}



Leading with \texttt{verbs} is a simple but powerful technique that enables you to provide evidence (rather than assertion) for the skills and knowledge you have. Choose your \texttt{verbs} carefully. Which verbs are missing from your CV? These verbs can help you identify gaps in your professional and personal development.

\hypertarget{scheduling}{%
\chapter{Scheduling your future}\label{scheduling}}

You might find it a bit scary thinking about your future. You might be tempted to procrastinate making important decisions about your future, see figure \ref{fig:schedule-fig}. There is a risk of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)}{thrashing} or getting stuck in a \texttt{do-nothing} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting}{\texttt{busy\ waiting}} loop. This guidebook is here to help you break out of that loop. One way to breakout of an unproductive loop is to schedule some time every week where you work on personal development and job applications. Doing good applications takes time and you'll probably find you can't do as many applications as you might like.

\section{What's your story Raluca?}\label{ralucastory}}

My guest today is Raluca Cruceru. I want to find out a little bit more about your story and your journey from arriving here. Four years ago, is that right? Three and a half years ago? Yeah, it was it three and a half years now, isn't it? Can you tell us a little bit about yourself your name and where you're from?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Yeah, of course. My name is Raluca Cruceru. I am 22 years old and originally from Romania. I came to the University of Manchester to study computer science. And here I am now in my final year,
\end{quote}

about to graduate and go off into the big wide world. So I think it's always interested hearing what made what made people study computer science so what was it that made want to study it? While you were doing your exams, applying to Manchester and what why did you study why did you choose to study computer science as a subject? Not why Manchester necessarily, but why computer science?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Well, I think that everything I've experienced before university connected together to my final decision, when I was a child, I was always interested into how computers work or what they work that they work, but of course at the time, everything was worried. But then in high school, it became more clear that I'm attracted to this idea of technology and computers. My class was focused on mathematics and informatics. So therefore, I was always into this kind of information. The solving problems became natural for me I could spend hours doing that. So at the end of the high school, it was obvious that I wanted to do something concerning Computer Science and Mathematics. And it was a decision between mathematics and computer science. And I chose computer science because it felt like something that could be used in more circumstances in more industries, and more linked to the general technology. Yes.
\end{quote}

So did you I guess, did you do you must have done a fair amount of computer science at high school did you do much in the way of coding in high school or was it more more focused on the mathematics?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: It was focused on the mathematics but then we also started to code in high school, and I think this is actually what helped me a lot to realise that they want you to do computer science. Also one of my exams that I chose at the at the end of my high school was boring informatics. I kind of fell in love with this idea. So yeah, yeah.
\end{quote}

So, how did you go about deciding whether that was something that you wanted to do?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Initially, I didn't know about this option to have one year experience in industry. But when I found about it, I was really excited because I think for myself, the hands on experience, very important. And of course, we did all the way behind and all the lessons but I really wanted to understand what software engineering job actually requires. So as soon as I found out about this option, I was motivated to take it. I started to search for possibilities.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{web-applications-uk}{%
\section{Web Applications UK}\label{web-applications-uk}}

So this typically, most people are looking for placement style that are getting their second year. So after you've done the first year, so what sort of what sort of places did you apply to and what you were looking at lots of different things. You weren't focused in on one, one or two places?

\begin{quote}
Raluca Well, to be honest, I was very focused on certain because I knew I wanted to work there. However, my I was very doubtful. Regarding my chances. I thought it was my only option. I applied for other companies in the UK. In places like CERN will expect you to have, or your application will stand out a lot more if you've got some experience like Yeah.
\end{quote}

So you've done a summer job Web applications UK, which is now called, they've changed their name now to \href{https://www.koder.ly/}{Koder.ly} with a \texttt{K}. So, you've got a broad exposure to different sorts of software engineering ideas, working in a team and that kind of stuff.

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Yeah, it really meant a lot because it's one thing to work on a lab at university to be in another thing to work on something that you know, can impact a whole number of people. So it makes you want to do a good job. You know, that you're, the stuff that you're writing is is going to be used by hundreds, sometimes 1000s of people
\end{quote}

I think that's one of the satisfying things about software engineering is knowing that what you've made can get ended up getting used by lots of people

\begin{quote}
Raluca: but stressful, stressful and exciting in my opinion, right? Yeah, there's, there's lots of places it can go wrong. Isn't that I think when you're building software,
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{cern}{%
\section{CERN}\label{cern}}

okay, good. So, I think you mentioned you were particularly focused on CERN. I think they have two application rounds. Is that right? So you applied in the autumn?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: No, actually applied in the second one, from May onwards.
\end{quote}

All right. So you didn't you didn't apply in the first round in autumn?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: In the second round in May,
\end{quote}

I guess lots of people have heard a lot about CERN but what can tell us more about CERN as an organisation and what your what your role was, while you were a technical student there for a year?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: so the European organisation for Nuclear Research in Switzerland, and their main focus is on high energy physics research. They operate the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. The main focus is to unravel the mysteries of the universe, more specifically, how it was formed, and from from there to understand how it will evolve in the future. And the thing that attracted me the most was the fact that they push the frontiers of not only science, but technology computing, and also medical technology. And maybe a lot of people know that the \href{https://home.cern/science/computing/where-web-was-born}{World Wide Web was created there in 1989} (see \citep{cailliau} for web history and also birth of touchscreen technology \citep{stumpe}) And it's interesting to know that I was to a university where we have a software that has no computers, and then go through the transition that created the World Wide Web. Like everything is connected. And, of course, I knew about since I was a child that I didn't really imagine that there would actually work there. It was just like something to dream about when you go to sleep. But yeah, in the end, I got accepted. And I worked as a software engineer in the electrical engineering department. Basically, my task included building and maintaining software applications for the department for monitoring projects of cabling and fibre optics there. And I have several tasks to do, building technical panels that would extract and migrate information from different databases regarding this project. Then, a dashboard that was monitoring the project's evolution and generating statistics regarding the quantities of cables for the radiation dose intake. And then after that, those two pieces were published on the department website, which I also maintained. So as you can see, there were a lot of tests and I learned very much how to be able to handle multitasking that time.
\end{quote}

The thing that thing that I think is perhaps most surprising about CERN is the fact that for every scientist they employ there are 10 engineers (see figure \ref{fig:cern2-fig}), and an awful lot of those engineers are software engineers, but you've also got the hardware and electrical engineering as well. So there's an awful lot of engineering that goes on.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}



\begin{quote}
Raluca: I mean, it's a big, it's a big machine underground, basically, isn't it at the end of the day. machines need lots of engineers. So there's lots of lots of stuff but I guess it was nice being part of a international community while you were there, because you're you're meeting people from all over literally all over the world and principally Europe, but you and an all students and staff coming together in the community they created there? It's so beautiful. There are scientists and engineers from around the world. And the atmosphere is just great. You feel like everybody has the same purpose. And we have something to collaborate for, and something to work on together. It just brings people together from different domains is great.
\end{quote}

So with that, so when you applied to CERN, what was what was your strategy because I know you have to write sort of a personal statement type thing where you you describe your interests. So were there were there any things that you emphasise Did you particularly tailor what you'd written to particular groups at CERN? Because there's lots of different groups certain doing software engineering is not just one, did you? Did you tailor it at all? Was it was there anything? Anything that you want, you know, how did you go about applying?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: The thing that I knew was that when you apply there's not a specific departments to apply to? So you're applying and then you were sent to a specific group. But yeah, I spent a lot of time in trying to make my application. Having having a personal touch. I was as honest as possible about why I wanted to work at CERN about what you personally I respect what they do. And of course, I try to talk enough and a lot about what makes me a good candidate for them. Yeah, I think we, in general, I think when applying people should put a lot of focus on details. Even if you think that something is not relevant to put the accent on. It can be actually something that makes you stand out. Even at the time, I was not sure how would be accepted even with all these efforts. I was still doubtful. I reminisce it takes quite a long time to do it as well. So every application and in particularly a certain application takes a long time to have to think quite hard about what you're being asked and what you're going to say. And yes, you never know if any of this is going to come to anything it can be quite demoralising sometimes filling in all these forms and writing all these personal statements when you never actually know if you'll get a reply. Yeah, because they asked you not only about what you can do, but more questions to see what kind of person you are. And what do you want to bring into the department we're working? Yeah, they have to pay a lot of attention.
\end{quote}

So you were at CERN for, was it 12 months or were you there for slightly longer did you extend over the summer?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Yes, it was initially one year but then I had the contract extension with three more months when they proposed that to me, I was more than happy to accept it. And of course, I had to confirm it with university. And luckily it was accepted.
\end{quote}

Did you learn any French when you did you? Do you speak any French when you're out there and or was it mostly in English? That you were speaking?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Mostly in English, but also in French and we have French courses when we went for the first time there so the beginners could choose to have a French course for a couple of months. So I learned a little bit. I cannot say now they know enough to go didn't want to talk about difficult for me, like switch back to the English system. Like you were living in in France or Geneva in France because it's close to the border, isn't it of France. Very close in the border is open so you can just pass.
\end{quote}

So did you spend any time exploring around Geneva and parts of France that you're in or did you have any chance to see see see, see the country while you were there?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Were a couple of citizens in Bern, I think from Switzerland, but it's my favourite city. It's a small city but it's very beautiful and I think when somebody has the chance to go to CERN, there are a lot of things to do and to visit. You can just go hiking, if you're bored because nature is around there. Yeah.
\end{quote}

Are you do you ski or snowboard at all? Is that somebody a winter sports person as well?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: there was a ski club at CERN, but I didn't go this year. But now I will. I will try to go with them. Because at the beginning I was not a very winter sport person. But now I'm going to push myself because it seems very, very fun. Yeah. It can be quite expensive and expensive sport but when you're living close to the mountains, it's it becomes a lot more affordable. Because you know it's only a 30 minute drive away or whatever it is, whereas normally it involves hiring an expensive chalet and you know, and all that stuff, but I think we're living in a country. It's sort of it's it's a good thing to do. Yeah.
\end{quote}

Okay, good. So you came back from 15 months, I suppose at CERN into your final year.

\begin{quote}
Raluca: So actually, before before I move on to that, actually, so what would you say was the most enjoyable or rewarding part of the placement and you mentioned that you're part of this international community and learning heaps of stuff. There's anything that really stands out for you, from what you've got from your year from your year at CERN. Yeah, so first, of course, is the whole community that I found there. So I just felt like my place was exactly that. Well, I think one of the most important thing is that I learned how to multitask a lot, how to be able to learn new things, because I think a couple of years ago, I thought that okay, if you if you feel like you can now learn this specific skills, skill, you will never learn it. But in the end itself, there were so many things I had to learn that I didn't even have time to worry about not being able to find it and yeah, I learned details that I never thought I would understand. Also, not in my area of expertise. For example, details regarding cables, fibre optics, I never I never got in contact with that before. Yeah. And also, it wasn't my first experience seeing how what you're doing is actually used and has impact on people. And it gave me this sense of purpose, because I had full responsibility over my tasks. It made me even more excited to do a good job. Those were the most important thing is I enjoyed it.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{final-year}{%
\section{Final year}\label{final-year}}

Good. Okay. So yeah, so we, you came back from your year at CERN, or just over a year at CERN last September and came into your final year. So what were you doing your final year project? Can you tell us a little bit more about what you did for your final year project?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Yes, I was working on a project related to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering}{neuromorphic computing}, which is concentrating or building computer architectures that lay the working in the structure of the human brain and I worked on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiNNaker}{SpiNNaker}, which is the computer built at our university. The idea behind it is to implement spiking neural networks, which are artificial neural networks that have computational elements that mimic real neurons. And my job was to build a new neural models implementing Spinnaker to be able to see if it provides the right behaviour that we were expecting. And I was lucky to be lucky able to live for it and in the end, it was working. And I saw how, how complex and complicated it is to hear even one neuron. How complicated is the field another full network of neurons. And the reason I chose this project is I believe this area of research is very interesting. Being able to simulate the real brain will not only bring progress into computer science, but also neuroscience, for example, just a platform where neuroscientists to analyse the brain and see how it works or how does it do that? Yeah, was a great journey for me this year. Yeah, so that was that's part of the Human Brain Project Isn't
\end{quote}

it always amazes me the the, the size and complexity of the human brain is far beyond what we can currently even begin to simulate. I think I forget the figures, but how many how many mice brains is spinnaker now up to how many how many mice can you can simulate the brain for the rat cortex at the moment Right.

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Yeah, but other than that, I guess it is evolving pretty fast. So who knows? And that's a lot of that's a lot of silicon, isn't it?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
How many processors do you have on Spinnaker at the moment? And it cause? I don't know for sure how many they are to be honest. So the part I think, was it last year or the year before they passed a million core. So a million cores which is which is an insane amount of power. But it can it can you say all that power. You can only simulate a rat Cortex A brain a bit of a rat and use a huge amount of power and your your brain the brain inside your head does that on something like about 40 watts or something? It's it's much much lower. It's amazing, but it's amazing. It works at all. With all the speed and learning progress of the brain. I think it's not even fully understood by neuroscientists. So simulating it it's even harder because it's not fully understood. Yeah, so your supervisor, your supervisor for that was

Right. Good. So so the next thing then is, well, there's two things really. You're planning for the future. So I know that sounds actually unusual in that a lot of students who go to CERN aren't recruited so that they can go back after they have done an a placement. Students go back to their employer after they graduate, but with a lot of CERN students, that's not the case because they have this educational thing where the money that they're getting from the European member states, and sort of condition of getting that money is that they educate and train people all over Europe. So it's not just about recruiting lots of engineers doing a placement there. It's about spreading the knowledge of all the technology and systems and know how that is it sends spreading that around as widely as possible around Europe. And so in your case, you are you are actually planning to go back I think you might be the first University of Manchester students go back other \href{https://joshhdawes.github.io/}{Josh Dawes}, went back there to do a PhD. But there aren't so many students who go back not because it's not a nice place to work. It's just because the way that there's paper temple students ships are set up as is to encourage people to learn some stuff and then move on to somewhere else. So your plans for the future are to go could to go back to CERN. Is that right? Yeah.

\begin{quote}
Raluca; So luckily for me, I was offered a graduate position in the experimental physics department on our major experiment that they had there.
\end{quote}

Is that a different group to what you're working on before?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Yes, it's the experimental physics department and it's on the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALICE_experiment}{ALICE experiment}, which I can talk about if you want. Yeah. So that'll be another adventure. Then I guess, in terms of stuff that your stuff that you're going to be learning
\end{quote}

Do you know, do you know too much about the group or what they're doing it?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Yeah, I already know something because I wanted to get into that position. I knew about it. But of course, I was not sure I would be accepted. And I was. It's called a large iron collider experiment. It's one of the experiments at CERN where they studied the properties of matter, at extreme densities and temperatures, the collisions of the accelerator, and I will be working on a technology for organised distributed data analysis that is dedicated to storing and accessing the physics data output from ALICE. Yeah, and this is very important for the allosteric output to be able to be accessed by scientists and analysed.
\end{quote}

So the Graduate Programme is on is it called a Graduate Programme and do they call it a scholarship or what? It is a fellowship or fellowship? Okay. So how long is the fellowship for is it for a fixed term?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: It's three years, three years, six months, and then you can extend it. It's a trial period of six months. And then if you manage to First up, you can extend it up to three, three years.
\end{quote}

Do you know what you might do?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Um, no, no, three years is obviously a long time.
\end{quote}

So it's almost as long as you've been studying as an undergraduate to do you have any sort of plans after that or any sort of things that you're thinking of in the future that you might like to do after this period of three years?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: I'm not sure to be honest, I could. Because once you finish that you can also continue at certain with, for example, a sub contract if you want to, and he managed to get it, but I'm thinking that maybe I will find something that I'm very passionate about a specific kind of software technology. And who knows, maybe try to have a master or PhD if I'm not sure the moment or just stay there and work head on carry on being an engineer without doing any further study. So I guess I'm there's lots of options there for the future.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{rselfie}{%
\section{Advice to your former self}\label{rselfie}}

Sounds good. So I've got two two final questions, really. So one is, these interviews are aimed primarily at other students. So what advice would you give to students who are looking for either summer internships or placements during their first and second years of study? What would you what would you advise them to do? What do you think they should be doing?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: I think I could talk a lot about that. So yeah, first, I think they should try to find companies or organisations that they identify with what they appreciate. Because this way they will be more dedicated to make a good application. And also if they get accepted, they will be more happy to be happier to work for that specific company or organisation we should try to find companies or organisations that they identify with what they appreciate because this way they will feel more dedicated to make a good application. And also if they get accepted, they will feel more happy. They will be happier to work for that specific company or organisation. Then a lot of effort, a lot of effort has to be put into the application. I know myself because in the second year I realised that a lot of talented students that want the same job, it's very important to be able to stand out with some personal touch of the application or opening the CV so putting a lot of effort in that is important. And then I think, I think it's just pretty much it.
\end{quote}

I think the point you're saying about personalization is very important, because I hear stories about how many the volume of applications that the more competitive schemes and CERN's probably one of the more competitive ones is, you know, it's hundreds a day of applications. Yeah, you have to remember that there's a human being on the end of that, who has to somehow try and find that stuff that they're interested in. And it's the easiest way one easiest way to do that is to go through ones and just avoid ones that just look like they're generic applications.

\begin{quote}
Raluca: I'm sorry to say that I have a third advice. Do not apply to one company. Right. It's a very risky. It's very important to be able to have a backup, or who knows maybe that backup that you have will actually end up being the company you want to work for. You never know.
\end{quote}

So what were your backups? I know, because it sounds obviously quite an attractive employer. Did you have any backups other than certain what there are other places you were thinking? Well, if I can't get certain then I'll do this. What other places were you considering at the time?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Yes, yes, I had. I had two others. There was \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataStax}{DataStax} and Koderly right. So I got to know that I could go there.
\end{quote}

I think it's always tricky balancing quantity of applications with quality because you can either do one or two really, really good high quality applications, but then if they get rejected, then you're stuck. And the other on the other end of the scale is the sort of scattergun approach where you just apply to lots. If you're doing lots of applications, then no, I've seen students do applications for 50, 60, 70 different internships or placements. And obviously, the more you start doing that, the quality starts going down. So you've got to try and balance the quality with the quantity and that's, that's not always an easy thing to do.

\begin{quote}
Raluca: They also have to keep track of the 70 applications.
\end{quote}

You may remember what you said, why did why was it I wanted to apply for that company, what is it that they do? And I think that it can also be bewildering as well because I mean, how did you find balancing those commitments with manage managing, you know, managing your second year of study, but then also you need to have a social life as well. And balancing all these commitments can be quite hard sometimes I think.

\begin{quote}
Raluca Yes, no, it was not easy because second year, it's busy with more things to do more labs and then you also want to apply for jobs. And you also want to have a social life. Exactly. So I try to organise my making pretty clear to know what am I doing today or tomorrow I, I usually make lists with what I have to do. And take, let's say, for example, that weekend that's free or at least one day in the weekend is free. And but I was very passionate and I really really wanted to get a placement. So I dedicated as much time as I could to them.
\end{quote}

And it's good to see that paid off.

\begin{quote}
Raluca: yeah, definitely.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{the-future}{%
\section{The future}\label{the-future}}

Okay, so the other question I had was, so we talked about your plans for the future. So what do you what would you say the most interesting thing or things happening in computer science or technology at the moment there any things that you think this is, this is a growing area? This is something that's going to be really, really interesting in the future?

\begin{quote}
Raluca : Yeah, actually. I will answer it in a personal way. neuromorphic computing that I talked about before bit of above unbelievably hard, actually. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so that's that.
\end{quote}

Is there any crossover there? So we've talked about physics and the CERN, the Large Hadron Collider and then you've talked about neuromorphic computing. And there are two, almost entirely separate fields. Is there any are there any sort of interesting crossovers between the two or any things that you think anything's you think might you might be able to apply from what you've learned in your final year project to to physics

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Yeah, this could be because, as we know, there's a lot of data generated from the physics experiments at CERN. We have around \textbf{1 billion collisions per second.} So we always have to find ways to store and process that data very fast. And very good not have those somewhere. So technologies such as neuromorphic computing, and this kind of architectures could maybe be able in the future to process information faster or better. Of course, now the link is not completely clear for me. I believe there could be some more way of using that knowledge to process the physics data generated.
\end{quote}

Because I know a lot of the computational power of Spinnaker, this neuromorphic computer has yet to be used. So you can build a very powerful computer but then you need people to be able to understand how to operate and then use the resources that that such a machine provides. So yeah, that's that that sounds that sounds very interesting. Okay, so I think I think I've covered all the ground I wanted to, it's interesting finding out a little bit more about what you've been doing what during your time here. It was great to hear about your experiences of CERN, and what you've got planned for the future. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we before we close off?

\begin{quote}
Raluca: Nothing, just maybe good luck to the students that are about to be in a placement or find a job?
\end{quote}

Yes, thank you for joining us Raluca. Now, I always struggle is I never know with the name. Who could do I emphasise the A or the you where do I put the stress? Is it RalUca? Or is it RAluca? Luca is Raluca right? Okay. Yeah. I, I because we have we have several other students called Raluca. And I always struggle with getting the emphasis rights

\begin{quote}
its a difficult name for somebody who's not Romanian.
\end{quote}

Yes. I don't think there's no there's not a near equivalent. But thank you, Raluca for joining us,

\section{What's your story Jason?}\label{jason-story}}

So welcome Jason. Thank you for joining the show. And I wanted to talk to you a little bit about what your journey's been from before you started studying here to now four years later. There's a lot has happened in the last four years so tell us a little bit about how you came to study computer science. So can you tell us a little bit about yourself and where you from? Where you studied, where you studied before you came to Manchester?

\begin{quote}
Jason: Yeah, so yeah, London through and through born and raised in London, living in London my whole life. Ethnically, I'm Nigerian. So my parents were born and studied in Nigeria before moving over here later and in terms of locations in London, I'm from East London. So it's like my main stomping ground. I guess I'll talk about how I got into computer science.
\end{quote}

Yeah, yeah.

\begin{quote}
Jason: I'd say the main way, computers are kind of is a weird one and I tell people the story, they don't really believe me, but I actually didn't really have much of an interest in computer science at school until I got to sixth form
\end{quote}

Did you do it (computer science) as an A level?

\begin{quote}
I'll get to that. That's part of the story. So I did, I did computer science and economics at GCSE those two that I chose. And essentially I really liked economics. I found it really interesting. And yeah, I wanted to take that further. I was kind of a \textbf{finance bro'} so to speak. I was really interested. I wanted to see where I could take it, but the problem was that when GCSEs were done and dusted, there were some issues with the teacher, our teacher, teaching us wrong parts of the spec and stuff like that. Essentially the grade I got in the final GCSE exam was lower than what I needed for the sixth form I would eventually be moving to off the back of those grades, if that makes sense. So my plan was kind of to get my GCSE and to move to like a like a more, a better sixth form. So I could get better education for A levels but the problem is that due to, you know, issues of the teaching and whatnot, the grade wasn't as high as it needed to be for me to take that subject at A level at the sixth form.
\end{quote}

Right

\begin{quote}
Jason: So you know, originally I wanted to do physics, maths and economics, you know I was planning on going down the finance route. Yeah, but yeah, they wouldn't let me do it. So I thought okay what's the next best thing or something? I enjoy and something I found pretty you know, easy at GCSE: computer science. I found I liked it, I enjoyed it. I found it pretty straightforward. I got, I think I got one of the highest marks in my year, for computer science, at GCSE. So, you know, that's pretty confident, I could, you know, do it and, you know, it makes sense.
\end{quote}

So, you did physics, maths and computer science?

\begin{quote}
Jason: Exactly. So I started that and yeah, that's really enjoy that. I grew to really love it. You know I got sided, you know, picking up getting prop learning how to code properly because, you know, the code you do at GCSE is very rudimentary and yeah, that kind of took me to university. I discovered computers. That's kind of came to me. It's kind of, by chance because if my sixth form had allowed me to do economics, I don't think I'd be here today. So yeah, it's pretty crazy, pretty crazy, but yeah,
\end{quote}

So it's doing A level that made, you think, actually, this is an interesting subject I like to do. I'd like to take further than just A-level.

\begin{quote}
Jason: exactly
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{jstanley}{%
\section{Morgan Stanley}\label{jstanley}}

Okay, interesting. So, and then so your story your arrived here, four years ago, you've done a three-year bachelor's degree with a year in industry. So can you tell us a little bit about that journey? I think you you did a placement at Morgan Stanley, wasn't it initially? You started looking for that beginning of your second year. So you tell us a little bit about how you found the job and that whole process.

\begin{quote}
Jason: Yeah. Essentially, just a ton of applications. I mean, I think the main thing for me, I wanted to keep my horizons pretty broad. I wanted to make sure I didn't limit myself to just tech companies or limit myself to any kind of niche. So and I always found finance pretty interesting how that mentioned before, you know, I always had that always had that prior finance interest. So essentially I was applying for you know, traditional tech companies, investment banks and yeah, after a bunch of applications I was able to get to the final round, the assessment centre of Morgan Stanley. I managed to smash that and then you know, got called in to do the placement. So that was yeah scheduled to be a year but obviously was caught a month short because of COVID. You know it's funny because I literally started in the middle of COVID.
\end{quote}

So that was all online. I guess.

\begin{quote}
Jason: Exactly.
\end{quote}

Were you in London or Manchester?

\begin{quote}
Jason: I'm back and forth. I mean coming up here, see some friends, do some work, why not? And yeah, so I only go to go into the office in the last, maybe two months of the placements, right? It was a bit, not ideal, but, I mean, you know, life gives you lemons, you make lemonade right? So, just took it for it was, and still managed have a really great experience off the back of it.
\end{quote}

Did, you do a rotation? Did you do two six months (rotations)?

\begin{quote}
Jason: I spent six months with the equity derivatives team, so that's working on like, I mean, not to get too jargony but essentially derivatives are like a type of financial product and I was with the equity derivative team, so like traditional like stocks and options and whatnot. So I was working on technology. That would essentially basically automate the process of passing requests for different financial products coming into the firm. So it was kind of like an NLP (Natural Language Processing) type project where clients will be able to kind of use chat system that Morgan Stanley had available and then some automated passing would be applied to their messages to basically determine like what product they want. Yeah. So that was the first rotation and the second rotation was with the FX flow team.
\end{quote}

FX is?

\begin{quote}
Jason: So that's \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market}{foreign exchange} for ``forex''. Forex essentially. So. Yeah, working like the currency, the currency exchange system systems and stuff like that. So yeah. I was able to learn, you know, a lot on both sides. I think the first one, the first rotation was kind of like a research. You type project what else kind of doing you know, some AI type stuff. Second rotation was more of a this traditional softeng role, I was kind of clearing out tickets. Just helping out of different bits and bobs, didn't really do anything, but specifically, I kind of just part of the software engineering team and this helped out and then I guess after my placement actually.
\end{quote}

So back to, because this is quite interesting for now economics. So a lot of people who do software engineering placements in banks like Morgan Stanley, Investment banks, like Morgan Stanley won't necessarily have any financial knowledge. So, how useful was your economics?

\begin{quote}
Jason: GCSE?
\end{quote}

Your general interest in it, as well. Some some engineers have little or no interest in economics. It's just well, this is a, this is a place where they do software engineering (and pay good salaries) so I'll work there. How useful is the economics interest in helping you with that?

\begin{quote}
Jason: It was really helpful because I already knew a lot of what they were talking about. At least the the basic ideas of what is a stock? What is a bond? What is this? What is that? That made that a lot easier and then additions that I took \emph{Fundamentals of Finance} in my in the second semester of university kind of in, not to the placement. So that allowed me to kind of like top up on my knowledge and make sure I kind of knew that at least some of the basic concepts. So, but even once I started, people are really like happy to explain stuff to you and explain concepts to you. So one thing, one thing I really the point of doing was to schedule meetings with the finance side of, you know. So basically any people, the finance people would work with because kind of the way things work in Morgan Stanley is kind of the tech teams are separate from the finance teams but you usually have a couple points of contact where you can kind of, get clarification on, you know, the requirements of what you're building or something like that. So I was able to kind of talk to finance, people. Get a better idea of what was going on as well. Talk to the people on, on my side, on the tech side to you knew what's going on. I'm from there. You know, I think I think one thing I'd say to people is that I think even if you don't have much finance knowledge, it's less about what you know when you start a more about what you're you know, willing to work. You're willing to put the work in.
\end{quote}

Being able to understand the business is always beneficial. You're not just a techie to write code, in a back room somewhere. You need to understand the business requirements and what they mean and how a business people see it, or how the traders see it.

\begin{quote}
Jason: Morgan Stanley is quite good with that, I mean there's training the first week you do like group training and where you get like a bunch of different talks. So there's tech specific talks, we're like which are just going to take people's understand that the tech stack and stuff and then there's general finance talks which are basically just you know what is an investment bank? You know, what does that mean? What is the buy and sell side and whatever?
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{jgoogle}{%
\section{Google}\label{jgoogle}}

So, following on from your placement, you've got a summer internship which was remote as well?

\begin{quote}
Jason: COVID, the gift that keeps on giving! So that was, I did some internship with Google which was actually yeah. It was a story that one. I've always been pretty ambitious. So for me like the placement I wasn't dead set amongst only obviously I did really find finance interesting but I wanted to hedge my bets and see, you know, after I think I finished a place with about three or four months to spare before I started university again. So I figured if I have that time and COVID is still a thing, I'm not gonna be going anywhere. So I might as well, you know, do an internship. So I was applying to, you know, a bunch of different places like Facebook, Bloomberg, a couple hedge funds. I was interviewing alongside the placement, which was pretty tough to be fair because preparing while working a full-time job. Really. Difficult a lot of late nights. Well, you know, I'd log off work and then turn around and be up, like, hackerrank (see section \ref{hackerrank}) and leetcode (see section \ref{leetcode}). But yeah, like, we'll see. It worked in my favour.
\end{quote}

Do you think you could have got that job at Google without the Morgan Stanley experience. Having that bit of experience helps because they'll ask you about situations: in my current job I'm doing this and that can help. Whereas, I think going from zero to Google is a big ask for a lot of people.

\begin{quote}
Jason: exactly. It definitely helps I'd say just from especially from a confidence perspective because by the time I'd even started applying and interviewing I had maybe five months under my belt with Morgan Stanley. So I was pretty confident in my abilities. I've gotten great feedback from my managers and everyone I'd worked with, put up with me pretty well. So from a conference effective and also from like a this in terms of my actual technical ability, I would definitely a lot stronger than I would have been. \textbf{One of the biggest reasons I recommend doing a placement to people was it allows you to tie together all the different concepts you learn in the bachelors} you kind of you pick up all (these) different concepts, but they come at you so fast. You don't have time to stop and figure out where they will, where what they mean relative to each other. I was able to get really competent and that made into the interviewing process like pretty straightforward. I got to pretty much everywhere I applied to, but you know, Google ended up coming through first. So I was pretty happy with that, basically the best company I could ask for.
\end{quote}

What were you doing at Google? I mean, I guess there's probably stuff you can't talk about but generally, what were you doing?

\begin{quote}
Jason: So yeah, I guess I was working with the Fitbit team. Fitbit, for those that might not know, was acquired by Google at the start of 2021. So that was literally a couple months before I started having they were acquired February or I think March 2021 and I started like July 2021. So right Fitbit hasn't actually been a part of Google for very long. It was like a Google internship but at the same time a Fitbit internships I kind of got a bit of both
\end{quote}

interesting.

\begin{quote}
Jason: Yeah it's a bit weird because their systems hadn't been fully integrated with Google systems yet.
\end{quote}

So migrating things

\begin{quote}
Jason: a lot of moving parts, lot of things going on. So I got to work with some Google people. Some people who don't know anything about Google or just with Fitbit, all they know is Fitbit, they are part of Google Now. So it was interesting and regards the actual technical details of the project I worked on, it's basically a smartwatch app so I was working on app for an upcoming Fitbit smartwatch. I can't go into details about what the app does but \ldots{}
\end{quote}

Google watch!

\begin{quote}
Jason: essentially so that was that was really cool. Yeah. Got to I've never done it kind of like smartwatch app development or even like that before.
\end{quote}

It's quite low level stuff was it? A bit of web application stuff but talking to to the hardware?

\begin{quote}
Jason: So basically the application star so designing that Google's really big on making sure your design is solid first before you start coding. So I couldn't even really do any coding for the first month of the internship. I did like a little bits here and there to get a feel. So did a lot of like app design stuff. Figuring out what it would look like on the smartwatch, what it should do in addition to some low-level stuff to actually do some new hardware. There were some new hardware functionality, that was coming to the watch that they were bringing bringing out that we wanted to make use of. But the problem was, there were no existing interfaces, like API interfaces between the code and the hardware for that particular piece of functionality. So, on top of having to design the app I also had to design that API from scratch. Thankfully I had access to the source code for the Fitbit SDK like at development SDK. I was able to dig into that and grab what I needed and glue stuff together and figure out with help from my manager. Thankfully the project was good because I got a feel for both the app design stuff and also the low level. How do I actually make this work from a hardware perspective? What should the API look like and I was left to do that by myself.
\end{quote}

Good experience!

\begin{quote}
Jason: It was really good experience.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{jfinalyear}{%
\section{Final year}\label{jfinalyear}}

So when you come back to university, after your two placements and internships, you came back to do your final year here and you essentially trying to pull all things all together. So what did you do? Your final year project on what?

\begin{quote}
Jason My final year project was a hand, gesture recognition system. It was an exploration the feasibility of making a really portable easy to use hand gesture recognition (system) that can use any machine, any architecture whatever. It evolved to taking a lot of existing technologies and bringing them all together. And yeah, one of the technologies I use is actually developed by Google called \href{https://google.github.io/mediapipe/}{media pipe} which I made use of to perform the hand tracking and feature extraction, which I then use a neural network to classify
\end{quote}

So taking some sort of video feed?

\begin{quote}
Jason: Exactly. So essentially a video feed being passed for if hands present inside the view of the camera features like strategies are basically just points on the hand and then that's fed into a neural network, which basically tells you okay, what gestures being performed. The idea is that I would create both create a really robust and lightweight system that can be used anywhere and also use it and apply it to a particular use case that improves the user experience, both from disabled and able-bodied people. So I took that and then used it with used with Spotify to make a music player which has allow you to increase and decrease volume. That was that essentially what I did,
\end{quote}

Good and so again, it gave you a chance to dig into a bit more AI stuff you haven't done a huge amount of up until that point?

\begin{quote}
Yeah, I'd done a bit on the course but I wanted to see what I could do to make AI work for me and just do my own thing with it, be creative with it because nothing like this had really been done before, especially using the technologies I was using. So that was the most interesting aspect of it. So I'm bringing all the different pieces together and seeing what if you could actually improve these experience for something which, yeah, which was proven to be the case, with some user surveys. I did with able-bodied and disabled people. I was pretty pleased about it.
\end{quote}

That's all done. You've literally just come from your presentation. So that's the end, your last thing, your last formal thing before graduation. So and what are your plans for the future. What? What comes next? What comes after?

\begin{quote}
Jason So the plan is, thankfully, I've received a return offer for both Morgan Stanley and Google, but I went with Google just because it aligns more with what I want to do long-term.
\end{quote}

In London?

\begin{quote}
Jason: Yes, so I'll be starting with Google in October later this year.
\end{quote}

Congratulations!

\begin{quote}
Jason: thank you so much. I'm just gonna take the summer easy, gonna be travelling, taking it easy a bit before after, you know, enter the working world.
\end{quote}

It's quite a rare opportunity to get that much time off when once you're working, you don't get three months off do you!

\begin{quote}
Jason: exactly
\end{quote}

Enjoy it!

\begin{quote}
Jason: All my placement money is going on this essentially. Longer term than that, I'd still find finance quite interesting. I think a part of me will always be interested in doing something that blends both tech and finance
\end{quote}

I was looking at Apple, who have been in the headlines recently because their pay system. They are behaving more more like a bank. \citep{applegoldman}

\begin{quote}
Jason: Oh yeah, yeah, expansions to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay}{Apple Pay}.
\end{quote}

They've been partnered with Goldman Sachs, But now they're doing everything on their own. Thats's an interesting space what's happening there. Who knows what the future will look like? What is a bank going to look like in the future?

\begin{quote}
Jason: Yeah, exactly that. \textbf{Everything's just gonna be one big tech company}! Maybe I should move to finance in a couple years. I love to you know maybe because like maybe a hedge fund, the work on like tech stuff there or go to kind of something more small to medium size. Like some kind of like fintech startup that kind of thing. Maybe that'd be cool. Like maybe three, four years from now. For the time being starting my career with Google and I'll see how well that goes
\end{quote}

Well enjoy and good luck.

\begin{quote}
Jason: So thank you.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{jminority}{%
\section{Minority report}\label{jminority}}

To finish up then, this bit is called \emph{Minority Report} so I'd be interested as you are a member of a minority group, you're black. I'd be interested to hear about what your experiences have been of being black in computer science but being black in the university but then also in the workplace as well. What's that been like, honestly? What could the university do? And what could we perhaps we in computer science do to make it more welcoming. It's difficult being in a minority for lots of different reasons. And then, perhaps what employers can do as well? Perhaps you could say a little bit about, Morgan Stanley and Google are both, keen to improve diversity in their workforce, but it's it's an uphill battle for everyone. Any thoughts on that and what how we can do it better in the future?

\begin{quote}
Jason: I think it's more just a case of my experience has been good. Like I've never felt, you know, out of place. I made plenty of friends on the course. I think the main thing is just there are very few black people in my yeargroup. I've been one of the first thing.
\end{quote}

How many?

\begin{quote}
Jason: I think when I first started in first year, my placement has shifted me away from some people. I think maybe about three or four people total
\end{quote}

Out of a total of 250 or so?

\begin{quote}
Jason: Yeah, similar at Morgan Stanley
\end{quote}

Was there more diversity?

\begin{quote}
There was but not much. I think in general I'm pretty used to being the only black person in the room or being close enough to it. I mean there were some other like a black people at the company,, I was able to get meetings on the board with but oh but particularly in in the tech space not that many having only only a few but I've made a lot of new contacts and that were black. In general, I'd say the problem isn't necessarily how I mean, bloody won't treat anything different. I think, especially in our part of the world, we're pretty far past that like nobody's, I think until I have never experienced any kind of prejudice, like while I was at work or anything like that but I'd say the main issue is just getting more people, more black people into that. These kind of spaces. So, like, especially considering that from like a socio-economic perspective people from my background don't tend to go to higher education or to even study computer science and to get into tech. So, I say the biggest thing, you know, both campuses and companies can do just keep them when they're doing. Keep trying to get more black people into these spaces and from a university respective, I'd say more could be done for regardless of that kind of helping with the financial aspects of university, offering more scholarships and bursaries and this, and that just kind of doing more to kind of ease the transition that makes sense.
\end{quote}

Yeah. Yeah

\begin{quote}
Jason it can be a financial problem for a lot of people
\end{quote}

Because I think computer science, regardless, whatever your gender or race or whatever. I thin computer science, sometimes people don't feel like they belong, right? So it's kind of making people feel like you belong here, whoever you are, and whatever your background, whatever you're interested in. Computer science is a subject that is for everyone. And it doesn't quite have that appeal or maybe no subject does really truly, but making it more appealing to a wider group of people would be beneficial for everyone. Difficult to get there.

\begin{quote}
Jason: Yeah, exactly. But yeah, in general, I'd say that experience has been I think in university in general, think the UoM I think the stats are like, less than 3\% of the student population is like black or anything like that.
\end{quote}

So the proportion in computer science pretty much reflects that.

\begin{quote}
Jason Yeah, university. Exactly. This aren't many black people in.
\end{quote}

The thing that really hit me was when you were in Morgan Stanley and you posted something on LinkedIn \citep{jasontimes} with your picture in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square}{Times Square} (New York, see figure \ref{fig:timesq-fig}).

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}



I've visited investment banks and that was when it kind of hit me. I hadn't realised, how white it was until I saw your face and thought, oh my god, that's Jason!

\begin{quote}
Jason: Ha ha
\end{quote}

Oh, I recognise him. How white that world is, its a very privileged world, there's lots of money but it's also very very white.

\begin{quote}
Jason: Exactly. And I think, I think that could hold some people from, like my kind of background back, people might grow up in like pretty black areas. A lot of people, their schools, all kind of look like them. And then they kind of shunted into the professional environment and they're not even, they haven't really had many interactions right people in general. Yeah. So that can be that can be issue for some people as well. Like thankfully I went to a pretty like diverse school. I got a pretty good mix of people at my school. I know people who like, in London they went to schools which would maybe night, 80 or 90\% black. So it's kind of like when they do kind of come to university and kind of leave that bubble, it's they can feel bit out of place. Yeah, that can definitely be an issue.
\end{quote}

I know in the US they have universities that are much more traditionally black, (see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities}{Historically black colleges and universities} (HBCUs)) and we don't again really have that is kind of yeah, strange on that.

\begin{quote}
Jason: Yeah. But I'm a big believer of different people mixing together and like, kind of, yeah. So I mean, in my opinion, I don't even think we'd even really need put like black campuses or anything like that. I think the biggest thing is just, just adding more diversity. You're getting a bigger mix of people and yeah. Yeah. But that's obviously something that has to be done over the very long.
\end{quote}

Yeah. Part of it is role models, as well, people can see. Oh, you know. This is possible. Something people can then. Did you do any work with schools? Well, I know Morgan Stanley does quite a lot of work with schools. Did you do any? They do stuff in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets}{Tower Hamlets}

\begin{quote}
Jason: I would have if it was in person but COVID there wasn't really much, I can't do. I was eager to, but I think when I go back to London, one thing I want to do is kind of start going to kind of like in the city schools and show. Like I'm just a regular guy from London. Regular black guy from London, like, nothing that crazy about me. I just worked pretty hard and managed to make something of this whole tech thing. So, yeah, I recommend all my friends, I'm always telling my friends, listen look at tech, tech is pretty good , pretty chill, you know, good money, you know, good work life balance. I would tell people, but I'm I think in addition to the racial thing, I say a briefing, the whole feel back from tech. And general. They kind of like what he is. It's not an easy subject. It's not easy thing to get into, but I think people think it's like impossible to get into you.
\end{quote}

You have to be a genius programmer!

\begin{quote}
Jason: I tell people. Oh yeah, I'm starting with Google. You must be amazing. You must be a genius. NO I'm not I'm not, I work pretty hard and you know I'm competent. I know what I'm doing but I'm not crazy. I'm not autistic. You know, specialists of anything really? I'm just find it interesting. I've worked hard and acquired skill that was good enough to know work at these companies. So that's what I tell people, you know? It's just, it's okay. If you take your time, you're willing to be consistent and you know do it as like a proper thing. I think \textbf{a big thing of tech is that you kind of have to do it over long period of time and just gradually soaking all the skills.}
\end{quote}

One of my colleagues (\href{http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sattler/}{Ulrike Sattler}) talks about learning, it's like sedimentation. It's like things settle slowly. You're not just going to get it straight away. It might take months, maybe even years to get it. For some subjects to actually click.

\begin{quote}
Jason: Exactly. What I think, a lot of people that I've spoken to try and get into tech and try and do coding. They could they do code for maybe like maybe two three weeks and then like yeah, I couldn't figure out. All right. You kind of need to do. Maybe I think you can't even say you've really given it a try until maybe six months. I say, three to six months of actual of graft and then maybe you can now, say, okay? Maybe this is or isn't for me.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{jtune}{%
\section{One tune}\label{jtune}}

Okay good. So to finish up then, this podcast is part of \emph{coding your future} and it has a soundtrack (see chapter \ref{enjoying}) with it. There are musical references in the text but because I'm older, a lot of the references are old. So, can you recommend us

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  One tune to rejuvenate our playlist with
\item
  One podcast that you've listened to or enjoyed
\item
  One film if there's time as well
\end{enumerate}

So let's start with one tune

\begin{quote}
Jason: One tune.
\end{quote}

It could be something that you helps you relax. It might make you feel happy or remind you of home or, you know, might be something that helps you study. Or maybe opposite. Something that helps you get your mind off study when you're when you're stressed.

\begin{quote}
Jason: I mean, if you're a big fan of hip hop, I'm a really big fan of hip hop, but that kind of thing, American rap and stuff. So, I say anything by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Toliver}{Don Toliver}. \citep{noidea} People probably might not have hard of it. I'm big. Big, big, big fan, right? So anything by him. If you want, like a chill, like hip hop, kind of vibe type thing.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{jpodcast}{%
\section{One podcast}\label{jpodcast}}

Yeah, good. Okay. And then one podcast that you listen to recommend

\begin{quote}
Jason: one, I really recommend is under the skin, by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Brand}{Russell Brand}. \citep{undertheskin} So for those of you may not know that Russell Brand was a really big Reality TV guy for a while but went on a bit of a bender and lost himself to drugs and addiction and stuff like that. Then he rediscovered himself, completely reformed himself and he has a podcast called under the skin where he brings different people on to talk about different things. Sometimes he'll talk about spiritual things to talk about, the concept of the soul, and what it means like, life and death and stuff like that. You can get really deep like that. Or he might do stuff about social economic stuff and current issues and current problems we have in our society right now. And yeah, it's really good, like blend of like just a bunch of different things. So yeah, I recommend if anyone looking to kind of broaden their horizons,
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{jfilm}{%
\section{One film}\label{jfilm}}

Sounds good. Well I'll put a link in the show notes and then the last one was a film any films? Any films that you'd recommend people go and watch. Netflix or wherever, wherever people consume films these days.

\begin{quote}
Jason: I recommend my favourite movie, probably of all time is The Matrix, the first one, \citep{thematrix} not the fourth one. That's come out now. Don't watch it. It's trash. The graphics are amazing. The CGI is amazing. The story. Yeah. Not so much I wasn't a great fan. But, I mean, the first original, the first matrix was one of the movies, I always tell people that and Iron Man \citep{ironman} are the things that made me like computers in first place. So I'd recommend The Matrix, (see figure \ref{fig:matrix-fig})
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/the-matrix}

\caption{\emph{The Matrix} depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, the Matrix, which intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. \citep{thematrix}}\label{fig:matrix-fig}
\end{figure}



How old is that film now?

\begin{quote}
Jason: That must be came out in the 2000s. Oh, 1999. 20 years ago Yeah, it's crazy you. Yeah, pretty much pretty much. Yeah, but yeah, good.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{jselfie}{%
\section{Advice to your former self}\label{jselfie}}

All right. Well, thank you, Jason and is there any other closing comments before we finish? We have one here that was advice to your former self. So what would you tell your former self or a current first or second year student who is studying computer science. What should they focus on?

\begin{quote}
Jason: I would say, the biggest thing is right, don't sell yourself short. You don't need to be a genius to work any of these places, why I've been telling people years below. You ask me about my experiences like you don't need to be crazy. Just work hard and know what you're talking about. Just be competent and believe. Honestly, have confidence, I think a big part of it is confidence. People kind of projects this idea of like, oh, I'm just not good enough to work at these places. And, you know, when people see me, I'm pretty outgoing pretty, like friendly guy. And they see me like, okay, I'm doing all the Morgan Stanley and Google, they think it kind of spins them a bit. They kind of think that in order to make make anything out yourself you need to give up life and do that make that your whole life. I mean, you have to work hard but I still go out on the weekend. I'll still. I've got holidays lined up for the summer. I'm still doing my thing. So I think biggest, biggest piece of advice is have confidence and, you only and \textbf{you only need one YES}
\end{quote}

Okay. That's a good note to finish on. So thank you. Jason

\hypertarget{carmen-story}{%
\section{What's your story Carmen?}\label{carmen-story}}

So, welcome Carmen thank you for coming on the show. The purpose of this interview is to catch up with you, find out a little bit more about your journey from arriving here, four years ago through to your journey while you've been here and what comes next? So what should we start off with? Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and where you come from? As much or as little as you want to say?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: I'm Carmen, I'm originally from Spain, born and raised there and from small southern town \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbella}{Marbella}. So, very different to Manchester.
\end{quote}

And you went to school in Spain?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Yeah, I went to school in Spain. Never moved abroad until I was 18 when I came to University in Manchester.
\end{quote}

So what made you choose computer science as a subject?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: So when I was actually applying for degrees, I didn't know what I wanted to do and it was December and obviously applications closed in January and I had to start writing my personal statement, to a point where the head (teacher), a schoolmaster called me and it was like coming. Where's your personal statement? You need to start applying. And I don't know what I want to do. I knew I liked ICT and art and maths and then he was like, so have you thought about double degree in math and physics? I'm like, no. Physics it's not for me. So, then he said, oh, what about software, engineering, computer science, and I was like, what is that? So back home, it's not really a thing, it's still the idea that technology is what you do in a basement, antisocial. That's the stereotype. So then I was like, sure, let's just go for it. And then I ended up applying for software engineering and that's how I got here.
\end{quote}

That's good advice. I think one of the interesting things is is a lot of decisions people make about what to study at university comes from family, teachers and peers etc and sometimes those people good advice, sometimes they don't give good advice at all!

\begin{quote}
Carmen: I told one of my family members that I was going to study software engineering and they had a full-on go at me, I feel why would I do that? I'm gonna have not a pretty life. I'm gonna be so miserable. I when I came here, realised, that was not gonna be the right thing was gender.
\end{quote}

We'll talk about this later was it perceived as that's not subject for women? Or was that not not on the table?

\begin{quote}
Carmen:: I think at that point it was more, it wasn't one of the core traditional paths back home, more like architect, doctors, teaching.
\end{quote}

Yeah, good. So, can you tell us a bit then about your story. So you arrived here in Manchester and you've been studying. So you actually I suppose fast forward to second year. What happened in second year when you you I think you decided to do a placement from the beginning from the get-go. Was it something? You thought your peers persuaded you? It was a good idea?

\begin{quote}
Definitely the latter. I came into Manchester not knowing what a placement was, but everyone kind of just said, do a placement, do an internship. It's great. So, I kind of got pushed into it changed into that degree. So added that onto my degree, and then started looking for a placement. Second year, was tough time managing that and like, dealing with rejections and all, that is a horny thing to go through. It's very draining very heartbreaking but it's very rewarding at the end
\end{quote}

Time-consuming as well? So how long did it take? How many roughly? How many applications did you do?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: And I was quite lucky that sense. I think I only did about 14 right? Oh with like maybe four of those being emails that sent out to startups because at the beginning, I wanted to go into more startuppy vibes. But then I decided to go through normal job applications, apply to about 10 and obviously you get the bit but the imposter syndrome. When you get all your friends getting applying to the big companies, I didn't want to work for a big company back then. So they obviously get the job opposite first and you feel like you're not good enough or you're not making it but then the offers starts to come in and then it feels a lot nicer.
\end{quote}

And I guess did you have many interviews before? The one you got? Did you have many unsuccessful interviews? Because it's not like an interview for university, some universities don't have interviews at all, so that's a whole new experience in a way, isn't it?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Yes. Absolutely. I remember the first one I did actually was broke company. I didn't really want to apply for, so that was good. But even then, that went absolutely shambles. I we got a tour of the headquarters as well, and the factory. The point at which I was \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining}{mansplained} was very big. I walked out thinking, I don't care if I get the offer because I'm not coming here. So it was a big eye-opening time and then after that I was way pickier with the companies I applied for.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{the-walt-disney-company}{%
\section{The Walt Disney Company}\label{the-walt-disney-company}}

You actually did a placement and internship. Did you which one which way round did you do it?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: I did first my placement, the placement was at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company}{The Walt Disney Company} \citep{carmen2}
\end{quote}

What were you doing? Brief description of what you were doing for Walt Disney.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: So we're just an internal applications kind of improving efficiency of finance and HR teams across the globe.
\end{quote}

And you were in one team for the whole 12 months duration?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Yes for nine months
\end{quote}

And your work I guess you're working with a combination of technical and non-technical people in that role in that year?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Yes, it was mainly technical. It was maybe like one or two that were non-technical but that's about it.
\end{quote}

So on the back of that then you've got did a summer internship after you've done a placement. I guess was getting interviews a little bit easier. Once you have the first thing under your belt

\begin{quote}
getting that first job is definitely the hardest and I feel like doing the summer internship after really helped get the most out of it because having already know how to get to new code base and just get familiar enough to speed as much faster.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{mckinsey}{%
\section{McKinsey}\label{mckinsey}}

The summer internship was at McKinsey? What year was this this? When did the pandemic hit 2020? So you'd started your placement.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Yes. So physically, no, I did it fully, right? You're right, you started remotely. I did my full placement remote and then I realised. That's not something I ever want to do, again, anyone does. And then when I got the office first summer internship, I got the ones. I boiled it down to was one that was remote and what that was in person and I went for the one in person, right? Because I cannot do another six eight weeks of remote and then McKinsey put me in person and we got to travel with the company and that was the best experience ever.
\end{quote}

So that was McKinsey (see figure \ref{fig:mckinsey-fig}). So you were based in London, with different clients I guess?

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/mckinsey}

\begin{quote}
Carmen: So I was put on our US client but to get to the US during COVID you couldn't just get that easily. So we had to do two weeks in Mexico first. So we travelled there. The day before we were meant to leave for the US, Mexico was on the red list. So I had to fly home and then never got to go to the client, but I got two weeks in Mexico. My first in-person job was two weeks in Mexico. I think that was pretty good.
\end{quote}

I hear that Mexican Spanish is very different from Spanish Spanish.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: I couldn't understand the menu when I went to order food. I was like, I don't know any of these
\end{quote}

Someone was telling me the other day, Spanish person telling me that Google Translate when it does translate from English to Spanish, It does English to Latin or Hispanic Spanish rather than European Spanish Spanish. So, Spanish teachers here can always tell when their students are using Google Translate because it comes up with all these weird Latin American sayings and things that you would never say (in Spain).

\begin{quote}
Carmen: That makes so much sense actually. Yeah, no. It's you can really tell the difference. Especially there are a lot more formal than we are probably.
\end{quote}

So you did your summer internship in London and then you came back to Manchester to do your final year?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Yes.
\end{quote}

So you did a project, what was your project?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: It was AI face ageing. So I could I actually use your picture as well for it and I made you look about 50 years old!
\end{quote}

Oh no! Anyway, my face is getting older. So you kind of what you developing algorithms for doing that effectively.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: I used two different models on how to create that image? So that should help like, for example, missing people, that could help the police, it has different applications
\end{quote}

What was that awful Facebook thing, was it face age or something?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceApp}{FaceApp}
\end{quote}

Robbing people's data\ldots{}

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Yes. Actually while it was yeah, using pictures on them the Russian app. Yes, I actually include that my report because yeah, that was one thing we went we obviously shouldn't do. So yeah.
\end{quote}

So, I suppose, one interesting thing is like, how did you find that transition from, so it's all about change, isn't it? You sort of you started as an undergraduate and that's what one change. And then you go to a completely different world of work and that's another change and then you come back to university and it's another change again. So, how did you find that transition back into university?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Going back to uni was a lot better than when I started Uni, because I felt like, when I started uni, I was a lost puppy. I didn't have any software engineering background, I didn't know anything about coding. I didn't know what \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux}{Linux} was. I was completely lost. Starting the job you also still feel a bit of like, what's going on. It's a new company. You're still big loss. Then when I went back to uni, because I already knew what it was like and I felt like during my placement, my confidence actually um, got built up a bit given that I actually managed to put to test my skills and managed to kind of just understand everything that's going on. I felt a bit more confident myself when addressing the courseworks and labs
\end{quote}

And you were a (Peer Assisted Study Sessions)\href{http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk/}{PASS} leader?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: I was PASS leader in second year and past coordinator in third year, right? Okay.
\end{quote}

So I guess that's kind of that's kind of fun. I think. Yes sociable and especially after the pandemic, having everything online.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: I definitely things physically definitely took to an extreme. The fact that in third year they say that yours have a bit more free time and just decided to sign up to as many as extra curriculars as possible and take on a part-time job, which was a bit too much but it was fun and kept you entertained.
\end{quote}

Yeah, good. Okay. So, So what else have we got here? So it's got a questions about challenging things, about your job, what the most challenging things about your work life, would you say in terms of adapting to that and then working? Because working as a software engineer in a university or learning about software engineering university is quite different from actually when we try and simulate the real world and yeah we can do some simulation but there's an awful lot of simulation that can't be done. So what was what was you say was? Most tricky thing about adapting to the real world?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: I think the main thing for me was that I was used to seeing the things, but in a smaller scale and I didn't see it fully applied to the real world. So when I saw it at work or the little things that we had been taught uni kind of come together, it was it took me like maybe a couple months to just kind of put everything together and be like oh this now makes sense or this was taught this way because of this. So on bringing all that knowledge together was definitely a thing.
\end{quote}

And pulling pulling together things not just from one module but I guess from several absolutely also seeing hopefully seeing a bigger picture.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Yes, the it was that combination of everything that really set in
\end{quote}

You finished your exams?

\begin{quote}
Yes. Last week two weeks ago, was it first of June?
\end{quote}

You've had you've been able to enjoy the nice Mediterranean weather we're having!

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Yes it feels like home.
\end{quote}

And, and what comes next? So what what your plans for the future after graduation?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: So I'm still carrying on the part-time job with the startup that I did throughout the year and they've offered me to go back full-time whenever I want basically, but then I also have the return offer from McKinsey, which I would be starting in September. Oh, so currently, I'm, I'm gonna move to London. That's one thing that I know for sure. And then in July, I'm gonna take that as a month of kind of test out what would be like full-time at the startup. Then I'm working for and then once I've done that, decided of, if I'd stay with the startup gift to McKinsey,
\end{quote}

It's good to I suppose have that option of testing it, you don't always have that luxury.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: No, it's actually been very lucky in that sense but I do know that I love travelling and I know with McKinsey it's so client-based. I really enjoy that.
\end{quote}

Although there's less travel these days with consultancies in the, you know, previously you'd spend you'd be like a road warrior, being on the road all the time and now, yeah, you still have to do that face-to-face stuff. But here's a lot of stuff via teams and zoom and whatnot.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Yes. Um, which is also what I was scared about if that would affect anything. So I was speaking with firm themselves and they were like, there's a lot of people that also don't want to travel as well, So they would kind of allocate the clients. Hopefully, I'd be like, yeah, I want to travel so hopefully, I mean that I'd get to be with those clients
\end{quote}

And I think while you're young as well. So while you're young, it's good to travel because you don't have any commitments or have less commitments and you enjoy it. Enjoy that kind of lifestyle while you can because it sometimes becomes harder as you get older. And so, the other thing is, so that was telling us about your story. The other bit is then minority report. So you are a member of minority group. That's grand. As a woman, what's you experience been in the university. I was going to look at the figures, but I think was something around about 25\% of the undergraduate population here (in computer science) are female.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: yes
\end{quote}

So it not a disaster, but could be a whole lot better. That probably reflects what you saw in industry as well?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: I would guess. Yeah, I think slightly less from what I saw
\end{quote}

Right?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: So I'd say it's pretty good in Manchester that we have that. It's definitely a thing that every girl knows every other girl in the degree because when you walk in, kind of it's a bit thing and when it's a girl walking in rather than a guy. I didn't notice it much at first. I didn't think I realised because of the lack of knowledge. I had microaggressions, that actually arise.
\end{quote}

Was it like this at school? Sometimes you find that maths is, I think math is, it varies with countries, but I think in the UK, there are roughly equal numbers of male and female students do maths A-level, I think.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: We had, we were three girls in a class of 10 to 15, right? So, it wasn't that much. And yes, that definitely did have an impact
\end{quote}

And you've done physics as well, I know physics has a similar (problem).

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Yeah, it was like three to ten,
\end{quote}

Right. Okay. So what could the university and employers do, to make campuses and workplaces more welcoming to to women as a profession and as, you know, as students,

\begin{quote}
Carmen: I think for me, it's raising awareness on females and non-females. A lot of people identify people who don't identify female because for those who do identify female, we might receive these comments and we just take them in. We're not good enough or take them personally, whereas actually it has nothing to do with us or like if someone's underestimating my ability it doesn't mean it's because I have to prove them wrong. I have to do this, which is something that I constantly feel like, sometimes it's like, oh, I need to prove them just because I'm a female. But then also with people who don't identify as female to be understand. You can't mansplain real numbers to someone who's that, you know which has happened. And it's like, I'm 22 at University. I think I know what real numbers are. Yeah. Honest.
\end{quote}

But part of the problem is the people mansplaining don't realise. So, that is not (always) malicious. It's just ignorance in a way, I suppose unconscious bias or whatever you want to call it.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Yeah. So we had actually we organised a few women and computer science events in Kilburn with another few students. And it was great because they actually made us more aware of other situations that maybe not, we can now reflect enough. Actually, that was not okay that if someone did that to me, and we've had conversation with people who actually try to mansplain to us like, oh yeah, mansplaining is not good and they'd be like, oh yeah, like I don't
\end{quote}

They're mansplaning mansplaining to you!

\begin{quote}
Carmen: now for they'd be like, oh yeah, I don't understand why anyone would mansplain. And we just be thinking like you've tried to mansplain to us. So it definitely shows how more awareness needs to be raised in that regard.
\end{quote}

The other thing is, making the subject (Computer Science) more appealing to women. There's lots of ideas about how to make it more appealing to women to apply to think about doing at university. Is there anything in the way that the subject is sold? Sold is not right word, in your case it was your head teacher. Who said, this is the thing. But some people look at it and think that's not for me because computer science is just about making lots of money, or it's just about building things that make other people lots of money. So one of the ideas out there is that you make the subject more appealing by showing examples of where it's beneficial to society, rather than just, you know, commercially important. Say for example, I don't know if that would have made a difference?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: I think for me just knowing what it was beforehand, I feel like the lack of exposure was a main thing. I guess this is still that stereotype that yeah, it's just maybe also gaming and not very inviting. So getting rid of that stereotype would definitely be more beneficial for me if I back in the day and
\end{quote}

From an employer point of view, I guess both of your employers would have been welcoming to women, but I guess you have you kind of different problems in the workplace. But what do you think employers could do to make this as profession more appealing or more welcoming to women.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: definitely as well.I guess it just boils back to the raising awareness. Again, I've had work meetings where a developer, I was the only female in that work meeting and male developer asked for everyone's opinion individually on something. Excluding me. So it's just kind of probably raising that way and stuff. Like why what's the need to exclude someone or what's the, why do you need to make comments like that?
\end{quote}

I feel like that's already quite inviting because it's quite difficult for you to call that?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Exactly. Yeah. I guess it's your manager's job. I suppose or whoever's chairing the meeting to say let everyone speak or you haven't asked Carmen for example what exactly and then it rated those uncomfortable situation it's like how do you deal with that? Especially in the workplace, where, you know, you have to be a bit more formal and ethical.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{cotopof}{%
\section{One tune}\label{cotopof}}

To finish up then I've got we've got a few things here. So, and this is one tune, one podcast, One film. Yes. So, we have a playlist that's associated with this podcast, Unfortunately, it's full of lots of dad music because its put together by me. I've been asking students. So, is there a tune that you can use to rejuvenate, or freshen up our playlist? So, it might be something that's important to to you. It might be something, it help a piece of music that helps you relax or might even help you work, or take your mind off work or remind your friends family, and that kind of thing. So, any any one, tune that you would recommend?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: There's one that I've kind of got into lately, which is LOUD by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Carson}{Sofia Carson}, \citep{loud} which is all about. How how women are starting to give a bit more voice and things? And that's making some people not feel uncomfortable. How do you spell? C.A.R.S.O.N. Okay. So that and it's like why should you feel uncomfortable? Now that I actually speak up so I thought found that quite motivational in times where it gets a bit tough.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{one-podcast}{%
\section{One podcast}\label{one-podcast}}

Yeah. Okay good. The one is so one podcast, I mean, you may or may not listen to podcasts?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: There's only one to listen to, one of them is my friends, it's called \textbf{ME time} \citep{metime}. So I used to listen to that on the way to work throughout and it's just about real life, stuff. They speak about how to deal with things that you need had to do things in life. How to grow up as very related with this point in my life.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{one-film}{%
\section{One film}\label{one-film}}

And the last one is one film. It could be something contemporary. Could be something as just out now or that you seem in the last couple of weeks or it could be something older.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: You the last one I've seen is, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She\%27s_the_Man}{She's the Man}. \citep{shestheman} Because a friend mentioned earlier they and it's quite ahead of its time. It's like from 2000 and it's about how the females could also play football, right? And they didn't have to not be allowed on the team because they're a female. (see figure \ref{fig:shes-the-man-fig})

\hypertarget{carmen-time}{%
\section{Advice to your former self}\label{carmen-time}}

Okay good, thank you. So, any closing comments? Advice to your former self. So if you could speak to yourself in first year or to first or perhaps second year student, who is at the beginning of their studies, what would you advise them? I know you've been doing this in your roles are PASS leader. But what one piece of advice would you give them about getting the most out of being at university?

\begin{quote}
Carmen: Definitely getting involved? Because I feel like I took the most advantage of that I could and that was one thing. I know it's hard to not compare yourself to others. I know we constantly do it. And you're doing the labs and you do you may take, you see people who have been coding since they are tiny and they take two minutes to the labs. And we take, I don't have any experience, so I took a bit way longer than that. So, just understand that the fact that they take less time, doesn't mean that they will by the end of the degree. It doesn't mean that they'll land a better job because they've been coding for longer because it's also about the learning stuff.
\end{quote}

Focusing on your also personal best, right? Yes. You know, not the Olympic gold medal standard? Yes. It's just saying, well, am I doing better than I did last time? Absolutely. And it's quite easy to fall in to that trap. I think especially at university where you're surrounded by other people who bright, motivated and hardworking. And if you compare themselves to those, it can lead to mental health problems (see chapter \ref{nurturing}). I think, should we say? I'm not. Absolutely. It's very demotivating.

\begin{quote}
Carmen: So doing that and also balancing it out with the extra-curriculars it gives you also that extra, gives you more. Well, rounded for when you finish.
\end{quote}

Well, thank you for for joining us Carmen. Thank you and we'll see you at graduation.

Carmen: Yes, graduation. Yes.

\section{What's your story Sneha?}\label{sneha-story}}

So, Welcome Sneha, Thank you for coming on the show. Let's start with, tell us a little bit about yourself and where you come from?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: So my name is Sneha, like you said, I've just finished so I'm so excited. Just graduated my bachelor of Science in computer science with a year in industry from the University of Manchester. I'm actually from Manchester, this is my hometown and but originally grew up here.
\end{quote}

You grew up in Manchester?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: since I'm twenty three years old, right? Well, okay. But I was originally born in India but like my whole life has been in Manchester. A little bit about me.
\end{quote}

Good. Okay, so the next question is I'm really interested to find out why why people study computing because there's lots of routes into it as a subject. So what was it that made you think this is something I'd like to spend three or four years at university doing

\begin{quote}
Sneha: so it wasn't something I was always ``oh this is my calling'', you know, this is my this is the field of my choice. I was thinking of various things but I am it may not be as exciting of a story but genuinely just going through that that window. Sorry. Yeah, that's going past carry on. So, it's not as exciting, but that whole going through the education process from like GCSE and then to like a level and then, you know, at that point I I think I had that good firm like but you know that ground that footwork. So that's really helped because, you know, it made that I had that incremental kind of development when it came to the subject and then like obviously I enjoyed don't a bit of computing,
\end{quote}

You did on a GCSE in computing?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: Yes. And A-level as well. Yeah, right. Okay, so I did both That's just because my school offered it I thought you know why not but before I didn't have any like in primary school and nothing but I think that really helped so because like I enjoyed it and then also like you know I did do well in it. I thought you know this is maybe like you know a good and it has obviously good prospect as a field and like another thing I always say is it has that right balance between the creativity and like you know problem solving and trying to get you to use your brain because I like my creative sides. I'm very like, you know, artistic I do a lot of artwork and things. And so this was like, you know, kind of an outlet in some sense as well. And like, that progressive nature of the subject means, like, you know, you start off small and you get bigger and bigger and bigger, and you get feedback as you go through those steps. So I really enjoyed, you know, right? Especially programming, you write a piece of code and then it does something and you kind of see it, you know, quite instantly like, you know, not always but like, quite most of the time usually, see it doing something and that gives you that gratification. So that was probably the reason why
\end{quote}

Good. Okay. You studied computer science in your first year and then at the beginning of the second year you decided to do a placement. Was it something you decided before you came or is it something you decided when you got here? You thought actually I'd like to do a placement?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: So actually, so what happened was I was on the bachelor's, you know, your standard three year bachelor's course. And then I came into the interview day and that's when they introduced what an industrial placement is I never even knew what that meant and they explained what it was to me and I thought hey that actually sounds really useful. So on my interview day after that, I spoke to one of the people there and I said, like do you think I could change? So they told me to just email someone and that's how like I, you know, switched onto it.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{matillion}{%
\section{Matillion}\label{matillion}}

So the beginning of your second year, you started looking for placements or did you have any experience before then, any kind of in? So you going in? I think that's most people. I like that. Yeah.

\begin{quote}
Sneha: Kind of get your second year and it's like, I want to get some experience now.
\end{quote}

So how did you go about choosing somewhere to work? The interesting thing is that different people have different obstacles they face when they find a job. So what were the obstacles you came across and how did you get around them?

\begin{quote}
So, like some obstacles, obviously, finding them . Finding one (where) they like you and you like them as well, obviously there's always that they have to choose you, but you also have to, choose them. So, it's that kind of liking towards the company. So there were companies, I applied for and things, but they, if I had got a placement, it would have just been for the sake of, getting a placement there rather than I actually enjoy, you know, I'd want to work there and I'm like, obviously you have your like challenges of like, you know, the interviews and the coding assessments (see section \ref{codinginterview}) and all of these like things especially for me because I never really did. This is like my first job like ever, like even like, you know, no part-time job previously. So, like this is all fresh new to me. So, just knowing how to navigate that. I made the mistake of not maybe applying to loads, I know loads people who just applied to like a ton. So if I'd go back, I would apply to way more than I did. So, you know, just and also, I'm very timid, so I got really scared and overwhelmed. So actually putting my foot forward to just apply. That was a challenge.
\end{quote}

Jump in the water and see what happens?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: Exactly. That was quite challenging but and also the coding assessments were , obviously you do that throughout, you know, your years of programming, but actually being like, you know, this, you're gonna get a job based on this. It never experienced. That's, that was another challenge.
\end{quote}

Yeah, definitely. So when what was I mean, I guess you, you must have had some unsuccessful interviews\textgreater{}

\begin{quote}
Sneha: Did you know, most people get quite a few rejections.
\end{quote}

Don't they see how you had some rejections? I guess was location of factor. Use of trying to target a particular location. Or will you anywhere in the UK? Or I

\begin{quote}
I genuinely didn't mind. I mean, I I didn't apply outside of the UK. I was all within the UK but I wasn't like like to pick you if it was like Manchester or elsewhere like I didn't mind. Right?
\end{quote}

Okay.

\begin{quote}
Sneha: So the company ended up working for was a Matillion. It's in Manchester's.
\end{quote}

So can you tell us about what Matillion does?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: So Matillion's focus is data transformation. (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load}{Extract, transform, load}) So for cloud data warehouses, so it helps companies transform their data, especially, to move it to the cloud and it provides that kind of like middle kind of software (middleware) that like the product basically helps take the data, you know, extract it from wherever their company may have their data transform it like it allows the company to transform in a way they see fit. And then, you know, we work with like a AWS (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services}{Amazon Web Services}) and Google \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery}{BigQuery} and my \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure}{Microsoft Azure} to like, you know, their day to warehouses, is to keep them all the data there. And I also other products help like analyse data and, like, in the cloud and help, you know, people be able to, like,
\end{quote}

What was your particular role you there?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: I was a so going in as a placement software engineer. So, the good thing was, I wasn't even treated as a placement software engineer. I was just treated as a normal software engineer, in the sense that my work wasn't separate like in, like, oh, you can do this little project on the side. It was very much. You're on the product and you're gonna impact as much as anyone else. Yeah. That's good. To be to be a part of the team. Yeah, not
\end{quote}

not sort of somebody's making cups of tea?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: Exactly.
\end{quote}

So what would you say the main things you learn from your placement?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: You learn a whole lot of stuff at university, using the main things you've got out for your placement work. So like you for like so you have the educational side where that I learnt a lot about you know, software engineering practices because during uni you learn a lot of theory and learn a lot (about) developing your programming skills and everything. But you know in a practical industrial level, you never really see that side until maybe third year. But before that, I never really got that. So actually how the industry works, how a company a software company works that was what was introduced and I thought that was very interesting and, like different that definitely like, you know, it we did the whole software engineering module in year two. It was like kind of applying those principles but it also helped me kind of understand agile practices more which really helped in third year and just how to co-operate with different team members and when you're working on such a big like, you know, this is not just a small repo, it's huge and you're working on a big product, like how that goes, what the process is like, obviously, you can't affect something. So, dangerously. So you, there's a whole protocol and you kind of learn about these things and, you know, what's the most efficient thing for a team. But also on the other side is just like personally I got a lot of communication like, you know, I built that communication a skill and then also just like ownership of the work that I did because I understood, you know, this is gonna impact something bigger than just, maybe like a coursework in like, you know, university. So you have to really put your effort into it and it's more than just something for you. It's something bigger. So, you know, taking responsibility and also the good thing about the company I work for is that they, you know, encouraged even me who's just like a placement, like, and software engineer. It's like, actually coming to meetings. Give my say and like that can actually have an impact on the company. So they, I think that's okay. And I guess a lot of cloud stuff as well because you've done some theory of the cloud stuff, but actually using it using AWS to in using GCP (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform}{Google Cloud Platform}) and things like that to do to do stuff. Yes. Customers in your experience as well. Oh, for sure. So most enjoyable partner.
\end{quote}

Maybe you've covered that already but what was the most enjoyable thing about working. Apart from being paid!

\begin{quote}
Sneha: That was amazing I think. So one thing that kind of was a bit sad for my placement, it was completely remote because of COVID Obviously. Yeah. So placement was just like all like I was just confined to my desk and the people yeah at home and people I met was just like my team and that was about it. But even despite that the social life of the company was like, they were really trying the hardest. So you know that actually did help because everyone is super friendly. I think also because it's not a huge company. Everyone's very homely, everyone just really wants to try and make everyone feel welcome. So I really enjoyed the culture that was the, I think that that's the biggest reason why I like this. Come, I chose the company because the culture was just super like sweet, everyone was nice and they really want to like better. You like you know, help you out. So, you everyone just willing to help no, major big pressure, Obviously, this responsibility, but nothing, you never felt bad about anything and that learning environment. They always encourage you to work. So once every month, they'd encourage us to just stop with our work and just learn something they we had \href{https://www.udemy.com/}{udemy.com} available to us. So I started learning courses on that. So I think it was just the extra things aside from just work.Yeah, that really I made it
\end{quote}

Culture is important I think some people sometimes lose sight of that. It's just kind of just look at the bottom line with how much are they paying?

\begin{quote}
Sneha Yeah.
\end{quote}

And sometimes I think sometimes an interview can be quite hard to work out what the culture is actually like until you actually start there and but it was good to hear you had a good experience of that. So you came back to university, so come back from doing a placement back to university doing your final year project. And so can you tell us a little bit about your final year project? But for our listeners. Can you tell us a little bit about what you to feel?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: Yes, so my final year project was coding their future and my supervisor was you! So, the final year project basically looked into the current state of secondary school, education of computer science and the focus I wanted to take with it was identifying potential problems or issues with the current, state of the education potentially, even the curriculum and then finding actual practical solutions for teaching because currently, the uptake of it is very low. So how can we make that, you know, much better. And so the way that was done, was I worked with a school and a class and trialled different teaching methods, how different materials make create a different materials, used hardware and various other resources to enthuse the students to actually enjoy computer science rather than just have to do it because it's part of the school curriculum
\end{quote}

Yes, did you find going back into school? Because it's very different, isn't it being at the front of the classroom? As opposed to being \emph{in} the classroom as a student. So, how was that? How did you find that?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: it was actually surreal because I actually went back to my high school with my computer science teacher. So, it was really weird that now I'm working with my teacher rather than as a student. So, teaching the students, I think I was slightly like blessed in a sense, because the class were really nice. They were all willing to learn. They weren't super disruptive. Obviously, there were some characters, but, you know, the teacher was there to like, you know, calm down. Do the behaviour control kind of thing. But it was very interesting to see how they responded. And I was actually very surprised to see, like some of the trends, you know, of how they reacted to different things. And, but also because I taught year 9 class, some of them, that's when you choose your options, some of them kind of like, knew coming in, they weren't gonna pick computer science. So they didn't think to try. So that was slightly (a) struggle when you're trying to, you know, get them to do stuff but they don't want to because they know they aren't interested. So that was slightly, you know,
\end{quote}

A bit of a battle.

\begin{quote}
sneha: Yeah.
\end{quote}

Ongoing battle. I suppose?

\begin{quote}
sneha: Yeah
\end{quote}

Good. Okay. So what comes next? So you're graduating next week?

\begin{quote}
sneha: Yes. Next in next Thursday
\end{quote}

What are you planning to do after?

\begin{quote}
sneha: I'm obviously going to have some time off and relax a bit. I'm still going to work at Matillion but I won't be a placement software engineer. So I'll be a graduate software engineer. I'll be continuing to work with the same team on the same product but we're shifting to a different project so I'll be helping on the new project. It's a bit more of my knowledge on this so that's why they decided to keep me on it and also like I do plan on like you know while I'm at the company. I want to learn and they offer like you know, to go and do courses to keep it like agile courses or like AWS courses keep you know in that education field. Long-term wise I do you know, ideally I do want to do a masters in computer science. But I have to see like, you know what, the future holds. But I do want to get further, even further with education.
\end{quote}

I think it's good to sometimes just have a little bit of a break, and I think it takes quite a long time to digest what you've done. It's so intense, especially during COVID as well. You've covered a lot of ground in the last four years and I think it just takes a while for some of those things to sink in and think, what am I doing next what am I interested in?

\begin{quote}
sneha: Exactly
\end{quote}

It's no great, hurry to decide about going into postgraduate and I think sometimes having that experience of working will help you if you do decide to go and do postgraduate study

\begin{quote}
Sneha: that's what I was thinking. If you know, the feel like they value like experience a lot, I thought that would be better. And also you know you I've been studying from like, you know, proper like state school like exams from GCSE like year 10 all the way until now like it's a lot. So I definitely need that break before pursuing even further education.
\end{quote}

Okay, so that's the degree bit your degree, your life in four years would cover that very quickly. There's a few other things to visit here. So they're one of them is minority Report. So you're a emember of a minority group. You're a woman and you're also a British Asian. So I'd been interested in know what your experience have been has been when we've spoken to some people about these things already. But the interesting know what your experiences have been as of that in university and then also in the workplace as well.

\begin{quote}
Sneha: So, with in terms of the university the good thing is, is like it's very diverse. So, for example, all the people that I've talked to especially my friendship group is super diverse in the sense backgrounds. So I have friends, literally from all the different continents you know, it's very diverse. So you see loads of different heritages and people and you learn a lot and we actually talk about these things and they're all different experiences. You're learning from each other which I think, in terms of diversity of like, culture and background. It's definitely like a good place for the university and then but like in terms of maybe of like, you know, as a woman I think I it there is like, kind of a struggle. Sometimes I'd say, in my year, there were quite a few.
\end{quote}

I think, I need to look at the stats but I think it's something around about 25\% of undergraduate students in computer science are women. So you're in a not a tiny minority, but still a minority. So I wonder if there's anything that they're not just this university but all universities can do to make the subject more welcoming or interesting or more desirable to women.

\begin{quote}
Sneha: That was part of my final project was to look at how to introduce, how to demystify, those stereotypes of the subject. you know, encourage females to take up the subject to enjoy the subject. Making it look show, maybe the more creative side, you know, catering to things that women tend to know like, yeah, I think there is that like that, you know, you can kind of tell, it's 25\%, as I mean, if you like, look at like a lecture theatre or like, you'll be start, you know, like this big, yeah, obvious indication and even personally, even though there were likely in a lots of females I could talk to and stuff, most of my friends were male not because like I couldn't make friends with females but because there weren't like as many and, you know, sometimes as, you know, like a few more you want to see like especially, you know, your representation kind of you kind of want to feel a bit more comfortable knowing that you're not just the only one and also you're able to share experiences where because I think that's definitely a big thing you know, you as a woman and you as a male like they're they will be differences. And Ifeel like I could have had a bit more of a more comfortable feeling if I could have more female to relate to. But I know the, you know, especially in computer science, there are like initiatives to get that kind of going. So, you know, I can't say that there's nothing going on. I just think, you know, maybe a little bit more work in that sense. In terms of workplace, I can say that they are definitely trying
\end{quote}

Everyone's trying. Well, \emph{most} people are trying. Anyway. It's a hard problem, isn't it?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: it really is yeah, they try and introduce seminars or they had like a whole weekly meeting talking about, they got like, professional to talk about these things. But like, as much as you know, there is a lot of diversity. I feel like maybe in the engineering department, there's less diversity. Once again, predominantly male and actually, even predominantly, , white males and even more with recruitment to my team, the past three people that have come in, have all been white males and so that I know they are aware. They're recruitment is a little bit, you know, maybe not as diverse, and they're trying to change that. So I do I see that they are trying, but they're obviously things, you like kind of see and like, the reason is like, like the reason why I'd want to get a bit more diverse as a person like, you know, like from a minority group, it's just, you know, these kind of things they do impact your experience computer science or at work, at school. So you kind of want to be able to relate to other people in these experiences. So I think that's why like a super important to be able to see that. But what, in terms of teaching, a lot of the lecturers I do, they will a lot of female lecturers and even my like, supervisor from first and second was a female. So, like it would like, I think in terms of like staff and teaching that was quite good diversity.

\hypertarget{one-tune}{%
\section{One tune}\label{one-tune}}

So the last thing to finish up, well, the last bit to finish up is one one tune one podcast. And one film was the penultimately? Yeah. Is so, um, a piece of music.

There's lots of musical references in this textbook, code in your future. And do you have a piece of music that's important to you that you could add to our playlist? So when I was like reading this, it said it's mostly like, dad, rock. And I this funny thing is is that I'm not really gonna be going far from that.

\begin{quote}
Sneha: The song that I chose was a November Rain by Guns and Roses. \citep{novemberrain}
\end{quote}

Okay, good. Now that's good too good.

\begin{quote}
Sneha: It's very good song. Like the reason I think it was like, super important to me first of all like the, you know, the vibes of the song is very like impactful. Like you got you can listen to it when you're like sad or you can listen to when you like need to get pumped up like and the reason like it means so much to me is is that it's the song that for ages me my sister, my dad on the way to school, we would just listen to this and then on the way back we would listen to this. So it's very reminiscent and so that was the go-to song and then after a while I just like didn't like it's like you know, you kind of just forget about it and then what reminded me was the recent Thor film and that was released thought.
\end{quote}

Love and thunder and it's used on that it was \citep{lovethunder}

\begin{quote}
it was on the soundtrack and like this fight scene and it was just like, it made me feel like all the emotions like, you know, like just kind of gave me that nostalgia and I realised, oh my gosh, this is such a good song.
\end{quote}

So as soon as after that, like me and my sister we put it back on our playlist because we like, you know, just realised like it's such a good song.

\hypertarget{one-podcast-1}{%
\section{One podcast}\label{one-podcast-1}}

Good choice. Okay. So the other thing and is one podcast. I don't know if you listen to podcast but other if there are good podcasts out there that you listen to would you is the one that you recommend?

\begin{quote}
I don't really tend to listen to many. But one podcast I do is rotten mango. \citep{rottenmango} It's very, it's more. Like, if you're into \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime}{true crime} obviously dark topics, but she takes it from a psychological perspective and a legal perspective, all these different things, it's tied in a more lighthearted way.
\end{quote}

Obviously in a more, it's still respectful. But in a very, you know, you're not feeling like groggy and like upset about the things you're listening to. It's very like interesting. So, if you're into that, it's really good. Okay. And then one film, was it gonna be the same film that you would just talk about using a different filter?

\hypertarget{one-film-1}{%
\section{One film}\label{one-film-1}}

I think if anyone asks me this is my film, it's called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Idiots}{3 idiots}, see figure \ref{fig:three-idiots-fig}. \citep{threeidiots} It's a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood}{Bollywood} film, but it's got a lot of global recognition.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/three-idiots} 

}

\caption{3 Idiots is a 2009 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age comedy-drama film written, edited and directed by Rajkumar Hirani and co-written by Abhijat Joshi, with producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra. \citep{threeidiots}}\label{fig:three-idiots-fig}
\end{figure}



So obviously it's in a different language. What sort of is, is it maybe made recently? Or is it? Oh no, it's almost like 2000. I mean not old all the 2009? Yeah, 10 years ago, he's old. So it's the best Like, obviously, because it's in a different language, you may think?

Oh no, like, can't really relate, but it's like generally, it just it crosses culture.

Does it have all the Bollywood dancing and the music?

\begin{quote}
Sneha It was it It is. The story is of like three guys who go through who get into like one of the best engineering schools in India and it deals with the pressures of like you know having to do well and it deals also with like different societal issues, you know, pressures of yourself, precious of your family, maybe like this is not the field.
\end{quote}

You even want to go in or like all of these like very relatable topics that, you know, I feel like students do go through and but it and it deals with like a lot of like deep hard-hitting problems but it does all of that while still also being like the funniest film ever.

So it's like it's got the comedy, the drama. It's got the romance. It's got the suspense. Like, it's got everything. Like, that's why I recommend it strongly. I don't even speak Hindi. So like, I have to watch it with sometimes but still I, I don't watch films like over and over again.

But I watched this one like five for six times. Crazy actually.

\hypertarget{sselfie}{%
\section{Advice to your former self}\label{sselfie}}

I'll make a note of that one definitely. So the last thing to finish up then is I call this time travel. So, if you could travel back in time to meet yourself in the first year, what advice would you give yourself or perhaps current or incoming first, second year, students. What advice would you give them to get the most out of their time at university?

\begin{quote}
Sneha: So I think to two things. So the first one is just putting yourself out there and taking risks because more often than not, it's rewarding. Because even if like it's not your even if you don't get your like intended result, the fact that you've done it and you've tried is better than not knowing if you didn't try so like especially like when I was applying for like placements and stuff completely out of my like, you know what?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Sneha: I know. So I when I did that, you know, obviously after some time, like I did get that reward from it. So just really putting yourself out of your comfort zone. Going to things and I'd say, because obviously with COVID and stuff. Like, you know, it was a bit more difficult but even like socially just like, you know, trying to put yourself out there as an introvert. That's very scary to me. But it's more often than not there's pay off from it. So that's the first piece and then the second one is just hanging in there. You know persevering because to think that my university journey was super smooth sailing is very naive. I remember first year, obviously University of Manchester has really high standards, especially in the computer science department, and that means with such high standards. You kind of doubt yourself, you think maybe this isn't for me and that was definitely something I went through. First year, I was even looking at maybe I should apply for a different course. I think the thing that consolidated, yes, this is your field. This is what, you know, you want to do, was my placement. Yeah, actually,
\end{quote}

Right

\begin{quote}
Sneha: \textbf{After my placement, I knew I actually enjoyed this. I can do for the rest of my life like this. That consolidated it for me.} And so even with struggles and coursework and pressure and eventually those things will finish and those things, you know, you will overcome and then not more often than not. They're not gonna impact your life. You know. Long-term so like is you just kind of have to push through that bit? Yeah, now I'm sitting here about to graduate, so it does pay off just pushing through
\end{quote}

That's good advice. Okay, good. Well, thank you, thank you for joining us today

\begin{quote}
Sneha so much for having me
\end{quote}

we look forward to seeing you at graduation next week.

\begin{quote}
Sneha: Yeah, so exciting. Okay. Thank you.

This chapter lists everything (and I mean \emph{everything}) cited in this book which you might find overwhelming. For a more easily digestible versions see the shorter ``signposts'' section of any chapter in this book and see Gavin Brown's chapter on how to read critically. Critical thinking and critical reading are valuable skills, not just for PhD students and not just for reading scientific papers either.
