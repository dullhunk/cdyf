<p>It‚Äôs all very well <em>designing</em> your future but now you need to actually <em>build</em> and <em>test</em> it. An obvious place to start is with your CV, because that‚Äôs where most people get going. How can you create a bug-free CV, resume or completed application form? How can you support applications with a strong personal statement or covering letter? How can you debug your future? üêõ</p>

<p>Before we get started, let‚Äôs consider some advice from software engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell">Gayle Laakmann McDowell</a> shown in figure <a href="debugging.html#fig:gayle-fig">7.2</a>. Gayle is an experienced software engineer who has worked at the biggest technology employers in the world, Apple, Microsoft and Google. She‚Äôs also authored a cracking series of books on technology careers, particularly <em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-cracking" role="doc-biblioref">McDowell 2015</a>)</span> which we‚Äôll come across in the <a href="interviewing.html">chapter on interviewing</a>. Gayle refers to the employer ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Getting through the doors, unfortunately, seems insurmountable. Hoards of candidates submit resumes each
year, with only a small fraction getting an interview. The online application system ‚Äì or, as it‚Äôs more
appropriately nicknamed, ‚ÄúThe Black Hole,‚Äù ‚Äì is littered with so many resumes that even a top candidate
would struggle to stand out. ‚Äì<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell">Gayle Laakman McDowell</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-blackhole" role="doc-biblioref">McDowell 2011</a>, <a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-techcareer" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you‚Äôre applying to big employers, you‚Äôll need to create a CV that is good enough to stand out before it disappears over the event horizon and into the employment black hole. It needs to be good enough to persuade an employer to invite you to an interview. To get started, you will write this in an employer-agnostic way but you may need to come back and revisit the issues in this chapter once you have identified some target employers, so that you can customise and tailor your CV and written applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="its-not-bug-its-a-feature" class="section level2" number="7.3">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> It‚Äôs not bug, its a feature<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#its-not-bug-its-a-feature"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs an age old trope in Computer Science that engineers use to cover their mistakes, passing off their accidental bugs as deliberate features of their work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a bug, it‚Äôs a feature!‚Äù ‚ÄîA. Hacker <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-bugorfeature" role="doc-biblioref">Carr 2018</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody likes buggy software, but we unfortunately routinely tolerate badly-designed, low quality, bug-ridden software in our everyday lives. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-badsoftware" role="doc-biblioref">Mann 2002</a>; <a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-failware" role="doc-biblioref">Charette 2005</a>)</span></p>
<p>In contrast, buggy CVs are rarely tolerated, they will usually end up in the bin. Even a tiny defect, like an innocent typo, can be <del>fetal</del> fatal. Most employers (particularly large and well known ones) have to triage hundreds or even thousands of CV‚Äôs for any given vacancy. This means they are looking for reasons to REJECT your CV, rather than ACCEPT it, because that‚Äôs a sensible strategy for shortlisting from a huge pool of candidates for interview. A buggy CV, application and covering letter could ruin your chances of being <a href="interviewing.html#interviewing">invited to an interview</a>.</p>

<p>Like writing software, the challenging part of writing a CV isn‚Äôt the <em>creation</em> but in the <em>debugging</em>. Can you identify and fix the bugs before they are fatal?</p>
<!--## Debug their CV {#bugfeature}

It's difficult to be objective about your own CV.-->
<blockquote>
<p>DISCLAIMER: If you ask three people what they think of your CV, you will get three
different and probably contradictory opinions. CV‚Äôs can be very subjective thing. The &gt; advice below is based on common sense, experience and ongoing conversations with
employers. What makes a good CV will depend on the personal
preferences and prejudices of your reader. There are some general rules, which are
described below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While referring to this guide, remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main purpose of your CV is to get an interview, not a job. Your CV should catch attention and provide talking points for an interview but not give your whole life story</li>
<li>Your CV will be assessed in seconds, rather than minutes so brevity really is key</li>
<li>Bullet points with <a href="debugging.html#verbsfirst">verbs first</a> will:
<ul>
<li>allow your reader to quickly scan your CV (<a href="https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/how-people-read/">employers don‚Äôt read CVs, they scan them</a>) <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-scanning" role="doc-biblioref">Richards 2019a</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>highlight your key activities</li>
<li>avoid long sections of prose (which the reader will probably skip anyway)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<p>Wherever criticism of your CV comes from, don‚Äôt take it personally - it is probably one of the first you have written. Think of your current CV as an alpha or beta version that you continuously test, release and redeploy. There are many chances to debug and improve your CV during your study but before potential employers read it. The aim of this chapter is to help you improve your CV, whatever stage you are at. Employers often grumble that Computer Science graduates lack written communication skills. Written applications and CV‚Äôs are a common example of this.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>EDUCATION</strong>: Is your year of graduation, degree program, University and expected (or achieved) degree classification clear? Have you mentioned things you are studying now, not just courses you have finished? See <a href="debugging.html#mycved">Education</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>STYLE</strong>: Does it look good, decent layout, appropriate use of LaTeX or Word or whatever? Are there any spelling mistakes, typos and grammar? Don‚Äôt just rely on a spellchecker, some typos can only be <del>spitted</del> spotted by a human reader</li>
<li>
<strong>LENGTH</strong>: Does it fit comfortably on (ideally) one page (for a R√©sum√©) or two pages (for a CV)? See <a href="debugging.html#length">length</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>STRUCTURE</strong>: Is the structure sensible? Is it in reverse chronological order? Most important (usually recent) things first? Not too many sections or anything missing? See <a href="debugging.html#mycvst">structuring</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>VERBS FIRST</strong>: Have you talked about what you have actually done using prominent <a href="debugging.html#verbsfirst">verbs first</a> in bullets, rather than just what you think you know? Avoid long sections of prose.</li>
<li>
<strong>RESULTS</strong>: Have you also demonstrated and <em>quantified</em> the outcomes of your actions where possible, see <a href="#carstart">Context, Action &amp; Result (CAR)</a>

<p>As Jonathan Black, director of the careers service at the University of Oxford has pointed out,<span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-topnotchcv" role="doc-biblioref">Black 2019</a>)</span> a key part of your story that you want to communicate in your CV is that you :</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>take responsibility</li>
<li>achieve things</li>
<li>are nice to have around</li>
</ol>
<p>How can you demonstrate this? Watch the short video in Figure <a href="debugging.html#fig:black-fig">7.4</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.5.1</span> Your header<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mycvpd"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The first thing in your CV is the header, a simple section giving your name, email, phone number and any links shown in the CV in Figure <a href="debugging.html#fig:turinghead-fig">7.5</a> for Alan Turing. That‚Äôs it!</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span id="fig:turinghead-fig"></span>
<img src="images/alan-turing-header.png" alt="Keep the header of your CV simple. Just your name, email phone number and any relevant links are all you really need. Anything else, will just waste space and distract the reader." width="98%"><p class="caption">
Figure 7.5: Keep the header of your CV simple. Just your name, email phone number and any relevant links are all you really need. Anything else, will just waste space and distract the reader.
</p>
</div>

<p>Your header doesn‚Äôt need to include any more information than your name, email, phone and any links. This means your birth date, marital status, photo and home address aren‚Äôt relevant and you don‚Äôt need to give multiple phone numbers or emails either, just one of each will do. If an employer wants to invite you to an interview, they‚Äôll get in touch by email, phone (or possibly LinkedIn) so other contact details are irrelevant at this point. After <a href="debugging.html#mycvpd">your header</a> I suggest you have five sections that cover the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Education: the formal stuff üéì</li>
<li>Experience: paid work üí∞</li>
<li>Projects: side, social or University projects üí™</li>
<li>Activities and leadership üëë</li>
<li>Awards and honours üèÜ</li>
</ol>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at each of these sections:</p>
</div>
<div id="mycved" class="section level3" number="7.5.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.5.2</span> Your education<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mycved"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Unless you have significant amount of experience, the education section of your CV is likely to be the first real section, after the header. Your education section needs to strike a balance between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describing in enough detail what you‚Äôve studied and any projects you‚Äôve completed at University as part of your formal education</li>
<li>Keeping it short and sweet, without getting bogged down in the details.</li>
</ul>
<p>You‚Äôve invested a significant amount of time and money in getting your degree. At this stage, your degree justifies more description than a terse one line ‚Äú<em>BSc Computer Science</em>.‚Äù You‚Äôll need to say more than <a href="Penelope_Tester.pdf">Pen Tester</a> and <a href="Rick_Urshion.pdf">Rick Urshion</a> (for example) but not as much as <a href="Mike_Rokernel.pdf">Mike Rokernel</a>, who has given <em>way</em> too much information on his degree. You don‚Äôt need to name every single module and give a mark for each. Neither do you need to give two decimal places (it happens). Pick out relevant modules, or the ones you got most out of. Employers like Google encourage applicants to emphasise courses on data structures and algorithms, but you‚Äôll need to tailor your description to the role and be brief. On a one page CV, you might only have two or three lines to describe your higher education.</p>
</div>
<div id="mycvex" class="section level3" number="7.5.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.5.3</span> Your experience<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mycvex"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Experience is where you can talk about any paid or voluntary work experience you have. Don‚Äôt discount casual labour, such as working in retail or hospitality, these demonstrate your work ethic and ability to deal with customers, often under pressure. You are more than just a techie, so anywhere you‚Äôve worked in a team is experience worth mentioning, even if that team was just two people. Two people is still a team.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>If you don‚Äôt have much experience, don‚Äôt worry, there are plenty of opportunities to get some. For details, see <a href="experiencing.html">are you experienced</a>?</p>

<div id="mycvpj" class="section level3" number="7.5.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.5.4</span> Your projects<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mycvpj"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The word ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù is a powerful catch-all description for capturing all other things you get up to. These might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>personal side projects</li>
<li>social responsibility projects</li>
<li>entrepreneurial projects</li>
<li>University projects</li>
</ul>
<p>They will most likely be unpaid because paid work fits better in <a href="debugging.html#mycvex">your experience</a>. Perhaps you‚Äôve completed some courses outside of your education such as a massive open online course (MOOC) or similar. Hackathons and competitions, fit well here too. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-hafb" role="doc-biblioref">Fogarty 2015</a>)</span> You don‚Äôt <em>need</em> to have won any prizes or awards, although be sure to mention them if you have. Participating in hackathons and competitions clearly shows the reader that you enjoy learning new things. Demonstrating an appetite for new knowledge and skills will make your application stand out. If you‚Äôre looking for some inspiration for side projects, Dani Stefanovic‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x">build-your-own-x</a> repository is a good starting point. Building and creating new things is a great way to understand them, just ask <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>. <a href="debugging.html#fig:feynman-fig">7.7</a></p>

<p>Another good source of projects is to <a href="https://dev.to/rose/fixing-a-bug-on-my-open-source-project-from-start-to-finish-1749">fix a bug in an open source project</a>. It might sound trivial, but fixing a bug demonstrates that you can collaborate with others, understand the toolchain being used (which might be complex) and solve problems.</p>
<!-- see open source motivations https://bryanmmathers.com/open-source-motivations/ -->
<p>If you‚Äôve done group projects at University, be sure to mention them. Try to be <em>more</em> descriptive than this:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúFirst year team project‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúSecond year team project‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúFinal year project‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<p>Those project names are pretty opaque and don‚Äôt give the reader much to go on. What was the <a href="debugging.html#carstar">context, action and result (CAR)</a> of the project? How many people were in your team? How long did you collaborate for? What did you build? What was it called? What did it do? What roles and responsibilities did you have in the team? Was their conflict in the team? How did you resolve it? How did you motivate the free-riders in the team to contribute?</p>
<p><strong>This is all excellent CV fodder!</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs often a good idea to describe what YOU did before you describe what the software, hardware or project did. e.g.¬†reversing the order of this list emphasises what YOU did, rather than what the SOFTWARE did</p>
<ul>
<li>WidgetWasher is a web service that takes random widgets and washes them before painting them a random colour and returning them to the client</li>
<li>Tested WidgetWasher on a range of different operating systems and devices</li>
<li>Designed and implemented the API which was build using a RESTful, pair programming with one other collaborator for two days at a hackathon</li>
</ul>
<p>Your reader is likely to be more interested in what YOU did, rather than what the software (or hardware) that you built did. So in this example, I‚Äôd start with the verbs <em>designed</em>, <em>implemented</em>, <em>tested</em> before saying what WidgetWasher</p>

</h3>
<p>You may be tempted to dedicate a whole section on your CV to skills, particularly the technical ones. Maybe it makes you feel good listing them all in one place like a stamp collection. Don‚Äôt do it! Why not? Let‚Äôs imagine, that like <a href="Rick_Urshion.pdf">Rick Urshion</a>, you include Python in a long list skills, with its own dedicated section. There are at least four problems with Rick‚Äôs not so skilful approach:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>No context</strong> to give the reader an idea of the where he‚Äôs developed or used his Python skills. Was it during his education, as a part of his work experience or his personal projects? We don‚Äôt know because he doesn‚Äôt say.</li>
<li>
<strong>No actions</strong> or <em>evidence</em> to back up his claims of having skill with Python. So Rick claims he knows Python. So what? What did he <em>do</em> with those python skills? We don‚Äôt know because he hasn‚Äôt told us. Perhaps he DOES have Python skills, perhaps he DOESN‚ÄôT. Is he telling lies and peddling fake news? It‚Äôs difficult to tell.</li>
<li>
<strong>No results</strong> given for what the outcome of using the skills was. Did he save his employers some money? Did he make something more efficient? Did he learn some methodology? We will never know.</li>
<li>
<strong>No tailoring</strong> the skill to the job that he‚Äôs applying for. Python would be valuable if he was applying to be a data scientist, software engineer, or automated tester but perhaps less relevant for a business analysis, consultancy, user experience or project management roles</li>
<li>
<strong>No story</strong> told for that skill. This makes for a very dull and boring read. Yawn. Next!</li>
</ol>
<p>So, this doesn‚Äôt mean Rick shouldn‚Äôt mention his Python skills. He needs to give us the <a href="debugging.html#carstar">context, action and result (CAR)</a>. This will make his pythonic story much more convincing and interesting to read. Giving the CAR will improve his chances of being invited to interview.</p>
<p>This applies to soft skills too, not just hard technical skills. Best to mention the context in which you‚Äôve used any skills you mention on your CV. So, if you‚Äôre going to have a skill section:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep it short (one or two lines maybe) but don‚Äôt dedicate a whole section to it</li>
<li>stick to your strongest and most relevant skills that you are comfortable to answer questions on in your interview</li>
<li>Microsoft Office is <em>not</em> generally a very interesting skill because everyone has it. Don‚Äôt waste space talking about it unless you‚Äôve done something very advanced with it, like some complicated integration with other software.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you‚Äôre a computer scientist, you also have demonstrable ‚Äúmeta‚Äù skills like the ability to learn things quickly. You can also think logically, reason, problem solve, analyse, generalise, criticise, decompose and abstract - often to tight deadlines. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking">computational thinking</a> skills are future-proof and will last longer than whatever technology happens to be fashionable right now. Employers are often more interested in these ‚Äúmeta‚Äù capabilities and your potential than in any specific technical skills you may or may not have.</p>

<p>Making your CV look good can take ages, but a well presented CV will stand out. While its worth making an effort to style carefully and consisistenly, you need to be be wary of the huge time sink of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography">typography</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever your typographical style is, portable document format (PDF) is the safest way to deliver it. It‚Äôs called portable for a reason. While Microsoft Word is fine for editing, it is difficult to ensure that a Word document doesn‚Äôt get mangled by transmission via the web or email. PDF is much safer, you can be more confident that it will work well on a range of different operating systems and devices. Try opening a Word document on any smartphone or tablet and you‚Äôll see what I mean. It helps if you can give the file a descriptive name so <code>ada_lovelace.pdf</code> is a better filename than <code>my_cv.pdf</code></p>
<p>It‚Äôs fine to author your CV in Microsoft Word, but you‚Äôll want to save as PDF to make it more platform independent. LaTeX and overleaf can be used to create professional PDFs and have many templates, see <a href="https://latex4year1.netlify.app/">Getting started with LaTeX: LaTeX4year1</a> if you‚Äôve not used LaTeX before. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-latex4year1" role="doc-biblioref">Hull 2020</a>)</span></p>

</h3>
<p>One way to structure descriptions of items within each section of your CV is to use <strong>C</strong>ontext, <strong>A</strong>ction and <strong>R</strong>esult (CAR) sometimes called STAR (<strong>S</strong>ituation <strong>T</strong>ask <strong>A</strong>ction <strong>R</strong>esult). This method can also be useful for structuring answers to interview questions, especially if you get nervous. So for example, rather than just listing Python as a skill, you should tell the reader (really spell it out) more about the context in which you‚Äôve used python, what you actually did with it and what the result was</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>CONTEXT</strong>: So you‚Äôve used Python, but in what context? As part of your education? For a personal project? As a volunteer? In a competition?</li>
<li>
<strong>ACTION</strong>: What did you <em>do</em> with Python? Did you use some particular library? Did you integrate or model something?</li>
<li>
<strong>RESULT</strong>: What was the result and how can you measure it? You picked up some knew skills? You made something that was inefficient and awkward into something better, cheaper or faster?</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to CAR and STAR, recruiters at Google (see Figure <a href="debugging.html#fig:lopez-fig">7.3</a>) advise candidates to describe things using ‚ÄúAccomplished [X], as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]‚Äù</p>
<p>So instead of saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Äúgenerated reports for end users.‚Äù -</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúGenerated daily reconciliation report for team by automating workflow of 8 different tasks‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second is better because its more specific, captures the result (accomplishment), by quantifying it ( ‚Äúas measured by‚Äù) and talks about the actions (the doing part).</p>

<p>How long should your CV be? Many people start with a two page CV, which is a sensible starting point. It is also advisable to <a href="https://www.cv-library.co.uk/career-advice/cv/how-long-cv-be/">create a one page Resume</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-howlong" role="doc-biblioref">David 2017</a>)</span></p>

<p>At this stage in your career you should be able to fit everything on to one page. It can be challenging squeezing it all on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIf I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.‚Äù ‚ÄîAnon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It takes more time to write less. Writing a one page resume is a valuable exercise, because it forces you to distill and edit out any filler or fluff, which you sometimes find on two page undergraduate or graduate CVs. It is much better to have a strong one-page resume than a weaker two-page CV that is padded out with filler to make up the space, as described in the video in figure <a href="debugging.html#fig:oneortwopager-fig">7.9</a>. Adding more features (pages and content) to your CV doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it better. Sometimes adding more features to your CV will make it worse, as shown in figure <a href="debugging.html#fig:morefeatures-fig">7.10</a>.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre struggling to fit all the information onto a one page resume, revisit each section and item carefully. Is there anything you can drop? Can you save a wasteful word here, or a lazy line there? Check for any spurious line breaks because every pixel counts. Don‚Äôt throw your two page CV away, its a good store of stuff you might want to add to customised one-page resumes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.6.4</span> Verbs first<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#verbsfirst"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A simple but effective technique for emphasising what you have done, rather than just what you know, is to start the description of it with a verb. Employers don‚Äôt just want to know what you know, but what you have actually done. So, for example, instead of saying e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIn my second year CS29328 software engineering module I used Java, Eclipse and
JUnit to test and build an open source Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you could say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúBuilt and tested a large open-source codebase using Eclipse, Ant, JUnit and Jenkins ‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>followed by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAdded and deployed new features to a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) in Java‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latter examples get to the point much quicker and avoid the problem of using ‚ÄúI, me, my‚Äù too much which can sound self-centred and egotistical. Although your CV is all about you so it is natural to have a few personal pronouns in there, but too many can look clumsy and give the wrong impression.</p>

<p>Augmenting your CV with web links (hyperlinks) adds context, without adding too many words or taking up valuable space as shown in figure <a href="debugging.html#fig:lovelace-fig">7.11</a></p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</p>
</div>

<p>Links are also a great way to add evidence and substantiate any claims that you make. They allow your reader to <em>read between the lines</em> and make inferences from the information you‚Äôve provided them with. For example, you might says things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>‚ÄúBuilt a thing‚Äù</em> reading between the lines: ‚ÄúI like building things. Look at this thing I built just for fun, its really cool‚Äù</li>
<li>
<em>‚ÄúJoined an organisation called bla‚Äù</em> reading between the lines: ‚ÄúI was part a bigger thing you might not have heard about but you can find out about here‚Äù</li>
<li>
<em>‚ÄúCompeted this event called bla‚Äù</em> reading between the lines: ‚ÄúI really enjoy learning from other people by going to hackathons‚Äù</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Links are crucial features of your CV and an interested reader <em>may</em> even follow them. Treat links with respect and they will support your goals and help your readers. Invest some time thinking about how you word the link text, and how they would be understood out of context. Make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>hyperlinks are <a href="https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/content-design/links/">readable and descriptive</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-readable" role="doc-biblioref">Richards 2019b</a>)</span><br>
</li>
<li>hyperlinks are clickable in the PDF. Don‚Äôt make your reader cut and paste (or even type) URLs, they are too busy. If they are clickable, people are much more likely to follow them</li>
<li>hyperlinks are paper-proof. Some people still print CVs so the phrase ‚Äúclick here‚Äù won‚Äôt work well on printed paper. See <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20140620-to-print-or-not-to-print">to print or not to print ‚Äî a CV, that is</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-printcv" role="doc-biblioref">Garone 2014</a>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides LinkedIn you could include public profiles from <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile">github</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@rhamedy/contribution-debt-why-how-to-contribute-to-stack-overflow-a69d4bd50d0c">stackoverflow</a>, <span class="citation">(<a href="reading-your-future.html#ref-stackoverflow" role="doc-biblioref">Hamedy 2019</a>)</span> <a href="https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021734632-Update-your-profile-and-username">devpost</a>, <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard">hackerrank</a>. You can also link to personal projects or your blog if you have one. Obviously, you need to be careful about what you link to and what employers can find out about you online.

<p>It‚Äôs a good idea get feedback from as many different sources as you can on your CV. By <em>sources</em> I don‚Äôt just mean humans, but also robots.

<p>Besides providing feedback on the content of your CV, using these systems can help address issues such as the use of tables or layout which may cause problems for some systems.

</h2>
<p>Applications and CV‚Äôs are often accompanied by covering letters or include some kind of personal statement. Whereas a lot of your CV is essentially a bulleted list of facts and statements, a covering letter or personal statement gives you a chance to <em>really</em> demonstrate your fluent written communication skills in clear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose">prose</a>. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre applying for a widget engineering position at BigWidget Inc.¬†There are three things you need to cover in approximately this order</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Why them?</strong> Why are you applying to BigWidget Inc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Why that role?</strong> BigWidget Inc.¬†employees have many roles and responsibilities, so what is it about widget engineering that attracts you?</li>
<li>
<strong>Why you?</strong> Why should they employ you? What makes you stand out from all the other widget engineering candidates? What is your Unique Selling Point (USP) or points?</li>

<span class="header-section-number">7.9.1</span> Does anyone actually READ covering letters?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#elevatorpitch"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Some employers will read them very carefully, some less so. It‚Äôs not clear which employers will bother and which won‚Äôt.</p>
<p>Even if nobody reads your covering letter, it is still worth writing one because it forces you to rehearse standard interview questions shown above. See e.g.¬†<a href="https://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/cl/">www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/cl/</a> for further information.
