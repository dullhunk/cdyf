<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 12</span> Moving your future</h1>
<p>Finding a job often involves moving to a new location or even a different country. So a simple way to improve your job prospects is to broaden your job search (chapter <a href="finding.html#finding">11</a>) and consider all the alternatives, geographically and otherwise. Some of the alternative options are outlined in chapter <a href="choosing.html#choosing">6</a>. This chapter looks at some UK alternatives to London.</p>

<p>Your future is bright, your future needs moving, so let’s start moving your future.</p>
<div id="south" class="section level2" number="12.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> Hit the South?</h2>
<p>For example, if you’re seeking work or further study in the United Kingdom, there are lots of possibilities in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxbridge">Loxbridge</a> (<strong>Lo</strong>ndon, <strong>Ox</strong>ford and Cam<strong>bridge</strong>). While Loxbridge undoubtedly offers many fantastic opportunities for your professional growth and development, it does not represent <em>all</em> of the best opportunities that exist in the UK see figure <a href="moving.html#fig:northern-fig">12.1</a>.</p>
<!--LOxbridge is a fortified triangular castle bound London and its two most significant suburbs, Oxford and Cambridge.-->
</div>
<div id="north" class="section level2" number="12.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.2</span> Hit the North!</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for a job in the UK you don’t have to exclusively target the South (London) to find top employers, there are plenty located in the North too: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_the_North">Hit the North</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-hitthenorth">M. E. Smith, Smith, and Rogers 1987</a>)</span></p>
<div class="rmdcaution">
<p><strong>Looking for Northern jobs in the UK?</strong></p>
<p>See a partial list of tech employers at <strong><a href="https://git.io/manc">git.io/manc</a></strong></p>
<!--This list of is currently being migrated from [dullhunk/book](https://github.com/dullhunk/book) to [dullhunk/cdyf](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf) - in the meantime, see the list at git.io/manc)-->
</div>
<p>Northerners have often argued that Northern England offers a better quality of life than London we couldn’t possibly comment other than to say its horses for courses. The North West Tech Community calendar, provides a window on (and networking opportunities with) many of employers based in the North West <a href="https://technw.uk">technw.uk</a> if you want to find out more. As Sharon Dale once said: its NotJustLondon <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-notjustlondon">Dale 2018</a>)</span></p>
<p>So, it’s wrong to assume that capital cities like London are where <em>all</em> the best opportunities are. That’s true in the UK and also in many other countries too, and the rise of working from home during the pandemic has changed our relationship with cities. You might need to consider moving your future.</p>
<p>This is a partial list of employers in the North West of England (aka the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Powerhouse">Northern Powerhouse</a>) that recruit Computer Science students. This is not a comprehensive list of all tech companies in the North West, but will give you a quick flavour of employers in the Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Northern England.</p>
</div>
<div id="eastwest" class="section level2" number="12.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.3</span> Hit the East and West</h2>
<p>It’s not just the North or the South either: You should also hit the East and the West too, don’t just look at big cities. Don’t just look at big employers. Look beyond the obvious, chapter <a href="choosing.html#choosing">6</a> may help broaden your job search horizons.</p>
<p>In addition to these <a href="https://www.techuk.org">techuk.org</a> and <a href="https://technation.io">technation.io</a> provide more information on technology businesses outside of London.</p>
</div>
<div id="tldr16" class="section level2" number="12.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.4</span> Summarising moving your future</h2>
<p>Too long, didn’t read (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_long;_didn%27t_read">TL;DR</a>)? Here’s a summary:</p>
<p>Your future is bright, your future might mean you moving to a new place. Moving your future, could help you test your future. Testing your future, will help you to start coding your future.</p>
<p>The best jobs are not always in the obvious places. The myth that all the best graduate jobs are in London (or Paris, Berlin, Silly Valley etc) is clearly not the case, see figure <a href="moving.html#fig:uuk-fig">12.2</a>.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:uuk-fig"></span>
<img src="images/uuk.jpeg" alt="It’s a myth that all the best graduate jobs are in London and other capital cities or centres for technical innovation like Silicon Valley, Silicon Alley or Silicon Fen. For some more misleading myths see the universitiesuk.ac.uk report on Busting Graduate Job Myths introduced in section 1.6. (Ball 2022)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 12.2: It’s a myth that all the best graduate jobs are in London and other capital cities or centres for technical innovation like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Alley">Silicon Alley</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Fen">Silicon Fen</a>. For some more misleading myths see the <a href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/">universitiesuk.ac.uk</a> report on <em><a href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/what-we-do/policy-and-research/publications/busting-graduate-job-myths">Busting Graduate Job Myths</a></em> introduced in section <a href="rebooting.html#entitled">1.6</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-ballmyths">Ball 2022</a>)</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>So a simple way to broaden your future and open up more possibilities is to consider all the geographical options. Move your future by looking beyond the obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the North!</li>
<li>Hit the South!</li>
<li>Hit the East!</li>
<li>Hit the West!</li>
</ul>
<p>Having debugged your CV, and worked out which employers to apply to, in the next part, chapter <a href="speaking.html#speaking">13</a>: <em>Speaking your Future</em> we’ll look at preparing for interviews which will test your spoken communication skills.</p>
<p>You’ve used the techniques in <em>testing your future</em> to get an interview, now you need to get ready to demonstrate that you are a good communicator, not just in writing but in listening and speaking too.</p>
