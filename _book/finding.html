<p>The marketplace for job searching and job hunting advice is incredibly crowded. Employers spend huge amounts of money recruiting staff and this is reflected in the enormous range of job websites, which are often accompanied by advice on job hunting. I’ve broken resources down here into three categories:</p>
<div id="student-and-graduate-specific-resources" class="section level3" number="8.2.1">

<p>These resources are specifically aimed at undergraduate students and graduates:</p>

<p>Google job search aggregates content from many (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44853472">but not all</a>) of the sources listed above. You can use google job search use to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven’t used it already try the searches below. Unlike other sites, Google job search works by indexing embedded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)">microdata</a> based on <a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting">schema.org/JobPosting</a>. Keywords like <strong>job</strong>, <strong>intern</strong> or <strong>placement</strong> in a vanilla google search will trigger the job search product:</p>

<span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Job search strategies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#job-search-strategies"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>It is a good idea to have a range of different strategies for job hunting, and change the strategy during the year. Before we look at strategies, it’s important to realise that when you’re reading job descriptions for vacancies, some employers will over state their requirements in the hope they get their dream candidate. You might look at the job description and think, I’ve only got 70% of what they’re asking for, so I won’t bother applying. The truth is, if you’ve got 75% of what they are asking for, you should definitely apply.</p>
<div id="over-specified-jobs" class="section level3" number="8.3.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.3.1</span> Over specified jobs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#over-specified-jobs"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Employers and recruiters routinely over-specify job descriptions. A good example of this is, when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift programming language</a> was released in 2014 at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference">Apple Worldwide Developers Conference</a> (WWDC), job adverts instantly appeared asking for programmers with “5 years experience in Swift!” How can anyone have five years experience in a programming language that’s only just been made public? Aside from the people who developed the language, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner">Chris Lattner</a>, the employers are going to have long searching trying to find their candidate.</p>

<p>Your close network probably won’t change that much, the friends and family you trust and rely on. Its important to recognise the importance of more casual acquaintances, or what sociologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter">Mark Granovetter</a> calls “weak ties.” <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-granovetter" role="doc-biblioref">Granovetter 1973</a>)</span></p>

<p>Weak ties are people you don’t know as well, but are important for a range of reasons. Research has shown that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-why-your-weak-tie-friendships-may-mean-more-than-you-think">building networks of weak ties is good for your mental health and can give you an edge in job hunting</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-weakties" role="doc-biblioref">Leslie 2020</a>)</span> Granovetter showed that many job opportunities came through weak ties, rather than strong ones. This is true not just of jobs early on in your career (like now) but also later too. So it is in your interests to foster weak connections and be open to serendipitous meetings where you bump into people, as in Figure <a href="finding.html#fig:bumped-fig">8.2</a>. “Bumping into” here, could mean either physical or virtual.</p>

Academics have careers too, and some will have extensive networks of contacts in industry and academia that might be useful to you. If you ask nicely, they might introduce you to people they know who can help, such as former students or collaborators.
