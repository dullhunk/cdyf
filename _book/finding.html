<p>So, you’ve successfully debugged your CV, with help from chapters <a href="debugging#debugging">8</a>, <a href="hacking#hacking">9</a> and <a href="verbalising#verbalising">10</a>. You’ve reflected on who you are in chapter <a href="exploring#exploring">2</a> and identified where you can improve your <code>experience</code> as described in chapter <a href="experiencing#experiencing">5</a>. Now, how can you find an interesting job? How can use your CV, covering letter and any other (mostly written) communication to persuade employers to invite you to an interview? What techniques exist and how can you use your networks to help you? Where can you look? This chapter will help you find your future. 🔭</p>

</h2>
<p>Before we look at where to look for jobs, we need to discuss what to look for. Let’s imagine there is a handy AI-powered function in python called <code>find_jobs()</code> which knows <em>everything</em> about:</p>
<ul>
<li>all the jobs available, regardless of where they are advertised, including hidden ones (see Jonathan’s story of finding hidden jobs in chapter <a href="jonathan#jonathan">34</a>)</li>
<li>all of your skills, knowledge, values and ambitions</li>
<li>every employer in the world, their services, products and values</li>
<li>everyone in your social and professional networks, right from first degree connections through to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">sixth degree connections</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-bacon">Bacon 1994</a>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a function doesn’t really exist yet, but let’s pretend that it does to illustrate some points about job searching. If you were to run the function with no arguments…</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/6f3a98ca6ae2cdcb611f8b4838fe25df.js"></script><p>…you will be completely overwhelmed with the results. It can be bewildering knowing where to start your job search, because the possibilities are endless. Your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_space">search space</a> is <strong>HUGE</strong>! It’s like trying to drink from a high-pressure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_hose">fire hose</a>, see figure <a href="finding#fig:firehose-fig">11.2</a>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we can break it down, but there are many parameters and variables in your search that you need to think about. Here are some basic strategies to help you start to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decompose</a> the complex problem of job hunting into smaller, more manageable problems you can start to tackle. We’ve already mentioned some:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>👨‍🔬 search by role, see section <a href="finding#by-role">11.2.1</a>
</li>
<li>📊 search by sector, see section <a href="finding#by-sector">11.2.2</a>
</li>
<li>💪 search by skills, see section <a href="finding#by-skills">11.2.3</a>
</li>
<li>🌍 search by location, see section <a href="finding#by-location">11.2.4</a>
</li>
<li>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 search by network, see section <a href="finding#weakties">11.2.5</a>
</li>
<li>💰 search by salary, see section <a href="finding#by-salary">11.2.6</a>
</li>
<li>🏋️ search by size, see section <a href="finding#by-size">11.2.7</a>
</li>
<li>❤️ search by values, see section <a href="finding#by-values">11.2.8</a>
</li>
<li>🕰 search by timing, see section <a href="finding#by-time">11.2.9</a>
</li>
<li>⚖️ search by quantity, see section <a href="finding#by-quantity">11.2.10</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each strategy has is own strengths and weaknesses, so you’ll probably want to combine more than one and experiment with different strategies as your search progresses over time. No doubt, you’ll have some extra strategies of your own, this is not meant to be an exhaustive list, just a starting point:</p>
<div id="by-role" class="section level3" number="11.2.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.2.1</span> Search by role<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#by-role"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There are many different roles that studying computing gives you access to besides software engineering. So one strategy is to research the roles described in section <a href="choosing#otheroles">6.3</a>, focus on some you like the sound of and then apply for those kinds of roles. Let’s say you are interested in <code>software engineering</code>. This is a strategy that will help you narrow down a huge number of jobs into something more manageable. For example:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/c13ddb4dbd5c43220cd35caa5d1f40c7.js"></script><p>The list of roles in section <a href="choosing#otheroles">6.3</a> will give you a flavour of some roles to think about, beyond software engineering.</p>
</div>
<div id="by-sector" class="section level3" number="11.2.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.2.2</span> Search by sector<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#by-sector"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Computing is found in every sector of business and society. This means you won’t just find computing jobs in the technology sector. Although the lines between some sectors are becoming increasingly blurred, you can still narrow down your options by picking a sector you are interested in and pursuing that. For example:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/ecc64065d98a45b54ed178f370af6abf.js"></script><p>Like many graduate employment guides, the Guardian 300 guide (see section <a href="finding#studentjobs">11.3.1</a>) has good overview of employers broken down by sectors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consulting</li>
<li>Public sector</li>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Picking a sector can help you get started, by narrowing what is otherwise a <em>massive</em> search space. The sector(s) you choose will also determine the kind of salary you can expect, see section <a href="finding#by-salary">11.2.6</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve got the brains, you’ve got the looks, let’s make lots of money. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-letsmakelotsofmoney">Tennant and Lowe 1986</a>)</span></p>
</div>
<div id="by-skills" class="section level3" number="11.2.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.2.3</span> Search by skills<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#by-skills"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Is there a specific skill you have that you enjoy using, or a technology you think has a promising future? You could use this as a way to find jobs, for example:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/61bf8c20b4eb2da9a168ebb29b7026fd.js"></script><p>Picking a specific technology can sometimes help you narrow down the options, for example by using these keywords in your search.</p>
</div>
<div id="by-location" class="section level3" number="11.2.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.2.4</span> Search by location<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#by-location"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>If you were an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_agent">estate agent</a>, you might argue that the three most important parameters of your job search are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Location <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-location">Allsopp and Spencer 2000</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>Location <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-location">Allsopp and Spencer 2000</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>Location <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-location">Allsopp and Spencer 2000</a>)</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So pick a location: Manchester? London? Paris? Berlin? New York? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">Silly Valley</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work">WFH</a>? The location(s) you choose will determine the options that are available:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/5004cbf5fc337fb8e7357e62c50d15eb.js"></script><p>… and so on. So locations can help you define (and potentially reduce) your search space. For example, if you’re looking in Manchester, you can get started at <a href="https://git.io/manc">git.io/manc</a>. Picking a location can also help you identify networking opportunities for hidden, un-advertised vacancies and making speculative applications, described in section <a href="finding#speculative">11.3.4</a>. You could find out about employers by attending free <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> or <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/">eventbrite.com</a> events in your chosen location. See section <a href="jonathan#jonetwork">34.3</a> of Jonathan’s story in chapter <a href="jonathan#jonathan">34</a>. Since its a big subject, there’s more information on searching by location in chapter <a href="moving#moving">12</a>.</p>

<p>The people in your network can help you find work. <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it%27s_not_what_you_know_but_who_you_know">It’s not what you know, its who you know</a></em>, or so the cliché goes. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-newfads">Spearpoint et al. 1992</a>)</span> The bigger your network, the more opportunities you’ll know about. So a really basic strategy for finding jobs is using your networks. Remember, our <code>find_jobs</code> does just know what you know, it also knows who is in your professional <code>network</code> and the employers <em>they</em> know about, so we could ask it to find opportunities in your professional and social networks:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dullhunk/c2e05b55e55c285de8525a6952731f30.js"></script><p>Your close network probably won’t change that much, the friends and family you trust and rely on. Its important to recognise the importance of more casual acquaintances, or what sociologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter">Mark Granovetter</a> calls “weak ties”. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-granovetter">Granovetter 1973</a>)</span></p>

<p>Weak ties are people you don’t know as well, but are important for a range of reasons. Research has shown that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-why-your-weak-tie-friendships-may-mean-more-than-you-think">building networks of weak ties is good for your mental health and can give you an edge in job hunting</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-weakties">Leslie 2020</a>)</span> Granovetter showed that many job opportunities came through weak ties, rather than strong ones. This is true not just of jobs early on in your career (like now) but also later too. So it is in your interests to continually foster weak connections and be open to serendipitous meetings where you bump into people, as in Figure <a href="finding#fig:bumped-fig">11.3</a>. “Bumping into” here, could mean either physical or virtual.</p>

<p>Besides balancing the books and keeping the cash flowing, what does a given employer actually value? How do an employers values match your own, the <code>values_match</code> below? Reasonably or not at all? How much of your soul do you need to sell? All of it, or just some of it? This a difficult question to compute, see section <a href="choosing#soul">6.5</a>, but let’s imagine we can:</p>

Would you enjoy working there and would you felt like you belonged? What are the organisational values, both in theory and in practice? Do you need to sell your soul in order to join? How can you actually find this out? If you’re struggling with these questions, the following should be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>check an employers reputation online using glassdoor and other tools described in section <a href="finding#generaljobs">11.3.2</a>
</li>
<li>talk to individual employees because online reviews have well known limitations. This is why networking (virtual and actual) is important, see section <a href="finding#weakties">11.2.5</a>

<p>For graduates and undergraduates, the time of year you are looking can determine what jobs you can look for. At the beginning of the academic year in September you might target large multinational organisations. If you don’t find what you want, you could switch to smaller employers later in the academic year. For example “It’s October, so I’m applying to large employers” or:</p>

<p>Figure <a href="finding#fig:blunderbuss-fig">11.7</a> shows two extreme approaches to job hunting, in reality you’ll probably want to strike a balance between <em>quality</em> and <em>quantity</em>. Finding jobs by quantity can set a pace and rhythm to your job search:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb40-1"><a href="finding#cb40-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>“I will do one application per week during term time”</span></code></pre></div>
<p>or set a time limit for what you’re prepared to do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb41"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb41-1"><a href="finding#cb41-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>“I'll spend two hours per week finding and applying for jobs”</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you find yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making a small number of applications, you may need to consider applying more widely and spending <em>less time</em> on each application</li>
<li>Making a large number of applications, you may need to consider applying less and spending <em>more time</em> on each application</li>
</ul>
<p>This raises the question, how big is a <em>small</em> or a <em>large</em> number of job applications, which isn’t easy to answer. Doing fifty applications over a couple of months may mean the quality of each application is too low.</p>

<p>The marketplace for job searching and job hunting advice is <em>incredibly</em> overcrowded. Employers spend huge amounts of money on recruitment and this is reflected in the enormous range of jobs boards, which are often accompanied by advice on job hunting. There are five basic kinds of places you can look for jobs:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>🎓 Undergraduate and graduate jobs boards, such as <a href="https://www.gradcracker.com">gradcracker.com</a> and your University jobs board e.g. <a href="https://careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk">CareerConnect</a> etc see <a href="finding#studentjobs">11.3.1</a>

<p>Google job search is a good starting point because it crawls and indexes lots of different jobs boards. It doesn’t index <em>everything</em>, see <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44853472">Google’s job hunting service comes to UK</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-noindeed">Kelion 2018</a>)</span>, but its a pretty good place to start.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Google job search indexes jobs advertised by many of the resources mentioned in this chapter. You can use google job search to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven’t used it already try the searches below. Unlike other services, Google job search works by indexing embedded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)">microdata</a> structured using <a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting">schema.org/JobPosting</a>. Keywords like <code>job</code> and <code>internship</code> in an ordinary (vanilla) google search will trigger the job search product, as shown in the following examples:</p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester">google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester</a></p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern">google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern</a></p>

<p>-Google job search is an impressive product, see <a href="https://grow.google/job-seekers">grow.google/job-seekers</a> but it doesn’t index <em>everything</em>.

<span class="header-section-number">11.3.3</span> Pushing a public professional profile<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#portfolio"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Jobs boards use the <strong>pull</strong> approach to job hunting, you search for and pull vacancies of interest. Alongside this, you can also try a <strong>push</strong> approach by publishing a professional public profile online.</p>
<p>Publishing a portfolio of your work online will allow employers and recruiters to come and find you, as well as you searching for them. Employers shouldn’t expect you to have an online portfolio and you might not want to have one, but it can help. If you choose to have a public profile, you can link to it in the header of your CV, see section <a href="debugging#header">8.7.1</a>.</p>

<p>So, if you’re happy to publish your work online, services like LinkedIn, Github and Stackoverflow can help you find jobs using a <em>push</em> approach alongside more conventional <em>pull</em> approaches described in section <a href="finding#studentjobs">11.3.1</a> and <a href="finding#generaljobs">11.3.2</a>. They can also be used to augument your CV, with the stuff that doesn’t fit onto one or two printed pages.

<p>Some job vacancies are not advertised. Employers may deliberately hide them or make them difficult to find so they aren’t swamped with lots of unsuitable applicants. Smaller employers do not always offer the kinds of experience described in section <a href="experiencing#areuexperienced">5.3</a>. In these cases, a speculative application might the only way to get a foot in the door, see figure <a href="finding#fig:gambling-fig">11.14</a>. In popular sectors which can be harder to break into like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game">video games</a>, a speculative application is worth considering alongside getting a recruiter to help you, described in section <a href="finding#recruiters">11.3.5</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>To improve your chances of winning the bets placed in your speculative applications you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do some research about the employer, see section <a href="speaking#bp10">13.3</a>
</li>
<li>Make sure you’ve debugged your CV or résumé, see section <a href="debugging#checklist">8.10</a>
</li>
<li>Have written a compelling and personalised covering letter, see section <a href="debugging#covering-letters">8.14</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your speculative application might take several different forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>traditional CV and covering letter, by email see section <a href="debugging#covering-letters">8.14</a>
</li>
<li>Phone call, these can work well with smaller employers, have your (verbal) “elevator pitch” ready see section <a href="debugging#covering-letters">8.14</a>
</li>
<li>Digital or virtual approach, eg. via LinkedIn or similar see section <a href="finding#portfolio">11.3.3</a>
</li>
<li>Speaking to employers in person e.g. at networking or other public events <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life">IRL</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever form your speculative application takes, the networks that we described in section <a href="finding#weakties">11.2.5</a> can be useful in approaching employers including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>virtual</strong>: people you’ve met online, for example in places like those described in section <a href="finding#portfolio">11.3.3</a><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>actual</strong>: people you’ve met in real-time face to face, offline and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life#Related_terminology">IRL</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>professional</strong> contacts: employers who have visited your University or you know via some other means</li>
<li>
<strong>personal</strong> contacts: friends, family, fellow students etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Making speculative applications may involve you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_calling">cold calling</a> employers, by email, phone or online. It’s a bit of a gamble, but it can sometimes work. The people in your networks can help you to make job applications that aren’t completely cold.</p>
<p>Smaller employers are more likely to be receptive to speculative job applications than larger employers. While speculative applications are a gamble, sometimes they will pay off.</p>

<div id="recruiters" class="section level3" number="11.3.5">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.3.5</span> What about recruiters?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recruiters"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Recruiters can help you find work and they operate in every industry sector. They are sometimes called “head-hunters”, and there are two basic kinds that can help you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Recruiters employed directly by an employer, for example in the human resources (HR) department of a given organisation.</li>
<li>Recruiters who are self-employed or work for a recruitment agency. They typically earn money from the number of interview candidates and successful hires they provide for their clients. They are often deliberately coy about who their clients are.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recruiters are usually not technical people, so don’t expect them to any knowledge of software engineering (for example) - that isn’t usually their skill set. Although recruiters can help you, it is worth being wary of recruiters as shown in figure <a href="finding#fig:recruiter-fig">11.15</a>, especially if they work for an agency rather than being directly employed by the organisation you are interested in.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:recruiter-fig"></span>
<img src="images/recruiters-are.png" alt="The autocomplete algorithm of a well known search engine gives you an idea of what some people think about some recruiters. This doesn’t mean you should avoid recruiters completely, just be careful how you use their services and pay close attention to who they work for." width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 11.15: The autocomplete algorithm of a well known search engine gives you an idea of what <em>some</em> people think about <em>some</em> recruiters. This doesn’t mean you should avoid recruiters completely, just be careful how you use their services and pay close attention to who they work for.
</p>
</div>

<p>Some recruiters are very good and can help you, especially if they work direclty for the employer you are interested. There are some recruitment agencies that specialise in helping employers recruit graduates, these may be useful to you. Others specialise in particular sectors such as <a href="https://www.aswift.com/">aswift.com</a> who focus on video game development. Some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_search">executive search</a> firms specialise in fields where employers struggle to find suitable candidates, such as computing.</p>
<p>However some recruiters are not very good, and don’t always provide a valued service for employers or potential employees like you. This is why you sometimes see <code>no recruiters</code> or <code>no agencies</code> on job adverts. So be wary of recruiters, and remember that some recruiters work primarily for their clients (employers) not you.</p>
<p>In most cases you shouldn’t have to pay recruiters up front but job scammers will sometimes pose as recruiters so beware. Talking of job scammers, there’s some more things you need to be wary of when you are job hunting:</p>

<p>Despite their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americentrism">Americentric</a> approach, these articles raise important points. Many of them claim that while hiring is broken, they’ve got a solution to fix it. There’s no escaping the fact that the personnel an organisation chooses to hire is one of the most important decisions it can make. Consequently, hiring the <em>wrong</em> people can lead to all sorts of (expensive) problems. Unfortunately, it seems likely that important decisions on hiring will remain complicated, time consuming and error-prone.</p>
<p>So beware of broken recruitment practices. Hiring is broken, don’t hold your breath waiting for it to be fixed. Recruitment can be biased, bureaucratic, discriminatory, labour intensive, expensive, inefficient and painful for many people. It can be unfair and doesn’t always select the best candidates for the post anyway. Hiring is not just unncessarily unpleasant for you, it’s the same for employers too. Knowing this will help you prepare for its many limitations and be patient. Stay on the bus.</p>
<p>So, if you’re finding your job hunt unpleasant, you are not alone. Many recruitment practices are flawed but they are probably the “least worst” system we have, at least for now. 🤕</p>

<p>Employers and recruiters routinely over-specify job descriptions, see figure <a href="finding#fig:impossible-fig">11.20</a>. A good example of this is, when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift programming language</a> was first publicly released in 2014 at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference">Apple Worldwide Developers Conference</a> (WWDC) in California, job adverts instantly appeared asking for programmers with <code>5 years experience in Swift</code>! How can <em>anyone</em> have five years experience in a programming language that’s only just been made public?! Aside from the people who developed the language, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner">Chris Lattner</a>, the recruiters and employers must have had a <em>long</em> search trying to find their candidate. It must have taken them at least five years!</p>

<p>The moral of this Apple story above is, if you don’t meet <em>all</em> the criteria in a job specification, that shouldn’t stop you applying. Most job adverts are over-specified as wishful employers dream up their ideal candidate.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Using a relationship analogy, describe your ideal romantic partner. PAUSE. How many people are actually likely to have ALL of those attributes?&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>31</sup></a> Many employers will overstate their requirements in the hope they get their dream candidate. You might look at the job description and think, <em>I’ve only got 70% of what they’re asking for, so I won’t bother applying</em>. The reality is, if you’ve got 60% of what they are asking for, you should probably apply. It’s unlikely that <em>anyone</em> will meet 100% of the job requirements.</p>
<p>If you see things on job adverts you don’t understand or are not sure about, go and find out about them. There’s a good chance it will be similar to something you already know about, or you can self-educate yourself to fill any gaps. But beware of employers over-specifying jobs. 🤣</p>

<p>In the UK, it is illegal to employ people without paying them a salary. However, there are exceptions which can allow employers to take on unpaid interns depending on how they classify their interns employment status. See for example:</p>

<p>In science, technology and engineering, unpaid internships are much less common than in other sectors as demand for skilled scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics">STEM</a>) is generally high. Some employers, particularly startups, may offer company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)">equity</a> (such as shares) as an alternative to a salary - again you should be wary of this. Unless you’re very lucky, the chances are those shares will probably be worthless. Although many startups aspire to become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">Unicorns</a>, very few do. Like many people, I don’t endorse unpaid internships, and I recommend you avoid them completely, see section <a href="finding#by-salary">11.2.6</a> and figure <a href="finding#fig:slavery-fig">11.21</a>.</p>

<p>An unpaid internship might <em>claim</em> to be giving you:</p>
<ul>
<li>some “experience” or “exposure”</li>
<li>equity-for-work</li>
<li>something impressive for your CV</li>
<li>opportunities to “build up your portfolio”</li>
<li>improved access to paid employment at some vague (but unspecified) point the future</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, in the worst case, taking an unpaid internship leaves you vulnerable to exploitation by ruthless employers looking for cheap or free labour. There are campaigns to ban them. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-BanUnpaidInternships">Alcazar and Schmit 2023</a>)</span> Unpaid internships have been likened to modern slavery, see figure <a href="finding#fig:slavery-fig">11.21</a>, so I recommend you avoid them. 😭</p>
<p>There is <em>one</em> exception to this: expenses paid work-shadowing for a short period of time (two or three weeks) such as spring insights described in section <a href="experiencing#areuexperienced">5.3</a>. Otherwise, if you can’t find paid employment, doing voluntary work for a charity or non-profit is a much safer bet and has mental health and social benefits too, see section <a href="experiencing#areuexperienced">5.3</a>.</p>

<p>There’s two kinds of fake news that are common in the jobs marketplace:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Employers overselling themselves</strong>: Recruitment can be a bit of a beauty contest, with employers trying to show you their best side. Some employers may make promises they can’t deliver but a quick look on services like <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com">glassdoor.com</a> will help you evaluate employers. Even better, talk directly with actual employees of the organisation, both current and former. Is their employer really as good as they say they are?</li>
<li>
<strong>Candidates exaggerating their achievements</strong>: It can be tempting to oversell yourself in the marketplace. An experienced reader or interviewer will be able to spot your fake news and find you out, see chapter <a href="debugging#debugging">8</a> <em>debugging your future</em>

<p>Likewise, you should make sure you don’t undersell yourself. Know your value (financial), know your values (see chapter <a href="exploring#exploring">2</a>) and try to understand how that fits with a given employer. What are the employers stated values? When it comes to financial value, it is easy to find out about salaries, for example see:</p>

</ul>
<p>Salaries in the UK for interns (and graduates) range from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage">minimum wage</a> to £50k and over, with everything in between. So beware of under-selling yourself, know your value, see <a href="finding#by-salary">11.2.6</a>. Some employers see students as a form of cheap labour that can be exploited because you’re not “qualified” until you graduate. I’d think twice before working for such an employer, computing skills are in demand and there are plenty of other employers who will treat you with more respect. 📉</p>

<p>You can spend ages carefully crafting your job applications. After all your hard work, you click <code>submit</code> and you don’t hear anything back other than an automated acknowledgement. There is no human-in-the-loop who will bother say <code>NO</code>. How can employers be so rude! Are your job applications being sucked into employers black holes? The forcefield of many employers is so strong that once you send our CV or job application, it is never seen again. Not even light can escape from the human resources (HR) departments of some employers because the gravitational forces of attraction between potential employees (like you) and employers (like them) is so strong that they are overwhelmed with applications.</p>
<p>For most people, this kind of rejection or “ghosting” is a normal part of applying for jobs, see for example, Amish’s story in chapter <a href="amish#amish">28</a>.</p>
<p>Welcome to the employer <strong>black hole</strong> we met in section <a href="debugging#blackhole">8.2</a> and illustrated in figure <a href="finding#fig:blackhole-fig">11.26</a>.</p>

<p>What can you do about it? If you’re getting too many rejections or all your applications are sucked into black holes, it might be because you need to :</p>
<ul>
<li>debug your CV and job applications (again), see section <a href="debugging#checklist">8.10</a>, <a href="debugging#cvswap">8.11</a> and <a href="debugging#triangulation">8.12</a>
</li>
<li>refine and/or broaden your job search strategy, see section <a href="finding#strategies">11.2</a> and chapter <a href="choosing#choosing">6</a>
</li>
<li>get some more <code>EXPERIENCE</code>, <code>PROJECTS</code> and <code>SKILLS</code> to help your applications stand out more in the future. Look beyond paid work as a way to enhance your CV and LinkedIn, see chapter <a href="experiencing#experiencing">5</a>
</li>
<li>reflect on which skills are missing from your CV, see chapter <a href="verbalising#verbalising">10</a>. What could you do to show employers you are developing these skills?</li>
<li>revisit your design for your future. Do you know yourself as well as you think? Are you expressing that clearly in your job applications? Are you explaining to employers what value you’d add to their team? Know thyself, see chapter <a href="exploring#exploring">2</a>
</li>
<li>get a referral if you can, for competitive employers a referral from somebody you know inside the organisation can help you bypass the early stages of selection. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-jobreferrals">CPeth 2024</a>)</span> This is where networking helps, so keep growing your networks, both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life">IRL</a> and online. Its not not just <em>what</em> you know, but <em>who</em> you know, see section <a href="finding#weakties">11.2.5</a>. Even if you can’t get a referral, you may get useful insights from current employees that will give you an advantage in the job application process.</li>
<li>pay close attention to your mental health, if you’re not already doing so. Repeated rejections can make you anxious and depressed, see chapter <a href="nurturing#nurturing">3</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So beware of rejection when your applications are sucked into employers black holes, try not to take it personally. Beware of rejection, it is (unfortunately) a normal part of job hunting. 🤮</p>

<!--
It is no secret that, when applying for placements and graduate jobs, you are likely to submit multiple applications before being offered a role. In response to rejections, students are often encouraged to ‘be resilient’ and ‘keep trying’ – but there’s a lot more to it than that.

While it’s important to bounce back from rejection and keep applying to opportunities, churning out one application after another in the name of resilience isn’t always productive. It is more important that you are taking steps to minimise rejection and increase your chances of success. And there are several ways that you can do this.

Don’t take a scattergun approach

You are more likely to be successful sending out five targeted, tailored applications than twenty untailored applications for roles you do not meet all the requirements for. So, my first piece of advice is to create targeted applications for opportunities you have a reasonable chance of getting (i.e. you meet all the necessary criteria).

You’ll need to tailor each application to the employer and the role, detailing why you are interested in the opportunity and giving examples of what makes you the best person for the job. This will ensure that the applications you do send out are of a high quality.

Learn from feedback

If you’re unsuccessful at interview, make use of any feedback to identify areas for improvement. It’s important that you are self-critical and that you don’t take rejection personally. Acknowledge what you did well and improve on what you could have done better, so that your next application has a greater chance of success.

Create a schedule

Set yourself a reasonable target for the number of applications you are going to submit each week. It’s important that this target is realistic for you, so be sure to factor in your other responsibilities and priorities.

Designating a specific time to work on your applications should help you stay focused and motivated. It’s also likely to safeguard against burnout; in other words, it’ll stop you from overworking yourself, which doesn’t usually do much for the quality of your work.

Moreover, working to a schedule means you’ll have ongoing applications at different stages. If you receive a rejection from one application, you’re likely to have others in progress, which should help you stay motivated and remain optimistic.

Keep an open mind

Try to think laterally when choosing which opportunities to apply for. It can be tempting to apply to companies which you are already familiar with, and while there are lots of advantages of working for large, well-known organisations, there are just as many benefits to working for medium-sized companies and SMEs that you perhaps might not have heard of.

By considering the full range of companies on Gradcracker, you open yourself up to more opportunities, and more chances of success.

Equally, don’t just go for the opportunities that are directly related to your degree discipline. As a STEM student, your transferable skills make you highly sought after in a diverse range of sectors and roles, so try to keep an open mind when searching for opportunities.

Now, it’s time to try again!
I hope these steps help you to bounce back from rejection – but also to prevent rejection and increase your chances of success.-->
