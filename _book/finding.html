<p>The marketplace for job searching and job hunting advice is incredibly crowded. Employers spend huge amounts of money on recruitment and this is reflected in the enormous range of job websites, which are often accompanied by advice on job hunting. I’ve broken resources down here into three categories, student specific, more general resources and recruiters.</p>
<div id="studentjobs" class="section level3" number="8.2.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.2.1</span> Student and graduate specific resources<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#studentjobs"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The following job finding resources are specifically aimed at undergraduate students and graduates:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<p>The following job finding tools are aimed at a wider audience (not just students and graduates) but will be useful to you nonetheless.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:googlejobs-fig"></span>

<p>Google job search shown in figure <a href="finding.html#fig:googlejobs-fig">8.2</a> is a good starting point. It doesn’t index <em>every</em> job listings site, see <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44853472">Google’s job hunting service comes to UK</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-noindeed" role="doc-biblioref">Kelion 2018</a>)</span>, but its a pretty good place to start.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Google job search indexes jobs advertised by many of the resources mentioned in this chapter. You can use google job search use to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven’t used it already try the searches below. Unlike other sites, Google job search works by indexing embedded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)">microdata</a> structured with <a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting">schema.org/JobPosting</a>. Keywords like <code>job</code> and <code>intern</code> in an ordinary (vanilla) google search will trigger the job search product, some examples:</p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester">google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester</a></p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern">google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern</a></p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer">google.com/search?q=graduate+hardware+engineer</a></p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london">google.com/search?q=graduate+software+job+london</a></p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=data+scientist+intern">google.com/search?q=data+scientist+intern</a></p>
<p>-Google job search is an impressive product, see <a href="https://grow.google/job-seekers">grow.google/job-seekers</a> but it doesn’t index <em>everything</em>. If you’re looking for a job AT google, they have moved from <a href="https://jobs.google.com/about/">jobs.google.com</a> to <a href="https://careers.google.com/">careers.google.com</a>, see also section <a href="experiencing.html#bignames">5.3.1</a></p>

<span class="header-section-number">8.2.3</span> Recruiters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recruiters"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Recruiters can help you find work and they operate in every industry sector. They are sometimes called “head-hunters,” and there are two basic kinds that can help you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Recruiters employed directly by an employer, for example in the human resources (HR) department of a given organisation.</li>
<li>Recruiters who are self-employed or work for a recruitment agency. They typically earn money from the number of interview candidates and successful hires they provide for their clients.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recruiters are usually not technical people, so don’t expect them to have lots of knowledge about software engineering (for example) - that isn’t usually their skill set. Although recruiters can help you, it is worth being wary of recruiters as shown in figure <a href="finding.html#fig:recruiter-fig">8.4</a>, especially if they work for an agency rather than being directly employed by the organisation you are interested in.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:recruiter-fig"></span>
<img src="images/recruiters-are.png" alt="The autocomplete algorithm of a well known search engine gives you an idea of what some people think about some recruiters. This doesn’t mean you should avoid recruiters completely, just be careful how you use them and remember who they work for." width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 8.4: The autocomplete algorithm of a well known search engine gives you an idea of what <em>some</em> people think about <em>some</em> recruiters. This doesn’t mean you should avoid recruiters completely, just be careful how you use them and remember who they work for.
</p>
</div>

<p>Some recruiters are very good and can help you. For example, there are some recruitment agencies that specialise in helping employers recruit graduates, these may be useful to you. However some recruiters are not very good, and don’t provide a valued service for employers or potential employees like you. This is why you sometimes see <code>no recruiters</code> or <code>no agencies</code> on job adverts. So be wary of recruiters, and remember that some recruiters work primarily for their clients (employers) not you.</p>
<p>In most cases you shouldn’t have to pay recruiters up front but job scammers will sometimes pose as recruiters so beware. Talking of job scammers, there’s some things you need to be wary of when you are job hunting:</p>

<p>Most job adverts are legitimate but you are vulnerable when you are job hunting. You may become more vulnerable over time if you are getting repeated rejections (remember: repeated rejection is quite normal). Unfortunately there are some shady characters out there looking to exploit your vulnerability through various kinds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_fraud">employment fraud</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-jobscammers" role="doc-biblioref">Hinds 2017</a>)</span> You should be wary of anyone asking you for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money up front - be very suspicious</li>
<li>Excessive personal data such birth dates, passport numbers and bank details. These could be used for identity theft, fraud or other criminal activities</li>
<li>See for example <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=job+scams">google.com/search?q=job+scams</a>

<p>Reputable employers (and jobs boards) will not try to scam you, but you should beware of job scammers if you find yourself looking for employment off the beaten track.</p>

<p>Employers and recruiters routinely over-specify job descriptions. A good example of this is, when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift programming language</a> was released in 2014 at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference">Apple Worldwide Developers Conference</a> (WWDC) in California, job adverts instantly appeared asking for programmers with <code>5 years experience in Swift</code>! How can <em>anyone</em> have five years experience in a programming language that’s only just been made public?! Aside from the people who developed the language, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner">Chris Lattner</a>, the recruiters and employers must have had a <em>long</em> search trying to find their candidate. It must have taken them at least five years!</p>

<p>The moral of this Apple story above is, if you don’t meet <em>all</em> the criteria in a job specification, that shouldn’t stop you applying. Most job specifications are over-specified as wishful employers dream up their ideal candidate.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Using a relationship analogy, describe your ideal romantic partner. PAUSE. How many people are actually likely to have ALL of those attributes?&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> Many employers will over state their requirements in the hope they get their dream candidate. You might look at the job description and think, I’ve only got 70% of what they’re asking for, so I won’t bother applying. The reality is, if you’ve got 60% of what they are asking for, you should definitely apply. It’s unlikely that <em>anyone</em> will meet 100% of the job requirements.</p>
<p>If you see things on job adverts you don’t understand or are not sure about, go and find out about them. There’s a good chance it will be similar to something you already know about, or can self-educate yourself to fill any gaps.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">8.3.3</span> Beware of unpaid internships<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#unpaid"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In the United Kingdom, it is illegal to employ people without paying them a salary. However, there are exceptions which can allow employers to take on unpaid interns depending on how they classify their employment status. See for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employment rights and pay for interns <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns">gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns</a>

</li>
<li>For more horror stories see <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships">google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In science, technology and engineering, unpaid internships are much less common than in other sectors as demand for skilled engineers and scientists is generally high. Some employers, particularly startups, may offer company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)">equity</a> (such as shares) as an alternative to a salary - again you should be wary of this. Unless you’re very lucky, the chances are those shares will probably be worthless. Like many people, I don’t endorse unpaid internships, and I recommend you avoid them completely. They are a form of modern slavery.</p>

<p>There’s two kinds of fake news that are common in the jobs marketplace:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Employers overselling themselves. Recruitment can be a bit of a beauty contest, with everyone trying to show you their best side. Some employers may make promises they can’t deliver but a quick look on sites like <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com">glassdoor.com</a> will help you evaluate employers. Even better, talk directly with actual employees of the organisation, both current and former. Is their employer really as good as they say they are?</li>
<li>You exaggerate your achievements: It can be tempting to oversell yourself in the marketplace. An experienced reader or interviewer will be able to spot your fake news and find you out, see chapter <a href="debugging.html#debugging">7</a> <em>debugging your future</em>

<p>Likewise, you should make sure you don’t undersell yourself. Know your value (financial), know your values (see chapter are <a href="knowing.html#knowing">2</a>) and try to understand how that fits with a given employer. What are the employers stated values? On the financial side, it is easy to find out about salaries, for example see:</p>

<p>Salaries in the UK for interns (and graduates) range from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage">minimum wage</a> to £50k and over, with everything in between. So beware of under-selling yourself, know your value. Some employers see students as a form of cheap labour that can be exploited because you’re not “qualified” until you graduate. I’d think twice before working for such an employer, computing skills are in demand and there are plenty of other employers who will treat with more respect.</p>

<p>One way to tackle this problem is to schedule some time every week when you work on applications, see chapter <a href="scheduling.html#scheduling">19</a>. However, there’s no getting away from the fact that finding a job will be time consuming. Beware of the time sink.</p>

<p>For most people, rejection is a normal part of applying for jobs. Rejection can take a heavy toll on your mental health described in chapter <a href="nurturing.html#nurturing">3</a> and it is usually a struggle. Some employers won’t even bother to reply to reject you, welcome to the employer black hole described in section <a href="debugging.html#blackhole">7.2</a> and shown in figure <a href="finding.html#fig:blackhole-fig">8.7</a>.</p>

<li>develop a better job search strategy (see this chapter, chapter <a href="finding.html#finding">8</a>)</li>

<p>Weak ties are people you don’t know as well, but are important for a range of reasons. Research has shown that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-why-your-weak-tie-friendships-may-mean-more-than-you-think">building networks of weak ties is good for your mental health and can give you an edge in job hunting</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-weakties" role="doc-biblioref">Leslie 2020</a>)</span> Granovetter showed that many job opportunities came through weak ties, rather than strong ones. This is true not just of jobs early on in your career (like now) but also later too. So it is in your interests to continually foster weak connections and be open to serendipitous meetings where you bump into people, as in Figure <a href="finding.html#fig:bumped-fig">8.10</a>. “Bumping into” here, could mean either physical or virtual.</p>

It is no secret that, when applying for placements and graduate jobs, you are likely to submit multiple applications before being offered a role. In response to rejections, students are often encouraged to ‘be resilient’ and ‘keep trying’ – but there’s a lot more to it than that.

While it’s important to bounce back from rejection and keep applying to opportunities, churning out one application after another in the name of resilience isn’t always productive. It is more important that you are taking steps to minimise rejection and increase your chances of success. And there are several ways that you can do this.

Don’t take a scattergun approach

You are more likely to be successful sending out five targeted, tailored applications than twenty untailored applications for roles you do not meet all the requirements for. So, my first piece of advice is to create targeted applications for opportunities you have a reasonable chance of getting (i.e. you meet all the necessary criteria).

You’ll need to tailor each application to the employer and the role, detailing why you are interested in the opportunity and giving examples of what makes you the best person for the job. This will ensure that the applications you do send out are of a high quality.

Learn from feedback

If you’re unsuccessful at interview, make use of any feedback to identify areas for improvement. It’s important that you are self-critical and that you don’t take rejection personally. Acknowledge what you did well and improve on what you could have done better, so that your next application has a greater chance of success.

Create a schedule

Set yourself a reasonable target for the number of applications you are going to submit each week. It’s important that this target is realistic for you, so be sure to factor in your other responsibilities and priorities.

Designating a specific time to work on your applications should help you stay focused and motivated. It’s also likely to safeguard against burnout; in other words, it’ll stop you from overworking yourself, which doesn’t usually do much for the quality of your work.

Moreover, working to a schedule means you’ll have ongoing applications at different stages. If you receive a rejection from one application, you’re likely to have others in progress, which should help you stay motivated and remain optimistic.

Keep an open mind

Try to think laterally when choosing which opportunities to apply for. It can be tempting to apply to companies which you are already familiar with, and while there are lots of advantages of working for large, well-known organisations, there are just as many benefits to working for medium-sized companies and SMEs that you perhaps might not have heard of.

By considering the full range of companies on Gradcracker, you open yourself up to more opportunities, and more chances of success.

Equally, don’t just go for the opportunities that are directly related to your degree discipline. As a STEM student, your transferable skills make you highly sought after in a diverse range of sectors and roles, so try to keep an open mind when searching for opportunities.

Now, it’s time to try again!
I hope these steps help you to bounce back from rejection – but also to prevent rejection and increase your chances of success.-->
