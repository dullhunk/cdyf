<p>The marketplace for job searching and job hunting advice is incredibly crowded. Employers spend huge amounts of money on recruitment and this is reflected in the enormous range of job websites, which are often accompanied by advice on job hunting. I’ve broken resources down here into three categories, student specific, more general resources and recruiters. Before we look at those, we need to define some terms.</p>
<div id="jobterms" class="section level3" number="8.2.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.2.1</span> Job terminology<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#jobterms"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>Employers use terms to describe jobs for undergraduates and graduates inconsistently. In this book we use the following terms shown in Table <a href="finding.html#tab:jobterms">8.1</a>.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve defined terms for jobs we can look at resources for finding them.</p>

<p>These following job finding resources are aimed at a wider audience (not just students and graduates) but are useful nonetheless.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Google job search indexes jobs advertised by many (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44853472">but not all</a>) of the resources mentioned in this chapter. You can use google job search use to find internships, placements and graduate jobs anywhere in the world, as well as saving vacancies and setting up job alert notifications by email. If you haven’t used it already try the searches below. Unlike other sites, Google job search works by indexing embedded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)">microdata</a> based on <a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting">schema.org/JobPosting</a>. Keywords like <code>job</code>, <code>intern</code> and <code>placement</code> in an regular google search will trigger the job search product:</p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester">google.com/search?q=software+engineering+intern+manchester</a></p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern">google.com/search?q=business+analyst+intern</a></p>

<span class="header-section-number">8.2.4</span> Recruiters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recruiters"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Recruiters can help you find work and they operate in every industry sector. They are sometimes called “head-hunters,” and there are two basic kinds that can help you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Recruiters employed directly by an employer, for example in the human resources (HR) department of a given organisation.</li>
<li>Recruiters who are self-employed or work for a recruitment agency. They typically earn money from the number of interview candidates and successful hires they provide for their clients.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recruiters are usually not technical people, so don’t expect them to have lots of knowledge about software engineering (for example) - that isn’t usually their skill set. Although recruiters can help you, it is worth being wary of recruiters as shown in figure <a href="finding.html#fig:recruiter-fig">8.2</a>, especially if they work for an agency rather than being directly employed by the organisation you are interested in.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="images/recruiters-are.png" alt="The autocomplete algorithm of a well known search engine gives you an idea of what some people think about some recruiters. This doesn’t mean you should avoid recruiters, just be careful how you use them." width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 8.2: The autocomplete algorithm of a well known search engine gives you an idea of what <em>some</em> people think about <em>some</em> recruiters. This doesn’t mean you should avoid recruiters, just be careful how you use them.
</p>
</div>

<p>Some recruiters are very good and can help you. For example, there are some recruitment agencies that specialise in helping employers recruit graduates, these may be useful to you. However some recruiters are not very good, and don’t provide a valued service for employers or potential employees like you. This is why you sometimes see <code>no recruiters</code> or <code>no agencies</code> on job adverts. So be wary of recruiters, and remember that some recruiters work primarily for their clients (employers) not you.</p>
<p>In most cases you shouldn’t have to pay recruiters up front but job scammers will sometimes pose as recruiters so beware. Talking of job scammers, there’s some things you need to be wary of when you are job hunting:</p>

<p>When you’re looking for job you’re acting as both a buyer <em>and</em> a seller.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>SELLING</strong>: You’re selling your services in a marketplace, for the best price you can get</li>

<p>Most job adverts are legitimate but you are vulnerable when you are job hunting. You may become more vulnerable over time if you are getting repeated rejections (remember: repeated rejection is quite normal). Unfortunately there are some shady characters out there looking to exploit your vulnerability through various kinds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_fraud">employment fraud</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-jobscammers" role="doc-biblioref">Hinds 2017</a>)</span> You should be wary of anyone asking you for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money up front - be very suspicious</li>
<li>Excessive personal data such birth dates, passport numbers and bank details. These could be used for identity theft, fraud or other criminal activities</li>

<p>Employers and recruiters routinely over-specify job descriptions. A good example of this is, when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift programming language</a> was released in 2014 at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference">Apple Worldwide Developers Conference</a> (WWDC) in California, job adverts instantly appeared asking for programmers with <code>5 years experience in Swift</code>! How can <em>anyone</em> have five years experience in a programming language that’s only just been made public?! Aside from the people who developed the language, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner">Chris Lattner</a>, the recruiters and employers must have had a <em>long</em> search trying to find their candidate. It must have taken them at least five years!</p>

<p>The moral of this Apple story above is, if you don’t meet <em>all</em> the criteria in a job specification, that shouldn’t stop you applying. Most job specifications are over-specified as wishful employers dream up their ideal candidate.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Using a relationship analogy, describe your ideal romantic partner. PAUSE. How many people are actually likely to have ALL of those attributes?&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> Many employers will over state their requirements in the hope they get their dream candidate. You might look at the job description and think, I’ve only got 70% of what they’re asking for, so I won’t bother applying. The reality is, if you’ve got 60% of what they are asking for, you should definitely apply. It’s unlikely that <em>anyone</em> will meet 100% of the job requirements.</p>
<p>If you see things on job adverts you don’t understand or are not sure about, go and find out about them. There’s a good chance it will be similar to something you already know about, or can self-educate yourself to fill any gaps.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">8.3.3</span> Beware of unpaid internships<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#unpaid"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In the United Kingdom, it is illegal to employ people without paying them a salary. However, there are exceptions which can allow employers to take on unpaid interns depending on how they classify their employment status. See for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employment rights and pay for interns <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns">gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns</a>
</li>
<li>Targetjobs position on <a href="https://targetjobs.co.uk/internships/advice/275017-the-law-on-unpaid-internships-know-your-rights">the law on unpaid internships: know your rights</a>
</li>
<li>RateMyPlacement article: <a href="https://www.ratemyplacement.co.uk/blog/why-i-regret-doing-an-unpaid-internship/">Why I Regret Doing an Unpaid Internship</a>
</li>
<li>For more horror stories see <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships">google.com/search?q=unpaid+internships</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In science, technology and engineering, unpaid internships are much less common than in other sectors as demand for skilled engineers and scientists is generally high. Some employers, particularly startups, may offer company equity (e.g. shares) as an alternative to a salary - again you should be wary of this. Like many people, I don’t endorse unpaid internships, and I recommend you avoid them completely. They are a form of modern slavery.</p>

<p>When people try to sell you things, you should be wary of overselling and fake news shown in figure <a href="finding.html#fig:fakenews-fig">8.3</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>There’s two kinds of overselling that are common in the jobs marketplace:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Employers overselling themselves. Recruitment can be a beauty contest, with everyone trying to show you their best side. Some employers may make promises they can’t deliver but a quick look on sites like <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com">glassdoor.com</a> will help you evaluate employers. Even better, talk directly with actual employees of the organisation, both current and former. Is their employer really as good as they say they are?</li>
<li>You exaggerate your achievements: It can be tempting to overstate your case to sell your services in the marketplace. An experienced reader or interviewer will be able to spot your fake news and find you out, see chapter <a href="debugging.html#debugging">7</a> <em>debugging your future</em>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should be wary of both. Likewise, you should make sure you don’t undersell yourself. Know your value (financial), know who you are and try to understand how that fits with a given employer. It is easy to find out about salaries, for example see <a href="https://github.com/IgWod/interns-salaries-uk-2018">technical intern salaries in the UK</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-igwod" role="doc-biblioref">Wodiany 2018</a>)</span> and <a href="https://luminate.prospects.ac.uk/graduate-salaries-in-the-uk">graduate salaries in the UK</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-michaelgrove" role="doc-biblioref">Grove 2018</a>)</span> Salaries in the UK for interns range from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage">minimum wage</a> to £50k, with everything in between.</p>

<p>Now that you’re aware of some pitfalls you need to think about developing a range of different strategies for job hunting, and change the strategy during the year.

<p>Your close network probably won’t change that much, the friends and family you trust and rely on. Its important to recognise the importance of more casual acquaintances, or what sociologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Granovetter">Mark Granovetter</a> calls “weak ties.” <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-granovetter" role="doc-biblioref">Granovetter 1973</a>)</span></p>

<p>Weak ties are people you don’t know as well, but are important for a range of reasons. Research has shown that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200701-why-your-weak-tie-friendships-may-mean-more-than-you-think">building networks of weak ties is good for your mental health and can give you an edge in job hunting</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-weakties" role="doc-biblioref">Leslie 2020</a>)</span> Granovetter showed that many job opportunities came through weak ties, rather than strong ones. This is true not just of jobs early on in your career (like now) but also later too. So it is in your interests to continually foster weak connections and be open to serendipitous meetings where you bump into people, as in Figure <a href="finding.html#fig:bumped-fig">8.4</a>. “Bumping into” here, could mean either physical or virtual.</p>
