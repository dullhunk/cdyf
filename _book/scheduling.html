<p>You might find it a bit scary thinking about your future. You might be tempted to procrastinate making important decisions as you head into the great unknown<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;that is the world of employment, in case you are wondering&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a>, see figure <a href="scheduling.html#fig:schedule-fig">18.1</a>. There is a risk of getting stuck in a <code>do-nothing</code> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting">busy waiting</a> loop. This guidebook and the live <em>Coding your Future</em> (COMP2CARS) sessions are here to help you break out of that loop.</p>
<p>The live sessions will be back in September 2021, see <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/">manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates</a>. In the meantime see the <em>Wednesday Waggle</em> at <a href="https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk</a></p>

<div id="cameras" class="section level2" number="18.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">18.1</span> Cameras on or off?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cameras"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I would normally expect participants in small meetings (not large ones like lectures) to turn their cameras on but I understand that there are good reasons why people may not be willing/able to and won’t explicitly ask you to.</p>
<div id="why-turn-cameras-on" class="section level3" number="18.1.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">18.1.1</span> Why turn cameras on?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-turn-cameras-on"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There has always been a question around whether to turn cameras on during online meetings but it is even more obvious with online meetings becoming the norm rather than the exception. I see a direct benefit in using cameras in small, personal meetings where many of us make use of visual cues to aid the flow of conversation – at the very least it’s easier to identify who is talking. Additionally, it can help people get along – people might feel more ‘listened to’ if they can see somebody listening and personally I find it easier to remember names etc if I have a face to match the names to. I will generally have my camera on and will continue to keep it on even if I am the only one.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-not" class="section level3" number="18.1.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">18.1.2</span> Why not?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-not"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There are lots of reasons why not. Most obviously, if you don’t have access to a camera. But you may also be in an environment which you prefer others not to see, you may have anxiety around the issue, or your connection might be too slow. There are many other perfectly reasonable reasons for you not to put your camera on and you should not feel pressured to do this. If you simply say “Sorry, I can’t turn my camera on today” then I won’t ask any further and I will never explicitly ask you to turn it on.</p>
</div>
<div id="being-appropriate" class="section level3" number="18.1.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">18.1.3</span> Being appropriate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#being-appropriate"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>You should already be treating online meetings like physical ones e.g. turning up on time, being prepared, listening, engaging etc. Similarly, if people can see you then you should ensure you are wearing appropriate clothes (wearing clothes is the absolute minimum here!) and in an appropriate place (the bathroom is probably not appropriate) as you would for a physical meeting.</p>
</div>
<div id="respecting-others" class="section level3" number="18.1.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">18.1.4</span> Respecting others<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#respecting-others"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>If other people have decided to turn their cameras on then I ask that you show them respect by not recording anything without explicit permission. I won’t touch on the legality of this as I believe that basic respect for each other should be enough to prevent any issues. You will take part in larger meetings where recording may be standard and in such cases this should be made explicit.</p>
<p>Thanks to Giles Reger and Sarah Clinch for the text above 🙏</p>
