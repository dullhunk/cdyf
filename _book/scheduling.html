<p>You might find it a bit scary thinking about your future. You might be tempted to procrastinate making important decisions about your future, see figure <a href="scheduling.html#fig:schedule-fig">19.1</a>. There is a risk of getting stuck in a <code>do-nothing</code> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting"><code>busy waiting</code></a> loop. This guidebook is here to help you break out of that loop. One way to breakout of an unproductive loop is to schedule some time every week where you work on personal development and job applications. Doing good applications takes time and you’ll probably find you can’t do as many applications as you might like.</p>

<p>If you’re a University of Manchester student, the live <em>Coding your Future</em> (COMP2CARS) workshops sessions are also here to help.
COMP2CARS complements the second year tutorials (COMP2TUT) at the University of Manchester and takes place in the same slot as COMP2TUT when you meet your personal tutor. See your timetable at <a href="https://timetables.manchester.ac.uk/">timetables.manchester.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<!--They'll be back in September 2021, see [manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/). In the meantime see the *Wednesday Waggle* at [waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk](https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/)-->
<!--[studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/timetable](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/timetable/).-->
<p>For small group sessions and one-to-one meetings with your tutor, if you are not please turn your camera on, see section <a href="scheduling.html#cameras">19.10</a>.</p>
<!--These sessions will revisit themes from semester one if you missed them last semester, we'll also have an open session where we'll tackle whatever issues you need about finding placements and internships during 2021. We'll be meeting at [zoom.us/my/duncanhull](http://zoom.us/my/duncanhull), please sign into zoom with your \@student.manchester.ac.uk account and if you can, -->

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">19.10</span> Cameras on or off?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cameras"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>We would normally expect participants in small meetings (not large ones like lectures) to turn their cameras on but we understand that there are good reasons why people may not be willing/able to and won’t explicitly ask you to.</p>
<div id="why-turn-cameras-on" class="section level3" number="19.10.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">19.10.1</span> Why turn cameras on?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-turn-cameras-on"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There has always been a question around whether to turn cameras on during online meetings but it is even more obvious with online meetings becoming the norm rather than the exception. There is a direct benefit in using cameras in small, personal meetings where many of us make use of visual cues to aid the flow of conversation – at the very least it’s easier to identify who is talking. Additionally, it can help people get along – people might feel more ‘listened to’ if they can see somebody listening and your team will find it easier to remember names etc if they have a face to match the names to.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-not" class="section level3" number="19.10.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">19.10.2</span> Why not?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-not"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There are lots of reasons why not. Most obviously, if you don’t have access to a camera. But you may also be in an environment which you prefer others not to see, you may have anxiety around the issue, or your connection might be too slow. There are many other perfectly reasonable reasons for you not to put your camera on and you should not feel pressured to do this. If you simply say “Sorry, I can’t turn my camera on today” then nobody will ask any further and they should never explicitly ask you to turn it on.</p>
</div>
<div id="being-appropriate" class="section level3" number="19.10.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">19.10.3</span> Being appropriate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#being-appropriate"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>You should already be treating online meetings like physical ones e.g. turning up on time, being prepared, listening, engaging etc. Similarly, if people can see you then you should ensure you are wearing appropriate clothes (wearing clothes is the absolute minimum here!) and in an appropriate place (the bathroom is probably not appropriate) as you would for a physical meeting.</p>
</div>
<div id="respecting-others" class="section level3" number="19.10.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">19.10.4</span> Respecting others<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#respecting-others"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>If other people have decided to turn their cameras on then we ask that you show them respect by not recording anything without their explicit permission. We won’t touch on the legality of this as we believe that basic respect for each other should be enough to prevent any issues. You will take part in larger meetings where recording may be standard and in such cases this should be made explicit.</p>
