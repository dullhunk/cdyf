<p>In 2005, the scientist and engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Bourne">Phil Bourne</a> starting publishing a series of articles which distilled people’s hard won knowledge into <em><a href="https://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules">Ten Simple Rules</a></em>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-Bourne2005" role="doc-biblioref">Bourne 2005</a>)</span> Over a decade more than 1000 rules were published in over 100 articles in the scientific journal <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_Computational_Biology">PLOS Computational Biology</a></em>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-Bourne2018" role="doc-biblioref">Bourne et al. 2018</a>)</span> These articles offer a huge range of advice from making the most of a summer internship <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-Aicher2017" role="doc-biblioref">Aicher et al. 2017</a>)</span> to teaching programming <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-tensimplebrown" role="doc-biblioref">N.

<p>There is a lot more to you than your degree. There is a lot more to you than your grades. Yes, you’ve spent (or will be spending) three or four years getting your degree. Use this time to identify your weaknesses and work out how to improve them. Knowing your future depends on knowing who you are now, see chapter <a href="knowing#knowing">2</a> and figure <a href="ruling#fig:knowing-fig">14.2</a>.</p>

<!--understand your brand your values, another word for brand is reputation. do people like you. The better you know yourself, the better-->
<p>Being able to articulate your self-awareness to employers will make writing a CV (chapter <a href="debugging#debugging">6</a>) and interviewing (chapter <a href="speaking#speaking">10</a>) a lot easier. Both rely on you be able to express yourself in written and spoken language. You should aim to strike a balance between humbly underselling yourself (see section <a href="finding#undersell">8.4.5</a>) and proudly overselling yourself, see section <a href="finding#oversell">8.4.4</a>. If you have digital profiles like those described in section <a href="finding#portfolio">8.3.3</a>, how accurate a reflection of you are they? Is your digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego">alter ego</a> at odds with reality?</p>

<p>Studying at University can be enjoyable but it can also make you stressed, anxious and depressed. If you neglect to look after yourself mentally and physically, things can start to fall apart. Choose your reference points carefully, try not to compare yourself to the person at the top of the class: see Carmen’s advice in chapter <a href="carmen#carmen">24</a>. Ask yourself, am I doing better than last time? Be kind to yourself because nurturing yourself now will nurture your future, see chapter <a href="nurturing#nurturing">3</a>.</p>

<p>At University, you are quite likely to be surrounded by people who have more experience, better knowledge, higher grades or more skills than you. That might not have been the case at high school if you were top (or near the top) of your class. While it is natural to compare yourself to the best, you should do so with caution. The important thing is that you are working to towards the best version of yourself, not necessarily the best in your class anymore.</p>

<p>Getting a job offer is competitive and can be cut-throat. You might find yourself falling into poor habits of mind:</p>

<li>“<em>If I had more experience, more voluntary work, more internships, I’d stand a better chance…</em>” see section <a href="experiencing#areuexperienced">7.3</a>

<li>“<em>If I’d done more projects and extra-curricular activities…</em>” etc see section <a href="debugging#mycvpj">6.6.4</a>

<p>Coulda. Woulda. Shoulda. This is all the usual dialogue you can expect from your inner critic. Acknowledge these thoughts, see section <a href="nurturing#lays">3.4</a>, then try distance yourself from them. Start from where you are, use whatever you have and help who you can.</p>

<p>Mistakes and failure are inevitable in life, but productive mistakes are going to help you much more that unproductive ones <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-henrypetroski" role="doc-biblioref">Petroski 1992</a>)</span>. That doesn’t just mean you should “<em>fail fast, fail often</em>” <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-failfast" role="doc-biblioref">Babineaux 2013</a>)</span> or “<em>move fast and break things</em>”, but to consciously learn from any mistakes you make so that you don’t repeat them. One way to turn unproductive mistakes into productive ones is deliberately and consciously reflect on why you made them. This is part of the growth mindset we discussed in chapter <a href="nurturing#nurturing">3</a>.</p>
<p>In a growth mindset, mistakes can be good, but the fear of making them is not. You are more likely to take more chances when you’re unafraid to fail, and this will improve your chances of success.</p>
<p>Many education systems around the world don’t teach people how to fail, because they put too much emphasis on success (as measured by grades and rewards) rather than progress, learning and happiness. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-failgift" role="doc-biblioref">Lahey 2016</a>; <a href="reading#ref-punished" role="doc-biblioref">Kohn 2018</a>)</span> So as the angel investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson">Esther Dyson</a> once said, “Always make new mistakes”, see figure <a href="ruling#fig:esther-dyson-fig">14.7</a></p>

<li>If you’ve got some harsh feedback on your CV, how can you make less buggy in the future?</li>
<li>If you’ve applied to lots of companies and not even had a reply yet, how you improve your job search strategy?</li>
<li>If you’ve neglected to develop interests and projects outside of work, how can you rebalance?</li>
<li>If you crashed and burned in an interview, how can you use the experience to do better next time?</li>
<li>If you failed to get the promotion you thought you deserved, what will you do differently in the future</li>

<p>Research has shown that we often to learn more when we are uncomfortable. You will often learn more when you step outside your comfort zone and reach for things that push your limits. Sometimes when you think you are learning. Learning is an active process that requires you to do things rather than just being a passive observer or consumer. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-sigman23" role="doc-biblioref">Deslauriers et al. 2019</a>; <a href="reading#ref-sigman23-extra" role="doc-biblioref">Barshay 2022</a>)</span></p>
<p>Am I being insensitive asking people to step outside their comfort zone when we’ve all be stretched beyond breaking point during COVID-19, climate change and global economic turmoil? We’re all going to need to continue to step outside of our respective comfort zones in order to meet the challenges we face around the world, see figure <a href="ruling#fig:comfortzone-fig">14.11</a>.</p>
