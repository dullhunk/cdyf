<p>Employers won’t expect you to have lots of <code>experience`` or</code>projects`` at this stage, but any that you do have will help your application stand out. It doesn’t have to be paid experience: Volunteering, getting involved in competitions as a competitor or organiser will help see chapter <a href="experiencing#experiencing">5</a></p>

<p>Rejection is a normal part of job hunting, you need to learn to live with it and not take it personally (ref). You only need one job offer</p>

</h2>
<p>The best time to start applying is September, and the time of year you apply will determine what kind of opportunities are availalbe, see (ref). Big employers tend to close their applications anytime between September and December. If you’ve not found anything you like by January, you can change your job search strategy (ref)</p>

</h2>
<p>In the UK, around 50% of students go back to their placement</p>
<p>We don’t currently have good data on how many students get return offers, but a placement (or internship) is a bit like a long job interview. If they like you, it is likely you’ll receive an offer to return when you graduate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to land a placement without any prior experience?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, see @ref{qexp}</p>

</h2>
<p>Your University can <em>help</em> you but ultimately finding a job is your responsbility, not the University see (ref). Talk to your peers, make use of PASS, network (ref) go to careers fairs, put yourself out there, see Jonathan’s story <a href="jonathan#jonathan">28</a>.</p>
<p>Speak to your employability tutor and careers service. If you’re a Manchester student, keep an eye on the Wednesday Waggle.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the pay for the meta internship?</li>

<p>Google it</p>

</h2>
<p>Did they pay for accommodation/flights ect. or was it up to you?</p>
<p>It is possible to do a placement outside the UK, but it takes more organisation and there are more checks the University has to do to approve your placement.</p>

<p>If you’re serious about finding a placement, you will be able to get one. However, it isn’t easy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Running out of time</li>
<li>Underestimating what is involved</li>
<li>Not doing enough applications (optimising quality at the expense of quantity)</li>
<li>Doing too many applications (optimising quantity at the expense of quality)</li>

</h2>
<p>Varies with employer. This is a good question to ask in interview e.g. ``Do you have any questions for us’’. Some employers give students internal projects never see the light of day.</p>
<p>Other employers will throw you in at the deep-end.</p>
<p>If you’d like more responsibility you should ask for it, but you might have to prove yourself first and earn the trust and respect of your manager.</p>

</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of working for bigger organisation is they will often have established training programs you can take part of.</p>
<p>Startups tend to be a bit more <code>seat of your pants</code> style training, which can also be valuable.</p>
<p>Whever you work, you should always ask for training</p>

<p>If you’re lucky, your employers may help you find accommodation, they might even be able to put you in touch with other students employed by them.</p>
<p>But like finding the job, the accommodation is your responsbility to sort out, which can be stressful. E.g. finding a place to live in London where it is more expensive than Manchester.</p>
<p>#3 How to negotiate payment if it is not shown on the employers website?</p>
<p>Some employers drive a hard bargain and look to pay you the minimum they can get away with.</p>
<p>So, know your value (ref) and prepare to negotiate. Learn how to negotiate better (ref)</p>
