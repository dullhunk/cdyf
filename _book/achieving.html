<p>We are all in a lifelong learning loop. As we iterate around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop">while loop</a> of life, we continually gain more experience, develop new skills and knowledge. As you loop your own personal loop, you will also collect evidence of your personal and professional achievements. Some of these achievements can be certified or “badged” in various ways. This evidence can be collected as part of your professional identity and reputation, that’s the jar called <code>ME</code> shown in figure <a href="achieving#fig:while-learning-fig">18.1</a>.</p>

<p>Evidence is a key part of the “Context, Action, Result and Evidence” (<code>C.A.R.E.</code>) stories described in section <a href="debugging#care">8.7.3</a>. S o what evidence can you collect and how you can certify or badge these credentials, sometimes known as micro-credentials? 📛 <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-microc" role="doc-biblioref">Horton 2020</a>)</span></p>

<p>One kind of badge you get when you finish University is your degree certificate like the one shown in figure <a href="achieving#fig:degree-cert-fig">18.2</a>. A degree certificate is an important offline physical (paper) badge that marks a milestone in your career. If you like gaming, its a huge <code>achievement unlocked</code> that will take you to the next level. Your certificate also tells people that you were a member of a particular University community and that you mastered your chosen discipline to some level, Bachelors, Masters or PhD.</p>

<p>Degree certificates are an important badge, but they don’t give very many details of your professional and personal story while at University. You could give more details by providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>your overall degree classification: first, second, third etc</li>
<li>your individual module grades, for example in an academic transcript or by listing them on your CV, see section <a href="debugging#mycved">8.6.2</a>
</li>
<li>your projects, see section <a href="debugging#mycvpj">8.6.4</a>
</li>
<li>your portfolio of work, if you have one</li>
</ul>
<p>This data give a <em>bit</em> more detail that a degree certificate does not but it is limited to purely academic achievements. You are <em>much</em> more than your grades, because there’s a lot about your character that is difficult or impossible to measure, see figure <a href="achieving#fig:more-than-grades-fig">18.3</a>.</p>

<p>Employers will often want to see more detailed evidence of your character and your softer skills than those provided by degree certificates and grades. While academic achievements paint some broad brushstrokes of your professional identity shown in figure <a href="achieving#fig:fine-grained-fig">18.4</a>, they don’t help employers see the finer details or much of the evidence.</p>

<p>Digital badges provide a solution to this problem, just like your degree certificate is a verified badge of your achievements, a digital badge does the same but in a digital way. Rather than being physical, a digital badge is virtual and transferable. It’s just a <code>*.png</code> graphic file which has been digitally signed and contains metadata. This means it can be displayed on your CV, on social media such as LinkedIn or “stacked” into a digital portfolio collection as shown in figure <a href="achieving#fig:badge-properties-fig">18.5</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation">Mozilla Foundation</a> have defined an open standard for digital badges <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-openbadges" role="doc-biblioref">Anon 2019b</a>)</span> so that badges can be issued, hosted and certified by different organisations. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading#ref-belshaw" role="doc-biblioref">Belshaw 2019</a>)</span></p>

<p>A digital badge has certified data locked inside (shown in figure <a href="achieving#fig:data-inside-fig">18.6</a>) which details the achievement it has been awarded for including:</p>

The data inside a badge is shown in figure <a href="achieving#fig:skills-bills-fig">18.10</a> and gives an employer a more detailed and evidenced view of your professional development than traditional physical badges like degree certificates.</p>
