<p>We are all in a lifelong learning loop. As we iterate around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop">while loop</a> of life, we continually gain more experience, develop new skills and knowledge. As you loop your own personal loop, you will also collect evidence of your personal and professional achievements. Some of these achievements can be certified or “badged” in various ways. This evidence can be collected as part of your professional identity and reputation, that’s the jar called <code>ME</code> shown in figure <a href="achieving#fig:while-learning-fig">23.1</a>.</p>

<p>Evidence is a key part of the “Context, Action, Result and Evidence” (<code>C.A.R.E.</code>) stories described in section <a href="debugging#care">8.7.8</a>. So what evidence can you collect and how you can certify or badge these achievements, sometimes known as micro-credentials <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-microc">Horton 2020</a>; <a href="reading.html#ref-sigman39">Ward et al. 2023</a>)</span> or digital credentials <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-digitalcredentials">Camilleri, Muramatsu, and Schmidt 2022</a>)</span>? 📛</p>
<p>Your future is bright, your future needs achieving, so let’s start achieving your future.</p>

<p>One kind of badge you get when you finish University is your degree certificate like the one shown in figure <a href="achieving#fig:degree-cert-fig">23.2</a>. A degree certificate is an important offline physical (paper) badge that marks a milestone in your career. If you like gaming, its a huge <code>achievement unlocked</code> that will take you to the next level. Your certificate also tells people that you were a member of a particular University community and that you mastered your chosen discipline to some level, Bachelors, Masters or PhD.</p>

<p>Degree certificates are an important badge, but they don’t give very many details of your professional and personal story while at University. You could give more details by providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>your overall degree classification: first, second, third etc</li>
<li>your individual module grades, for example in an academic transcript or by listing them on your CV, see section <a href="debugging#education">8.7.3</a>
</li>
<li>your projects, see section <a href="debugging#projects">8.7.5</a>
</li>
<li>your portfolio of work, if you have one</li>
</ul>
<p>This data give a <em>bit</em> more detail that a degree certificate does not but it is limited to purely academic achievements. You are <em>much</em> more than your grades, because there’s a lot about your character that is difficult or impossible to measure, see figure <a href="achieving#fig:more-than-grades-fig">23.3</a>.</p>

<p>Employers will often want to see more detailed evidence of your character and your softer skills than those provided by degree certificates and grades. While academic achievements paint some broad brushstrokes of your professional identity shown in figure <a href="achieving#fig:fine-grained-fig">23.4</a>, they don’t help employers see the finer details or much of the evidence.</p>

<p>Digital badges provide a solution to this problem, just like your degree certificate is a verified badge of your achievements, a digital badge does the same but in a digital way. Rather than being physical, a digital badge is virtual and transferable. It’s just a <code>*.png</code> graphic file which has been digitally signed and contains metadata. This means it can be displayed on your CV, on social media such as LinkedIn or “stacked” into a digital portfolio collection as shown in figure <a href="achieving#fig:badge-properties-fig">23.5</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation">Mozilla Foundation</a> have defined an open standard for digital badges <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-openbadges">E. Byte 2019</a>)</span> so that badges can be issued, hosted and certified by different organisations. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-belshaw">Belshaw 2019</a>)</span></p>

<p>A digital badge has certified data locked inside (shown in figure <a href="achieving#fig:data-inside-fig">23.6</a>) which details the achievement it has been awarded for including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>recipient</code> that’s you!</li>
<li>
<code>issuer</code> the organisation awarding the badge, e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/PoppletonUni">Poppleton University</a>
</li>
<li>
<code>badge name</code> e.g. PASS leader badge (see figure <a href="achieving#fig:pass-leader-fig">23.7</a>)</li>
<li>
<code>badge image</code> e.g. a digital logo</li>
<li>
<code>evidence URL</code> a link to evidence

<p>Some answers to the most Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) we’ve received about Microsoft Fundamentals Certifications (MFC):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>What is the pass grade?</strong> You need to achieve <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exam-scoring-reports">a scaled score of 700 to pass</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-micropass">Sullivan and Pachatt 2024</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I retake the exams?</strong> Yes, scroll down to <code>Microsoft Fundamentals</code> to see the <a href="https://certiport.pearsonvue.com/Educator-resources/Exam-policies/Retake">retake policy</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I see the course material?</strong> Yes, it’s all online, follow the <code>learn.microsoft.com</code> links in section <a href="achieving#microsoft">23.4.1</a>. You don’t need to be enrolled or logged in to see the basic course material, although you will need to login using your University credentials to save and record your progress through the courses. Before the exams, we’ll also give you access codes for the extra materials to students who registered</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I take the exam at another time?</strong> Yes, if none of the dates we offer work for you, we expect to offer more in-person examination dates during term-time for students who can’t be in Manchester in August. So you can study in the summer, and take the exam at a later date</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I take the exam online?</strong> Unfortunately not (yet). We are not convinced that the authentication procedures for online exams are currently robust enough for us to be confident about <em>who</em> is actually sitting the exam online</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I take multiple exams?</strong> Yes, but bear in mind that each one requires about 20 hours of study, so if you sign up to all eight, you’ll have a busy summer! You’ll also have to make time to sit eight seperate in-person examinations.</li>
<li>
<strong>What am I committing to?</strong> At this point we’re looking for expressions of interest, rather than a firm commitment that you’ll <strong>definintely</strong> sit the exam(s) in the summer. So you can change your mind, it’s called <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/teaching-and-learning-excellence/flexible-learning/">flexible learning</a> for a reason. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-georgepettifer">George and Pettifer 2022</a>)</span> Having said that, please only register if you’re reasonably serious about starting the course(s) as the examinations and gmetrix licenses aren’t free.</li>
<li>
<strong>Can you offer Amazon or Google exams as well?</strong> Not yet, but we may do in the future, see section <a href="achieving#otherbadges">23.4</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I continue studying for these exams after the summer?</strong> Yes, provided you are still a student at the University</li>
<li>
<strong>How difficult are the exams?</strong> That depends on who you are and what your background is, they are designed for <code>Beginner</code> level (students) but Microsoft aren’t very clear about what that means in practice. If you’re not sure, take a look at the free course materials online to work out if the courses are right for you</li>
<li>
<strong>When are the exams exactly?</strong> Multiple examination slots are available during May, June and July. If you can’t make any of them, you’ll be able to take the exams at a later date, most likely from September onwards during term-time.</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I change exams?</strong> Yes, you can change your mind about which courses you want to do after registering, because you’ll have access to all eight courses.</li>
<li>
<strong>Which courses did I sign up for?</strong> It doesn’t actually matter which courses you signed up for as you already have access to all eight courses described in section <a href="achieving#microsoft">23.4.1</a>, follow the links to the course(s) you are interested in.</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I still do these exams in my final year of study?</strong> Yes, for <a href="http://www.graduation.manchester.ac.uk/after-youve-graduated/your-it-account-and-library-access/">as long as you have access to your <code>@student.manchester.ac.uk</code> email</a> address <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-graduandemail">T. Byte 2024c</a>)</span>. These digital badges are portable too, if you <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/support/learn-profile-manage">add a personal email address to your learn.microsoft.com account</a>, you can take these digital badges (and resources) with you when you graduate (and your email expires). <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-persosoft">D. T. Joseph, Johnson, and Buck 2024</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>What has the University bought?</strong> The basic course materials are freely available at <code>learn.microsoft.com</code>, the University has bought some extra services from <a href="https://www.prodigylearning.com/certifications/microsoft/microsoft-certified-fundementals/">prodigylearning.com</a> to help you practice the exams including quizzes via <a href="https://www.gmetrix.net">gmetrix.net</a> and . All the exams described in section <a href="achieving#microsoft">23.4.1</a> above have extra material in gmetrix apart from the <em>Dynamics</em> course which doesn’t yet have training available yet. Practise tests are available in gmetrix so you can still take those assessments.</li>
<li>
<strong>I am a member of staff, can I take these exams?</strong> Yes, its possible to take these exams as a member of staff, but it can’t be funded through the Flexible Learning Program which only funds student learning, not staff development. Talk to your line manager in the first instance about finding funding to take these exams as a member of staff.</li>
<li>
<strong>Does the University pay for alumni to take these exams?</strong> Not at the current time</li>
<li>
<strong>Do I need to be studying Computer Science?</strong> No, these courses are aimed at beginners and professionals who have what Microsoft call a “Basic familiarity with IT terms and concepts” as a prerequisite.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have focussed on technical achievements here, but there are non-technical achievements too, see for example chapter <a href="verbalising#verbalising">10</a>.</p>
