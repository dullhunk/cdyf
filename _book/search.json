Sorry. Yeah, ’s going past carry . , ’s exciting, whole going education process like GCSE like level , know, point think good firm like know ground footwork. ’s really helped , know, made incremental kind development came subject like obviously enjoyed don’t bit computing,GCSE computing?Sneha: Yes. -level well. Yeah, right. Okay, ’s just school offered thought know didn’t like primary school nothing think really helped like enjoyed also like know well . thought know maybe like know good obviously good prospect field like another thing always say right balance creativity like know problem solving trying get use brain like creative sides. ’m like, know, artistic lot artwork things. like, know, kind outlet sense well. like, progressive nature subject means, like, know, start small get bigger bigger bigger, get feedback go steps. really enjoyed, know, right?
