<p>Congratulations, you’ve been invited to an interview. It might be a telephone, video or face-to-face, or it might even be as part of an assessment centre where you’ll be asked to complete several other tasks and tests. Being invited to an interview means that your CV, along with any accompanying covering letters, application forms or digital portfolios, have hit the target. All that reading and writing has paid off. BULLSEYE! 🎯</p>

<p>Having passed the first stage, you move onto speaking and listening which you’ll do in a live interview. One of your goals is to convince the interviewers that you can articulate yourself clearly, and communicate well using spoken natural language, while listening carefully to questions that they ask. This is fundamental skill discussed in section <a href="writing.html#cio">4.3</a> on communication I/O.</p>
<p>If you’ve got an interview, you can feel good about having a bug-free CV shown in Figure <a href="speaking.html#fig:bugfree-fig">10.1</a>. But now you have a new set of problems. How can you prepare for the interview? What kinds of interviews exist and what questions might you be asked? If they offer you a job, how will you negotiate the terms, conditions and salary? Do you <em>really</em> want the job anyway and are they the kind of people you actually want to work with everyday? You’ll be giving this employer:</p>
<ul>
<li>most of the hours of your day</li>
<li>most of the days of your week</li>
<li>most of the weeks of your year</li>
<li>something like the next two years of your life <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-jonathanblack" role="doc-biblioref">Black 2017</a>)</span> as the first part of up to 80,000 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>So you want to ensure employers are a good match and not going to waste your time.</p>

<li>non-technical interview, sometimes called competency based interview or HR interview (human resources)</li>

</h3>
<p>Competency interviews are there to test your soft skills, find out what you’re like, how you work in a team, if you can communicate well. Here are some common competency interview questions. Imagine you are going on a stage, prepare lines that answer these questions, rehearse them out loud in front of a mirror (or a critical friend).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What roles can you play in a team?</li>
<li>Tell me about a time when you showed integrity and professionalism</li>
<li>Can you give an example of a situation where you solved a problem in a creative way?</li>
<li>Tell me about a big decision you’ve made recently. How did you go about it?</li>
<li>Give an example of a time you handled or resolved conflict</li>
<li>How do you maintain healthy working relationships with your colleagues?</li>
<li>Describe a project where you had to use different leadership styles to reach your goal</li>
<li>Give me an example of a challenge you faced and tell me how you overcame it</li>
<li>How do you influence people in a situation with conflicting agendas?</li>
<li>Tell me about a time that you made a decision and then changed your mind.</li>
<li>Tell me about a time when you achieved success even when the odds were stacked against you.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more examples of non-technical questions see:</p>

<p>Many employers using technical or coding interviews to assess your harder skills. Not every employer does, but they are widely used by employers. Preparing for coding interviews is a good way to become a better engineer, so even if you don’t have to face a series of really tough coding interviews, it is worth knowing about them.</p>
<!-- I Cheated on My Microsoft Interview you can cheat [@cheating]


1. Using a whiteboard (or even google docs), you're unlikely to have access to a compiler or an IDE
1. Pattern matching (what interview questions are similar to this)
1. Simplify and generalise (tweak constraints, then does that approach )
1. Clarify the question, state your assumptions
1. Base case and build () start from n = 1, then build to n = 2 etc [@polya]
1. Show your working, talk out loud, mention trade-offs of your approach^[gayle video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0B4mOtwX0]


Solving different coding challenges can help you become a better problem solver, master a given programming language, prepare for job interviews and learn new algorithms. It will help you become a better engineer and can provide good evidence for the experience section of your CV.-->
<p>There are a lots of resources to help you prepare for and practice coding interview questions, the best place to start is <em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell">Gayle Laakmaan McDowell</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-cracking" role="doc-biblioref">McDowell 2015</a>)</span> As well as reading Gayle’s book, there are lots of online resources to help you prepare for coding interviews. Before we look at those, University of Manchester Computer Science graduate Petia Davidova explains in figure <a href="speaking.html#fig:petia-fig">10.3</a> what she learned from failing several coding interviews at big technology companies. 😭</p>

<p>Coding interviews can be tough, but preparing for them, and doing them will make you a better engineer. So if you spectacularly wipeout in your coding interview, reflect and think how can you improve next time? Perhaps you need to</p>
<ul>
<li>Read up on some more data structures</li>
<li>Familiarise yourself with more algorithms</li>
<li>Practice thinking out loud (verbally) by doing a mock technical interview?</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things will help both your general professional development and your chances of success in future technical interviews.</p>

Figure 10.7: In their own words, ICPC is “an algorithmic programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world.” <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-icpc" role="doc-biblioref">Hacker 2021</a>)</span>

<p>ICPC is organised by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery">Association for Computing Machinery</a> (ACM), a global community which advances computing as a science and a profession.</p>
<p>There are subregional contests for ICPC, so in the UK there is the United Kingdom and Ireland Programming Competition (UKIEPC) which is part of the Northwestern Europe European Regional Contest (NWERC).</p>
<p>UKIEPC has been held annually since 2013 to help universities pick teams to travel to NWERC. Ask your University if they are involved, see <a href="http://ukiepc.info">ukiepc.info</a>. If they aren’t involved yet, you could encourage them to join. It’s not just about winning, it’s also about taking part.</p>

<!--### changing your mind

You may decide to change your mind about an offer you've already accepted. You need to

* Are you sure? Think it through carefully, discuss your options with friends and family.
* Read your contract of employment again: there may be clauses in your contract describing the consequences of changing your mind - make sure you understand these
* Tell the employer quickly: explain why you've changed your mind (personal circumstances, you have a better offer etc) the sooner the better
* Learn from this mistake: it's not good to accept offers you're not serious about so try to learn from this mistake so you don't repeat it in the future

  IANAL [1] but according to Professor Google:

  Can I decline a job offer after signing the contract?
