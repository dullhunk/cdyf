<p>Congratulations, you’ve been invited to an interview. It might be by telephone, video link, in person or as part of an assessment centre where you’ll be asked to complete several other tasks and tests. Being invited to an interview means that your written application (CV, covering letter, application form or digital portfolio) has hit the target and is bug free, see figure <a href="speaking.html#fig:bugfree-fig">10.1</a>. All that reading and writing has paid off. BULLSEYE! 🎯</p>

<p>Having passed the first stage of <em>reading and writing</em>, you move onto <em>listening and speaking</em> stage of interviewing. One of your goals is to convince the interviewers that you can articulate yourself clearly, and communicate well by listening carefully to their questions and answering with spoken natural language. These are fundamental communication skills discussed in section <a href="writing.html#cio">4.4</a> on communication I/O.</p>
<p>If you’ve got an interview, you can feel good about having a bug-free CV shown in figure <a href="speaking.html#fig:bugfree-fig">10.1</a>. Now you have a new set of problems to tackle. How can you prepare for the interview? What kinds of interviews exist and what questions might you be asked? If they offer you a job, how will you negotiate the terms, conditions and salary? Do you <em>really</em> want the job and are they the kind of people you actually want to work with everyday? If successful, you will be giving this employer:</p>
<ul>
<li>most of the hours of your day</li>
<li>most of the days of your week</li>
<li>most of the weeks of your year</li>
</ul>
<p>This job will take a significant chunk of the next few months, year or even up to two years (and more) for a graduate scheme <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-jonathanblack" role="doc-biblioref">Black 2017</a>)</span>. It’s the start of a much longer journey of up to <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 hours</a> that you’ll spend in employment during your life.</p>
<p>So you want to ensure employers are a good match and not going to waste your time. You’ll be interviewing them, as well as them interviewing you, so it will pay to have some questions prepared alongside your answers to questions you can anticipate.</p>

<p>Competency interviews test some of your softer skills, find out who you are (see chapter <a href="knowing.html#knowing">2</a>), how you work in a team and if you can communicate well. A good interview strategy for any interview is to talk about what you are doing (and what you have done) as shown in figure <a href="speaking.html#fig:overthinking-fig">10.3</a>. It might even help to have a checklist in your head of things you’d like to talk about e.g. one work experience (see chapter <a href="experiencing.html#experiencing">5</a>), one personal project and two uni projects, see section <a href="debugging.html#mycvpj">7.6.4</a>. If you can, make sure you’ve mentioned everything on your checklist by the end of the interview.</p>

<p>Here are some common competency interview questions. Imagine you are going on a stage, prepare lines that answer these questions, rehearse them out loud in front of a mirror (or a critical friend).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What roles do you play in a team, with examples?</li>
<li>Tell me about a time when you showed integrity and professionalism</li>
<li>Can you give an example of a situation where you solved a problem in a creative way?</li>
<li>Tell me about a big decision you’ve made recently. How did you go about it?</li>
<li>Give an example of a time you resolved conflict</li>
<li>How do you maintain healthy working relationships with your team?</li>
<li>Describe a project where you had to use different leadership styles to reach your goal</li>
<li>Give me an example of a challenge you faced and tell me how you overcame it</li>
<li>How do you influence people in a situation with conflicting agendas?</li>
<li>Tell me about a time that you made a decision and then changed your mind.</li>
<li>Tell me about a time when you achieved success even when the odds were stacked against you.</li>
<li>Tell me about a time when you have provided an excellent service</li>
<li>Give me an example of a time when you have had multiple deadlines to meet? How did prioritise your workload?</li>
<li>What would you say is your main development area?</li>

</h3>
<p>Many employers use technical or coding interviews to assess your harder skills. Not every employer does, but they are widely used by employers. Preparing for coding interviews is a good way to become a better engineer, so even if you don’t have to face a series of really tough coding interviews, it is worth knowing about them.</p>
<div class="rmdcaution">
<p>⚠️ <strong>Coding Caution</strong> ⚠️</p>
<p>The competitive coding and technical interviews described in this chapter test a narrow set of algorithmic skills. While it’s important to prepare for technical interviews, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-criticisms-of-Cracking-the-Coding-interview">they have well documented limitations</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-murashenkov" role="doc-biblioref">Murashenkov 2019</a>)</span> Skills required for software engineering go beyond the purely technical ones. For example, your (soft) communication skills outlined in chapter <a href="writing.html#writing">4</a>, and many other broader skills, are just as important as your (hard) technical abilities.</p>
</div>
<!-- I Cheated on My Microsoft Interview you can cheat [@cheating]


1. Using a whiteboard (or even google docs), you're unlikely to have access to a compiler or an IDE
1. Pattern matching (what interview questions are similar to this)
1. Simplify and generalise (tweak constraints, then does that approach )
1. Clarify the question, state your assumptions
1. Base case and build () start from n = 1, then build to n = 2 etc [@polya]
1. Show your working, talk out loud, mention trade-offs of your approach^[gayle video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0B4mOtwX0]


Solving different coding challenges can help you become a better problem solver, master a given programming language, prepare for job interviews and learn new algorithms. It will help you become a better engineer and can provide good evidence for the experience section of your CV.-->
<p>There are a lots of resources to help you prepare for and practice coding interview questions, the best place to start is <em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_Laakmann_McDowell">Gayle Laakmaan McDowell</a>. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-cracking" role="doc-biblioref">McDowell 2015</a>)</span> As well as reading Gayle’s book, there are lots of online resources to help you prepare for coding interviews. Before we look at those, University of Manchester Computer Science graduate Petia Davidova explains in figure <a href="speaking.html#fig:petia-fig">10.4</a> what she learned from failing several coding interviews at big technology companies. 😭</p>

<p>Coding interviews can be tough, but preparing for them, and doing them will make you a better engineer. So if you spectacularly wipeout in your coding interview, reflect and think how can you improve next time? Perhaps you need to</p>
<ul>
<li>Read up on some more data structures</li>
<li>Familiarise yourself with more algorithms</li>
<li>Practice thinking out loud (verbally) by doing a mock technical interview?</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these activities will help both your general professional development and your chances of success in future technical interviews. Thankfully there are plenty of resources out there for helping you get better at coding interviews, so let’s have a look at some. Some of these resources are more about problem solving for recreation, rather than interview preparation, but they will all help you become a better engineer.</p>

<p>HackerRank allows developers to practice their coding skills, prepare for interviews and get hired. HackerRank allows users to submit applications and apply to jobs by solving company-sponsored coding challenges. Some employers use hackerrank as part of the interviewing process, so these are not just academic exercises.</p>
<p>Hacker Rank provide a discussion and leaderboard for every challenge, and most challenges come with an editorial that explains more about the challenge, see <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">hackerrank.com</a> and figure <a href="speaking.html#fig:hackerrank-fig">10.7</a></p>

<p>ICPC is organised by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery">Association for Computing Machinery</a> (ACM), a global community which advances computing as a science and a profession.</p>
<p>There are subregional contests for ICPC, so in the UK there is the United Kingdom and Ireland Programming Competition (UKIEPC) which is part of the Northwestern Europe European Regional Contest (NWERC).</p>
<p>UKIEPC has been held annually since 2013 to help universities pick teams to travel to NWERC. Ask your University if they are involved, see <a href="http://ukiepc.info">ukiepc.info</a>. If they aren’t involved yet, you could encourage them to join. It’s not just about winning, it’s also about taking part.</p>

<!--### changing your mind

You may decide to change your mind about an offer you've already accepted. You need to

* Are you sure? Think it through carefully, discuss your options with friends and family.
* Read your contract of employment again: there may be clauses in your contract describing the consequences of changing your mind - make sure you understand these
* Tell the employer quickly: explain why you've changed your mind (personal circumstances, you have a better offer etc) the sooner the better
* Learn from this mistake: it's not good to accept offers you're not serious about so try to learn from this mistake so you don't repeat it in the future

  IANAL [1] but according to Professor Google:

<p>Interviews are about a lot more than the answers you give to questions, they also test <em>how</em> you communicate. We looked at communication skills in section <a href="writing.html#cio">4.4</a> and throughout chapter <a href="writing.html#writing">4</a> on <em>writing your future</em>. This chapter has discussed some spoken communication skills which complement your written communication skills.</p>

<p>Computing is not just about technology - it is actually more about working with and for people, see figure <a href="speaking.html#fig:carole-goble-fig">10.9</a>. So as well as testing technical knowledge, an interview (coding interview or otherwise) is a test of <em>how</em> you communicate in spoken language, not just how you speak, but how you listen and converse. <span class="citation">(<a href="reading.html#ref-frengoble" role="doc-biblioref">Goble 2020</a>)</span></p>
